<paratext> I. 1. 
<paratext>
Awake, Aeolian lyre, awake, 
And give to rapture all thy trembling strings. 
From Helicon's harmonious springs 
A thousand rills their mazy progress take: 
The laughing flowers, that round them blow, 
Drink life and fragrance as they flow. 
Now the rich stream of music winds along, 
Deep, majestic, smooth, and strong, 
Through verdant vales and Ceres' golden reign: 
Now rowling down the steep amain, 
Headlong, impetuous, see it pour: 
The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar. 
<paratext>
<paratext> I. 2. 
<paratext>
Oh! Sovereign of the willing soul, 
Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs, 
Enchanting shell! the sullen Cares 
And frantic Passions hear thy soft control. 
On Thracia's hills the Lord of War, 
Has curbed the fury of his car, 
And dropped his thirsty lance at thy command. 
Perching on the sceptered hand 
Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feathered king 
With ruffled plumes and flagging wing: 
Quenched in dark clouds of slumber lie 
The terror of his beak, and lightnings of his eye. 
<paratext>
<paratext> I. 3. 
<paratext>
Thee the voice, the dance, obey, 
Tempered to thy warbled lay. 
O'er Idalia's velvet-green 
The rosy-crowned Loves are seen 
On Cytherea's day 
With antic Sports and blue-eyed Pleasures, 
Frisking light in frolic measures; 
Now pursuing, now retreating, 
Now in circling troops they meet: 
To brisk notes in cadence beating 
Glance their many-twinkling feet. 
Slow melting strains their queen's approach declare: 
Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay. 
With arms sublime, that float upon the air, 
In gliding state she wins her easy way: 
O'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move 
The bloom of young desire and purple light of love. 
<paratext>
<paratext> II. 1. 
<paratext>
Man's feeble race what ills await, 
Labour, and penury, the racks of pain, 
Disease, and sorrow's weeping train, 
And death, sad refuge from the storms of fate! 
The fond complaint, my song, disprove, 
And justify the laws of Jove. 
Say, has he given in vain the heavenly Muse? 
Night, and all her sickly dews, 
Her spectres wan, and birds of boding cry, 
He gives to range the dreary sky: 
Till down the eastern cliffs afar 
Hyperion's march they spy, and glittering shafts of war. 
<paratext>
<paratext> II. 2. 
<paratext>
In climes beyond the solar road, 
Where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam, 
The Muse has broke the twilight-gloom 
To cheer the shivering native's dull abode. 
And oft, beneath the odorous shade 
Of Chile's boundless forests laid, 
She deigns to hear the savage youth repeat 
In loose numbers wildly sweet 
Their feather-cinctured chiefs, and dusky loves. 
Her track, where'er the goddess roves, 
Glory pursue, and generous Shame, 
The unconquerable Mind, and Freedom's holy flame. 
<paratext>
<paratext> II. 3. 
<paratext>
Woods that wave o'er Delphi's steep, 
Isles that crown the Aegean deep, 
Fields that cool Ilissus laves, 
Or where Maeander's amber waves 
In lingering lab'rinths creep, 
How do your tuneful echoes languish, 
Mute, but to the voice of anguish? 
Where each old poetic mountain 
Inspiration breathed around: 
Every shade and hallowed fountain 
Murmured deep a solemn sound: 
Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour 
Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains. 
Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant-power, 
And coward Vice that revels in her chains. 
When Latium had her lofty spirit lost, 
They sought, oh Albion! next thy sea-encircled coast. 
<paratext>
<paratext> III. 1. 
<paratext>
Far from the sun and summer-gale, 
In thy green lap was Nature's darling laid, 
What time, where lucid Avon strayed, 
To him the mighty Mother did unveil 
Her awful face: the dauntless child 
Stretched forth his little arms and smiled. 
'This pencil take,' (she said) 'whose colours clear 
Richly paint the vernal year: 
Thine too these golden keys, immortal boy! 
This can unlock the gates of joy; 
Of horror that, and thrilling fears, 
Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic tears.' 
<paratext>
<paratext> III. 2. 
<paratext>
Nor second he, that rode sublime 
Upon the seraph-wings of Ecstasy, 
The secrets of the abyss to spy. 
He passed the flaming bounds of place and time: 
The living throne, the sapphire-blaze, 
Where angels tremble while they gaze, 
He saw; but blasted with excess of light, 
Closed his eyes in endless night. 
Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous car, 
Wide o'er the fields of glory bear 
Two coursers of ethereal race, 
With necks in thunder clothed, and long-resounding pace. 
<paratext>
<paratext> III. 3. 
<paratext>
Hark, his hands the lyre explore! 
Bright-eyed Fancy hovering o'er 
Scatters from her pictured urn 
Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn. 
But ah! 'tis heard no more&mdash; 
Oh! lyre divine, what daring spirit 
Wakes thee now? Though he inherit 
Nor the pride, nor ample pinion, 
That the Theban eagle bear 
Sailing with supreme dominion 
Through the azure deep of air: 
Yet oft before his infant eyes would run 
Such forms, as glitter in the Muse's ray 
With orient hues, unborrowed of the sun: 
Yet shall he mount, and keep his distant way 
Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate, 
Beneath the Good how far&mdash; but far above the Great. 
<atnt1> Awake [up], my glory: awake, lute and harp.<br>
<atnt1> &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>David's Psalms.</em> [Prayer Book version, lvii. 9]<br>
<atnt1> Pindar styles his own poetry with its musical accompanyments, [Greek sentence (omitted), 
<atnt1> translation:], Aeolian song, Aeolian strings, the breath of the Aeolian flute.
<atnt3> The subject and simile, as usual with Pindar, are united. The various sources of 
<atnt3> poetry, which gives life and lustre to all it touches, are here described; its quiet 
<atnt3> majestic progress enriching every subject (otherwise dry and barren) with a pomp 
<atnt3> of diction and luxuriant harmony of numbers; and its more rapid and irresistible course, 
<atnt3> when swoln and hurried away by the conflict of tumultuous passions.
<atnt13> Power of harmony to calm the turbulent sallies of the soul. The thoughts are borrowed 
<atnt13> from the first Pythian of Pindar. [See note to l. 20.]
<atnt20> This is a weak imitation of some incomparable lines in the same Ode. [Pindar, <em>Pythian Ode I</em>, 1-12.]
<atnt25> Power of harmony to produce all the graces of motion in the body.
<atnt35> [Greek line (omitted)] [He (Odysseus) gazed at the quick twinkling of (the dancers') 
<atnt35> feet; and he wondered in his heart.]<br>

<atnt41> [Greek line (omitted)] [And on his rose-red cheeks there gleams the light of love.]<br>
<atnt41> &nbsp; &nbsp; Phrynichus, apud Athenaeum. [<em>Deipnosophistae</em>, xiii. 604a]<br> 
<atnt41> [Modern texts give the line as follows: Greek line (omitted).] 
<atnt42> To compensate the real and imaginary ills of life, the Muse was given to Mankind by the 
<atnt42> same Providence that sends the Day by its chearful presence to dispel the gloom and 
<atnt42> terrors of the Night.
<atnt52> Or seen the Morning's well-appointed Star<br>
<atnt52> Come marching up the eastern hills afar.<br>
<atnt52> &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Cowley. [Brutus, an Ode, st. 4]</em>
<atnt54> Extensive influence of poetic Genius over the remotest and most uncivilized nations: 
<atnt54> its connection with liberty, and the virtues that naturally attend on it. <em>[</em>See the 
<atnt54> Erse, Norwegian, and Welch Fragments, the Lapland and American songs.<em>]</em><br>

<atnt54> <em>Petrarch, Canzon 2. [Canzoniere, 'Canzone II', l. 48]</em>
<atnt66> Progress of Poetry from Greece to Italy, and from Italy to England. Chaucer was not 
<atnt66> unacquainted with the writings of Dante or of Petrarch. The Earl of Surrey and Sir Tho. 
<atnt66> Wyatt had travelled in Italy, and formed their taste there; Spenser imitated the 
<atnt66> Italian writers; Milton improved on them: but this School expired soon after the 
<atnt66> Restoration, and a new one arose on the French model, which has subsisted ever since.

<atnt99> For the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels - And above the firmament, 
<atnt99> that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a 
<atnt99> saphire-stone. - This was the appearance [of the likeness] of the glory of the Lord.<br>

<atnt102> sweet song].<br>

<atnt110> Words, that weep, and tears, that speak.<br>
<atnt110> &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Cowley.</em> ["The Prophet" in <em>The Mistress</em>, line 20]  
<atnt111> We have had in our language no other odes of the sublime kind, than that of Dryden on 
<atnt111> St. Cecilia's day: for Cowley (who had his merit) yet wanted judgment, style, and 
<atnt111> harmony, for such a task. That of Pope is not worthy of so great a man. Mr. Mason 
<atnt111> indeed of late days has touched the true chords, and with a masterly hand, in some of 
<atnt111> his Choruses, - above all in the last of Caractacus,<br>
<atnt111> &nbsp; &nbsp; Hark! heard ye not yon footstep dread? <em>&amp;c.</em>
<atnt115> [Greek line (omitted)] [against the god-like bird of Zeus].<br>
<atnt115> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Pindar] Olymp. 2. [88]<br>Pindar compares himself to that bird, and his 
<atnt115> enemies to ravens that croak and clamour in vain below, while it pursues its flight, 
<atnt115> regardless of their noise.
