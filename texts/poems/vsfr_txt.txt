<paratext> [Verse Fragments]
<paratext>
<paratext> Gratitude
    The Joy that trembles in her eye
    She bows her meek &amp; humble head
                          [...] in silent praise
        [...] beyond the power of Sound.
<paratext>
<paratext> (Mr Pope dead)
    [...] and smart beneath the visionary scourge
    &mdash;'tis Ridicule &amp; not reproach that wounds
    Their vanity &amp; not their conscience feels
    [...] 
    A few shall [...] 
    The cadence of my song repeat
    &amp; hail thee in my words.
