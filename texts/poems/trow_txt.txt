<paratext> Owen succeeded his father Griffin in the principality of 
<paratext> North-Wales, A. D. 1120. This battle was fought near forty 
<paratext> years afterwards.

<paratext> 
Owen's praise demands my song, 
Owen swift, and Owen strong; 
Fairest flower of Roderic's stem, 
Gwyneth's shield and Britain's gem. 
He nor heaps his brooded stores, 
Nor on all profusely pours; 
Lord of every regal art, 
Liberal hand and open heart. 
<paratext>
Big with hosts of mighty name, 
Squadrons three against him came; 
This the force of Eirin hiding; 
Side by side as proudly riding, 
On her shadow long and gay 
Lochlin ploughs the watery way; 
There the Norman sails afar 
Catch the winds and join the war: 
Black and huge along they sweep, 
Burthens of the angry deep. 
<paratext>
Dauntless on his native sands 
The Dragon-son of Mona stands; 
In glittering arms and glory dressed, 
High he rears his ruby crest. 
There the thundering strokes begin, 
There the press and there the din; 
Talymalfra's rocky shore 
Echoing to the battle's roar. 
Where his glowing eye-balls turn, 
Thousand banners round him burn. 
Where he points his purple spear, 
Hasty, hasty Rout is there, 
Marking with indignant eye 
Fear to stop and shame to fly. 
There Confusion, Terror's child, 
Conflict fierce and Ruin wild, 
Agony that pants for breath, 
Despair and honourable Death.
