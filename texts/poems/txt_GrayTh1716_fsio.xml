            <p> In the eleventh century <persName>Sigurd</persName>, Earl of the Orkney Islands, went with a
					fleet of ships and a considerable body of troops into Ireland, to the
					assistance of <persName>Sictryg with the silken beard</persName>, who was then making war on his
					father-in-law <persName>Brian</persName>, King of Dublin: the Earl and all his forces were cut
					to pieces, and <persName>Sictryg</persName> was in danger of a total defeat; but the enemy had a
					greater loss by the death of <persName>Brian</persName>, their King, who fell in the action. On
					Christmas-day (the day of the battle), a native of <placeName>Caithness</placeName>
					in Scotland saw at a distance a number of persons on horseback riding full
					speed towards a hill, and seeming to enter into it. Curiosity led him to
					follow them, till looking through an opening in the rocks he saw twelve
					gigantic figures resembling women: they were all employed about a loom; and
					as they wove, they sung the following dreadful song; which when they had
					finished, they tore the web into twelve pieces, and (each taking her
					portion) galloped six to the north and as many to the south. </p>

									They were mounted on swift horses, with drawn swords in their hands; and in the throng 
									of battle selected such as were destined to slaughter, and conducted them to <emph>Valhalla</emph>, 
									the hall of <emph>Odin</emph>, or paradise of the Brave; where they attended the banquet, 
									and served the departed Heroes with horns of mead and ale.
