<paratext> [Epitaph on Sir William Williams]
<paratext>
Here, foremost in the dangerous paths of fame,
Young Williams fought for England's fair renown;
His mind each Muse, each Grace adorned his frame,
Nor Envy dared to view him with a frown.
<paratext>
At Aix uncalled his maiden sword he drew,
(There first in blood his infant glory sealed);
From fortune, pleasure, science, love, he flew,
And scorned repose when Britain took the field.
<paratext>
With eyes of flame and cool intrepid breast,
Victor he stood on Belle Isle's rocky steeps;
Ah gallant youth! this marble tells the rest,
Where melancholy Friendship bends and weeps.
