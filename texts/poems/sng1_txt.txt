<paratext> Song I
<paratext>
<paratext> 1 
<paratext>
'Midst beauty and pleasure's gay triumphs, to languish
And droop without knowing the source of my anguish;
To start from short slumbers and look for the morning&mdash;
Yet close my dull eyes when I see it returning;
<paratext>
<paratext> 2 
<paratext>
Sighs sudden and frequent, looks ever dejected,
Sounds that steal from my tongue, by no meaning connected!
Ah say, fellow-swains, how these symptoms befell me?
They smile, but reply not. Sure Delia will tell me!
