<paratext> <em>PREFACE</em>
<paratext> 
<paratext> In the eleventh century <em>Sigurd,</em> Earl of the Orkney-Islands,
<paratext> went with a fleet of ships and a considerable body of troops
<paratext> into Ireland, to the assistance of <em>Sictryg with the silken beard,</em>
<paratext> who was then making war on his father-in-law <em>Brian,</em> King of
<paratext> Dublin: the Earl and all his forces were cut to pieces, and
<paratext> <em>Sictryg</em> was in danger of a total defeat; but the enemy had a 
<paratext> greater loss by the death of <em>Brian,</em> their King, who fell in
<paratext> the action. On Christmas-day, (the day of the battle,) a native 
<paratext> of <em>Caithness</em> in Scotland saw at a distance a number of persons 
<paratext> on horseback riding full speed towards a hill, and seeming to enter 
<paratext> into it. Curiosity led him to follow them, till looking through an
<paratext> opening in the rocks he saw twelve gigantic figures resembling 
<paratext> women: they were all employed about a loom; and as they wove, 
<paratext> they sung the following dreadful Song; which when they had 
<paratext> finished, they tore the web into twelve pieces, and (each taking
<paratext> her portion) galloped six to the north and as many to the south.
<paratext> 
<paratext> 
Now the storm begins to lower, 
(Haste, the loom of hell prepare,) 
Iron-sleet of arrowy shower 
Hurtles in the darkened air. 
<paratext>
Glittering lances are the loom, 
Where the dusky warp we strain, 
Weaving many a soldier's doom, 
Orkney's woe, and Randver's bane. 
<paratext>
See the grisly texture grow, 
('Tis of human entrails made,) 
And the weights that play below, 
Each a gasping warrior's head. 
<paratext>
Shafts for shuttles, dipped in gore, 
Shoot the trembling cords along. 
Sword, that once a monarch bore, 
Keep the tissue close and strong. 
<paratext>
Mista black, terrific maid, 
Sangrida and Hilda see, 
Join the wayward work to aid: 
'Tis the woof of victory. 
<paratext>
Ere the ruddy sun be set, 
Pikes must shiver, javelins sing, 
Blade with clattering buckler meet, 
Hauberk crash and helmet ring. 
<paratext>
(Weave the crimson web of war) 
Let us go, and let us fly, 
Where our friends the conflict share, 
Where they triumph, where they die. 
<paratext>
As the paths of fate we tread, 
Wading through the ensanguined field: 
Gondula and Geira, spread 
O'er the youthful King your shield. 
<paratext>
We the reins to slaughter give, 
Ours to kill and ours to spare: 
Spite of danger he shall live. 
(Weave the crimson web of war.) 
<paratext>
They, whom once the desert-beach 
Pent within its bleak domain, 
Soon their ample sway shall stretch 
O'er the plenty of the plain. 
<paratext>
Low the dauntless Earl is laid, 
Gored with many a gaping wound: 
Fate demands a nobler head; 
Soon a King shall bite the ground. 
<paratext>
Long his loss shall Eirin weep, 
Ne'er again his likeness see; 
Long her strains in sorrow steep, 
Strains of immortality! 
<paratext>
Horror covers all the heath, 
Clouds of carnage blot the sun. 
Sisters, weave the web of death; 
Sisters, cease, the work is done. 
<paratext>
Hail the task, and hail the hands! 
Songs of joy and triumph sing! 
Joy to the victorious bands; 
Triumph to the younger King. 
<paratext>
Mortal, thou that hear'st the tale, 
Learn the tenor of our song. 
Scotland, through each winding vale 
Far and wide the notes prolong. 
<paratext>
Sisters, hence with spurs of speed: 
Each her thundering faulchion wield; 
Each bestride her sable steed. 
Hurry, hurry to the field. 
<atnt1> <em>Note</em> &mdash; The <em>Valkyriur</em> were female Divinities, Servants of <em>Odin</em> 
<atnt1> (or <em>Woden</em>) in the Gothic mythology. Their name signifies <em>Chusers of the slain</em>. 
<atnt1> They were mounted on swift horses, with drawn swords in their hands; and in the throng 
<atnt1> of battle selected such as were destined to slaughter, and conducted them to <em>Valhalla</em>, 
<atnt1> the hall of <em>Odin</em>, or paradise of the Brave; where they attended the banquet, 
<atnt1> and served the departed Heroes with horns of mead and ale.

<atnt3> of the warp-beam' according to Cleasby &amp; Vigfusson, <em>An Old Icelandic Dictionary</em>, 
<atnt3> s.v. <em>rifr</em>) by <em>nubes sagittarum</em>, an error which Gray incorporated 
<atnt3> into his poem.]<br>
