<paratext> [The Death of Hoel] 
<paratext>
<paratext> From Aneurin, Monarch of the Bards, 
<paratext> extracted from the Gododin
<paratext>
Had I but the torrent's might,
With headlong rage and wild affright
Upon Deira's squadrons hurled,
To rush and sweep them from the world!
<paratext>
Too, too secure in youthful pride,
By them my friend, my Hoel, died,
Great Cian's son: of Madoc old
He asked no heaps of hoarded gold;
Alone in nature's wealth arrayed,
He asked and had the lovely maid.
<paratext>
To Cattraeth's vale in glittering row
Twice two hundred warriors go;
Every warrior's manly neck
Chains of regal honour deck,
Wreathed in many a golden link:
From the golden cup they drink
Nectar, that the bees produce,
Or the grape's ecstatic juice.
Flushed with mirth and hope they burn:
But none from Cattraeth's vale return,
Save Aeron brave and Conan strong,
(Bursting through the bloody throng)
And I, the meanest of them all,
That live to weep and sing their fall.
