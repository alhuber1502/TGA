<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Thomas Gray's "Elegy Written in a Country-Churchyard" (1751) is one
  of the most widely and frequently translated/paraphrased/imitated
  poems in the English language.  With to date at least 266
  translations into at least 40 languages, the "Elegy" has inspired
  translators since the early 1760s when the earliest Latin
  translations appeared.  Since then, the poem has been influential in
  the history of many national literatures, particularly in the
  context of the development of European Romanticism.

<h4>The project</h4>

<p>The aim of the "Gray's 'Elegy' in translation"-project is to make
  it possible to trace and document the reception and impact of Gray's
  most famous poem in a number of languages and national literatures.
  Drawing on the extensive collection of "Elegy" translations compiled
  by <a target="_blank" class="external" 
  href="http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/tal.2013.0099">Tom 
  Turk</a>, the purpose of this work is firstly to enable the study
  of the evolution of translations of the poem in a single language,
  and secondly to allow for a comparative study of the translations
  across languages and literatures.  The translations variably
  highlight changes in the interpretation of the original, reflect 
  cultural borrowings and transfers, betray changes in literary taste, 
  and may allow us to uncover the circumstances, agency, and purpose
  of their production.
</p>

<h4>Current and future work</h4>

<p>In this first phase of the project we have covered the period up to
  1805, comprising 57 verse and prose translations of the
  "Elegy" in eleven languages (Danish, French, German, Italian, Latin,
  Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Welsh).  We have
  opted for this approach, because it should help to more easily
  contextualize the translations in their historical contexts, make
  them more easily comparable across languages, and avoids any
  potential copyright issues.  We plan to extend this range to the
  1830s and beyond (adding many more translations and languages) in
  future phases of the project. <em>N.B.</em> We are aware of a number
  of <a href="#lacunae" data-toggle="tab">lacunae</a> from the 
  period covered by this first installment of the project 
  that have yet to be added in full-text. The reason why the
  translations have been omitted is given in each case.

<h4>Technical note</h4>

<p>The electronic files have been created by encoding transcription
  from printed text.  The full-text of each translation is accompanied
  by a short note on prose or verse form as well as bibliographic
  information about the source edition, which can also be consulted in
  the <a href="#bibl" data-toggle="tab">bibliography</a>. All texts
  have been marked up in TEI/XML for long-term access, re-use, and
  preservation purposes.</p>
