  The aim of the "Gray's 'Elegy' in translation"-project, which ran
  from April 2017 to March 2018, was to make it possible to trace the
  reception and impact of Gray's most famous poem, the "Elegy Written in
  a Country Church-yard" (1751), in a number of languages and national
  literatures.  Drawing on the extensive collection of "Elegy"
  translations compiled by <a target="_blank" class="external" 
   href="http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/tal.2013.0099">Tom 
  Turk</a>, the purpose of this work was firstly to enable the study
  of the evolution of translations of the poem in a single language,
  and secondly to allow for a comparative study of the translations
  across languages and literatures.
</p>

<p>
  In this first phase of this project we have covered the period up to
  1805, comprising 57 verse and prose translations of the
  "Elegy" in eleven languages (Danish, French, German, Italian, Latin,
  Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Welsh).  We have
  opted for this approach, because it should help to more easily
  contextualize the translations, makes them more easily comparable
  across languages, and avoids any potential copyright issues.  We
  plan to extend this range to the 1830s and beyond (adding many more
  translations and languages) in future phases of the project.

<p>The full-text of each translation is accompanied by a set of
  bibliographical information, which can be seen in
  the <a href="#bibl" data-toggle="tab">bibliography</a> and is
  displayed at the bottom of each text column. All
  texts have been marked up in TEI/XML for long-term access, re-use,
  and preservation purposes.</p>

<h3>Help</h3>

<h4>Opening and closing texts</h4>

<p>To open a text/translation, select it from the list
  of <a href="#translations" data-toggle="tab">translations</a> on the main page.
  Alternatively, select a text from the drop-down menu in the header
  of each of the <a href="translations.shtml">text columns</a>.  To
  close a text, simply click the Ã— symbol at the top right of each
  text column.
</p>

<h4>Text alignment</h4>

<p>When hovering over any stanza or paragraph in one text, equivalent
  passages are highlighted in the other texts/translations.  If there
  is a considerable difference in text length, you can drag the
  shorter text downwards to make it easier to keep them in
  sync. All stanzas found in the translations have been supplied in
  the original at the point of their individual occurrences.
</p>

<h4>Translation and annotation</h4>

<p>To add a translation or comment on a translation of any section of
  any of the texts, click on a word/token and drag the pointer to the
  end point of the passage to be annotated.  When the button is
  released, a contribution form will appear and a translation and/or
  comment on the highlighted section can be contributed.</p>

<p>Please note that all contributions will be submitted to the editor
  for review in the first instance. Once peer-reviewed, they will
  appear as part of the Gray's "Elegy" in translation-textbase under a
