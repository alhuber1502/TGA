<h4>Two interfaces: full-text and detailed view</h4>

<p>There are two basic interfaces to explore the translations of
  Gray's "Elegy": the <em>full-text view</em> and the <em>detailed
  view</em>.  These can be selected/toggled between at the top of the
  translations comparison page.  In the <em>full-text view</em> up to
  three texts (in any combination of languages) can be explored
  side-by-side in their entirety.  In the <em>detailed view</em> any
  one stanza from a text can be compared with its "equivalents"
  (if available) in either all of the translations or the translations
  in a particular language.</p>

<h4>Full-text view</h4>

<h5>Opening and closing texts</h5>

<p>To open a text/translation, select it from the list
  of <a href="#translations" data-toggle="tab">translations</a> on the
  main page.  Alternatively, select a text from the drop-down menu in the header
  of each of the <a href="translations.shtml?texts=tgaen-welcc::">text columns</a> on the
  translations comparison page.  To  close a text, simply click the Ã— (close)
  symbol at the top right of each text column.
</p>

<h5>Text alignment</h5>

<p>When hovering over any stanza or paragraph in one text, "equivalent"
  passages are highlighted in the other texts/translations.  If there
  is a considerable difference in the lengths of the texts, you can
  drag the shorter text downwards, as you scroll, to make it easier to
  keep them in sync.  In case a translation contains a rejected stanza
  from an early edition or MS version of the "Elegy", it has been
  supplied and will be shown in the original at the point of their
  individual occurrences.
</p>

<h5>Translation and annotation</h5>

<p>You can add a translation or comment on a translation of any
  section of any of the texts.  Simply click on a word/token and drag
  the pointer to the end point of the passage to be annotated.  When
  the button is released, a contribution form will appear and a
  translation and/or comment on the highlighted section can be
  contributed.  Please make sure that rights of any kind are
  respected when including the work of third parties.</p>

<p>Please note that all contributions will be submitted to the editor
  for review in the first instance.  Once peer-reviewed, they will
  appear as part of the Gray's "Elegy" in translation-textbase under a  
  <a rel="license" target="_blank" class="external"
  href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative
  Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License</a>.  This
  license protects your contributions, but at the same time lets
  others re-use and build upon them.

<h4>Detailed view</h4>

<h5>Selecting a stanza</h5>

<p>Switch to the <em>detailed view</em> by selecting it from the top of
  the translations comparison page.  You can now select any of the
  stanzas in the text displayed in the left column and simply click on
  it.  This will hide all other stanzas and will let you focus in
  detail on your selection.  You can restore the full-text of the text
  and choose a different stanza by returning to the full-text view.
</p>

<h5>Selecting a language</h5>

<p>By default, the "equivalents" of the selected stanza will be
  displayed in all other translations.  You can narrow the selection to
  a language of your choice in the dropdown-menu at the top.  As the
  list of translations grows for all languages, this comparison
  feature will come into its own.
</p>

<h5>From detail to context</h5>

<p>You can "zoom" back out of the detailed view to a comparison of the 
  entire text by selecting the full-text view at the top of the 
  translations comparison page.  You can pre-load the texts you want 
  to compare by choosing the option to load a text into one of the
  columns offered with any text segment displayed in the detailed view.
  After you have preloaded the desired texts, simply switch back to the
  full-text view to resume your analysis of the selected texts.
