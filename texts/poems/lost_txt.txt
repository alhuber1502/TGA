<paratext> A Long Story
<paratext>
In Britain's isle, no matter where, 
An ancient pile of building stands: 
The Huntingdons and Hattons there 
Employed the power of fairy hands 
<paratext>
To raise the ceiling's fretted height, 
Each panel in achievements clothing, 
Rich windows that exclude the light, 
And passages that lead to nothing. 
<paratext>
Full oft within the spacious walls, 
When he had fifty winters o'er him, 
My grave Lord-Keeper led the brawls; 
The Seal and Maces danced before him. 
<paratext>
His bushy beard and shoe-strings green, 
His high-crowned hat and satin-doublet, 
Moved the stout heart of England's Queen, 
Though Pope and Spaniard could not trouble it. 
<paratext>
What, in the very first beginning! 
Shame of the versifying tribe! 
Your history whither are you spinning? 
Can you do nothing but describe?
<paratext>
A house there is (and that's enough) 
From whence one fatal morning issues 
A brace of warriors, not in buff, 
But rustling in their silks and tissues. 
<paratext>
The first came cap-a-pee from France 
Her conquering destiny fulfilling, 
Whom meaner beauties eye askance, 
And vainly ape her art of killing. 
<paratext>
The other Amazon kind heaven 
Had armed with spirit, wit, and satire: 
But Cobham had the polish given, 
And tipped her arrows with good-nature. 
<paratext>
To celebrate her eyes, her air&mdash; 
Coarse panegyrics would but tease her. 
Melissa is her <em>nom de guerre.</em>
Alas, who would not wish to please her! 
<paratext>
With bonnet blue and capucine, 
And aprons long they hid their armour, 
And veiled their weapons bright and keen 
In pity to the country-farmer. 
<paratext>
Fame in the shape of Mr. P[ur]t 
(By this time all the parish know it) 
Had told that thereabouts there lurked 
A wicked imp they call a poet, 
<paratext>
Who prowled the country far and near, 
Bewitched the children of the peasants, 
Dried up the cows and lamed the deer, 
And sucked the eggs and killed the pheasants. 
<paratext>
My lady heard their joint petition, 
Swore by her coronet and ermine, 
She'd issue out her high commission 
To rid the manor of such vermin. 
<paratext>
The heroines undertook the task; 
Through lanes unknown, o'er stiles they ventured, 
Rapped at the door nor stayed to ask, 
But bounce into the parlour entered. 
<paratext>
The trembling family they daunt, 
They flirt, they sing, they laugh, they tattle, 
Rummage his mother, pinch his aunt, 
And up stairs in a whirlwind rattle. 
<paratext>
Each hole and cupboard they explore, 
Each creek and cranny of his chamber, 
Run hurry-skurry round the floor, 
And o'er the bed and tester clamber, 
<paratext>
Into the drawers and china pry, 
Papers and books, a huge imbroglio! 
Under a tea-cup he might lie, 
Or creased, like dogs-ears, in a folio. 
<paratext>
On the first marching of the troops 
The Muses, hopeless of his pardon, 
Conveyed him underneath their hoops 
To a small closet in the garden. 
<paratext>
So Rumour says (who will, believe) 
But that they left the door ajar, 
Where, safe and laughing in his sleeve, 
He heard the distant din of war. 
<paratext>
Short was his joy. He little knew 
The power of magic was no fable. 
Out of the window, whisk, they flew, 
But left a spell upon the table. 
<paratext>
The words too eager to unriddle, 
The poet felt a strange disorder: 
Transparent birdlime formed the middle, 
And chains invisible the border. 
<paratext>
So cunning was the apparatus, 
The powerful pothooks did so move him, 
That, will he, nill he, to the Great-House 
He went, as if the Devil drove him. 
<paratext>
Yet no his way (no sign of grace, 
For folks in fear are apt to pray) 
To Phoebus he preferred his case, 
And begged his aid that dreadful day. 
<paratext>
The godhead would have backed his quarrel, 
But, with a blush on recollection, 
Owned that his quiver and his laurel 
'Gainst four such eyes were no protection. 
<paratext>
The court was sate, the culprit there, 
Forth from their gloomy mansions creeping 
The Lady Janes and Joans repair, 
And from the gallery stand peeping: 
<paratext>
Such as in silence of the night 
Come (sweep) along some winding entry 
(Styack has often seen the sight) 
Or at the chapel-door stand sentry; 
<paratext>
In peaked hoods and mantles tarnished, 
Sour visages, enough to scare ye, 
High dames of honour once, that garnished 
The drawing-room of fierce Queen Mary! 
<paratext>
The peeress comes. The audience stare, 
And doff their hats with due submission: 
She curtsies, as she takes her chair, 
To all the people of condition. 
<paratext>
The bard with many an artful fib 
Had in imagination fenced him, 
Disproved the arguments of Squib, 
And all that Groom could urge against him. 
<paratext>
But soon his rhetoric forsook him, 
When he the solemn hall had seen; 
A sudden fit of ague shook him, 
He stood as mute as poor Macleane. 
<paratext>
Yet something he was heard to mutter, 
'How in the park beneath an old-tree 
'(Without design to hurt the butter, 
'Or any malice to the poultry,) 
<paratext>
'He once or twice had penned a sonnet; 
'Yet hoped that he might save his bacon: 
'Numbers would give their oaths upon it, 
'He ne'er was for a conjurer taken.' 
<paratext>
The ghostly prudes with hagged face 
Already had condemned the sinner. 
My lady rose and with a grace&mdash;
She smiled, and bid him come to dinner. 
<paratext>
'Jesu-Maria! Madam Bridget, 
'Why, what can the Viscountess mean?' 
(Cried the square hoods in woeful fidget) 
'The times are altered quite and clean! 
<paratext>
'Decorum's turned to mere civility; 
'Her air and all her manners show it. 
'Commend me to her affability! 
'Speak to a commoner and poet!'  
<paratext>
<paratext> <em>(Here 500 Stanzas are lost.)</em> 
<paratext>
And so God save our noble King, 
And guard us from long-winded lubbers, 
That to eternity would sing, 
And keep my lady from her rubbers.
