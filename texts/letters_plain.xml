				<p>This section of the Thomas Gray Archive contains detailed bibliographic records for all known original, copied, or published letters
					written by or to the poet. Each record is accompanied by digitised images of the manuscript, where available, or digitised images of a
					printed edition, as well as the full-text.</p>
				<p>The majority of the letters survive in autograph MSS or (near) contemporary transcripts. There are only 133 letters for which no MS
					copy has yet been located. 59 letters are known to have existed, but have not survived. William Mason, who was authorized by Gray in
					his will to "preserve or destroy [Gray's papers] at his own discretion", edited many of Gray's letters for his edition of 1775, which
					for a number of letters is now the only authority. Today most of Gray's letters are preserved in libraries, archives, and museums
					around the world. A few are still privately owned.</p>
				<p>The correspondence catalogue is a standards-based and up-to-date record of Gray's known correspondence and is intended as a research
					tool for Gray scholars. It is work in progress: information on dates, contents, and contexts of the letters will be added and updated
					on a regular basis. Please see this help section for more information, and contact the editor with any queries regarding this resource,
					with information to add, or corrections to make.</p>

				<p>I believe by your not making me happy in a longer letter than that I have just received, you had a design to prevent my tireing you

					fob'd off<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.26tm" /> with eleven lines and a half? after waiting this week in continual expectation, &amp;
					proposing to myself all the pleasure, that you, if you would, might give me; Gadsbud! I am provoked into a fermentation! when I see you

					you have balked me in this manner: what an excuse do you make with your Passion-week &amp; fiddle-faddle, as if you could ever be at a
					loss what to say; why, I, that am in the country<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.28tm" /> could give you a full &amp; true account of half a
					dozen Intrigues, nay I have an amour carried on almost under my window between a boar &amp; a sow, people of very good fashion, that
					come to an assignation, and squeak like ten masquerades; I have a great mind to make you hear the whole progress of the affair,
					together with the humours of Miss Pigsnies, the lady's Confidente; but you will think perhaps I invent it, &amp; so I shall let it
					alone: but I wonder you are not ashamed of yourself; in town, and not able to furnish out an epistle as long as a Cows tail! (excuse
					the rusticity of my simile) in short, I have tryed and condemned you in my mind, all that you can alledge to save yourself won't do;

				<p>For Gods sake send me your Quære's, &amp; I'll do my best to get information upon those Points, you don't understand: I warrant, you
					imagine that People in one College, know the Customs of others; but you mistake, they are quite little Societies by themselves: ye
					Dresses, Language, Customs &amp;c are different in different Colledges: what passes for Wit in one, would not be understood if it were
					carried to another: thus the Men of Peter-house, Pembroke &amp; Clare-hall of course must be Tories; those of Trinity, Rakes; of Kings,
					Scholars; of Sidney, Wigs; of St Johns, Worthy men &amp; so on: now what to say about this Terra Incognita, I don't know; First then it
					is a great old Town, shaped like a Spider, with a nasty lump in the middle of it, &amp; half a dozen scambling long legs: it has 14
					Parishes, 12 Colledges, &amp; 4 Halls, these Halls only entertain Students, who after a term of years, are elected into the
						Colledges:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.36tm" /> there are 5 ranks in the University, subordinate to the Vice-chancellour, who is chose
					annually: these are [Masters, Fellows, Fellow-Commoners, Pensione]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.37tm" />rs, , &amp; Sizers; The Masters of
					Colledges are twelve grey-hair'd Gentlefolks, who are all mad with Pride; the Fellows are sleepy, drunken, dull, illiterate Things; the
					Fellow-Com: are imitatours of the Fellows, or else Beaux, or else nothing: the Pension: grave, formal Sots, who would be thought old;
					or else drink Ale, &amp; sing Songs against ye Excise. The Sizers are Graziers Eldest Sons, who come to get good Learning, that they
					may all be Archbishops of Canterbury: these 2 last Orders are qualified to take Scholarships; one of which, your humble Servt has had
					given him:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.38tm" /> first they led me into the hall, &amp; there I swore Allegiance to ye King; then I went to a
					room, where I took 50000 Latin Oaths, such as, to wear a Square Cap, to make 6 verses upon the Epistle or Gospel every Sunday morning,
					to chant very loud in Chappel, to wear a clean Surplice, &amp;c: &amp;c:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.39tm" /> Now as to eating: the
					Fellow-Com: dine at the Fellows Table, their Commons is worth 6s-4d a-week, the Pensioners pay but 2s-4d; if any body don't like their
					Commons, they send down into the Kitchen to know, what's for Sizing:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.40tm" /> the Cook sends up a Catalogue of
					what there is; &amp; they chuse, what they please: they are obliged to pay for Commons, whither they eat it, or no: there is always
					Plenty enough: the Sizers feast upon the leavings of the rest; as to dress, the Fell: Commoners usually wear a Prunella Gown with
					Sleeves, a hat &amp; no band; but their proper habit has its Sleeves trimmed with Gold-lace, this they only wear at publick Ceremonies;
					neither do the Noblemen use their pr: Habit commonly, but wear only a black Padesoy Gown: the Men of Kings are a sort of University by
					themselves; &amp; differ in Customs from all the rest; every body hates 'em &amp; when Almanzor<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.41tm" /> comes
					to me, our Peoples stare at him, like a Lord-mayors Show, &amp; wonder to see a human Creature among them: if I tell you, I never stirr
					out, perhaps you won't believe me; especially when you know, there's a Club of Wits kept at the Mitre, all such as come from Eton;
					where Alm: would introduce me, if I so pleased:&#x2013;yet you will not think it strange, that I don't go abroad, when I tell you, that
					I am got into a room;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.42tm" /> such [a]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.43tm2" /> hugeous one, that little i is quite
					lost in it; so [that]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.43tm1" /> when I get up in the morning, I begin to travel [tow]ards<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.43tm" /> the middle of it with might &amp; main, &amp; with much ado about noon bate at a great Table, which stands
					half-way it: so then, by that time, (after having pursued my journey full speed); that I arrive at the door, it is so dark &amp; late,
					&amp; I am so tired, that I am obliged to turn back again: so about Midnight I get to the bedside: then, thinks you, I suppose, he goes
					to sleep: hold you a bit; in this Country it is so far from that, that we go to bed to wake, &amp; rise to sleep: in short, those that
					go along the street, do nothing but walk in their sleep: they run against every Post they meet: but I beg pardon, for talking so much
					of myself, since that's not, what you care for&#x2013;(To be continued)</p>

					<p>If I should undertake to prove to you, that everything is Tobacco, it might be looked upon as an Absurdity after the revrd &amp;
						learnd Dn Swift has made it so manifest, that every thing is a Pudding:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.55tm" /> but I conceive it will not be
						so difficult to shew, that Tobacco is every thing (at least here) for there is not a soul in our Colledge (a body I should say) who
						does not smoke or chew: there's nothing but Whiffing from Fellow to Sizer; nay, even the very Chimnies, that they may'nt be thought
						partic'lar, must needs smoke, like the rest: whilst unfashionable I labour thro' clouds of it, with as much pains, as Milton's poor
						Devil took, when he travel'd through Chaos:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.56tm" />&#x2013;but, as to the Guzzling affair, you mistook in
						thinking it was the Old fellows, that were with me; no 'twas a thousand times worse; they were all young ones&#x2013;do but imagine me
						pent up in a room hired for the purpose, &amp; none of the largest, from 7 a-clock at night, till 4 in the morning! 'midst hogsheads
						of Liquor &amp; quantities of Tobacco, surrounded by 30 of these creatures, infinitely below the meanest People you could even form an

						afraid by the by, was too well-fancied, to be real) well! he was so maudlin &amp; so loving &amp; told me long Stories, interrupted by
						the sourest Interjections, with moral Discourses upon God knows what! that I was almost drunk too: oh&#x2013;I must just beg lea[ve to
							men]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.59tm" />tion one more, who, they tell me, has no fault, but that, he's a little too <hi rend="italic"
							>foppish</hi> &amp; talks like a London-Rake; this fine Gentleman is quite master of the Spectator &amp; retails it for ever; among
						the rest, he gave his humble Opinion of the present state of the Play-house; that Stevens<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.60tm" /> had a very
						graceful Motion, spoke well, &amp;c, but that he must needs give his Voice for Mr Quin;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.61tm" /> Mrs
							Thurmond<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.62tm" /> too was in great favour with him: as for the Opera's he could not understand them, but had
						heard Margaretta<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.63tm" /> &amp; Nicolini<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.64tm" /> highly commended by those, that were
						judges: by God, says another, those Opera's are the ruin of the nation; no honest people can go to 'em, &amp; those, that do, are
						ashamed of themselves; else why should they go in Masques &amp; Disguises thither&#x2013;no body in the company found out his blunder,
						so no body laugh'd but I, which was taken for applause. you'll think it a strange compliment, when I tell you how often I thought of
						you, all the while: but will forgive me, when you recollect, that 'twas a great piece of Philosophy in me, to be able, in ye midst of
						Noise &amp; Disturbance, to call to mind the most agreeable thing in nature: when you could give me so much Pleasure, absent; what
						must you do, when with me? tho' perhaps its policy in you to stay away so long, that you may increase my Desire of seeing you: in your

					with speed new Regions to explore, <lb /> And blunder'd thro' a narrow Postern door; <lb /> First most devoutly having said its
					Prayers, <lb /> It tumbled down a thousand pair of [Stairs],<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.75tm" /><lb /> Thro' Entries long, thro' Cellars
					vast &amp; deep, <lb /> Where ghostly Rats their habitations keep, <lb /> Where Spiders spread their Webs, &amp; owlish Goblins sleep.
					<lb /> After so many Chances had befell, <lb /> It came into a mead of Asphodel: <lb /> Betwixt the Confines of ye light &amp; dark
					<lb /> It lies, of 'Lyzium ye St James's park: <lb /> Here Spirit-Beaux flutter along the Mall, <lb /> And shadows in disguise scate
					o'er ye Iced Canal: <lb /> Here groves embower'd, &amp; more sequester'd Shades, <lb /> Frequented by ye Ghosts of Ancient Maids,
					<lb /> Are seen to rise: the melancholy Scene <lb /> With gloomy haunts, &amp; twilight walks between<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.76tm"
					 /><lb /> Conceals the wayward band: here spend their time <lb /> Greensickness Girls, that died in youthful prime, <lb /> Virgins
					forlorn, all drest in Willow-green-i <lb /> With Queen Elizabeth and Nicolini.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.77tm" /></p>
				<p>More to reveal, or many words to use <lb /> Would tire alike your patience &amp; my muse. <lb /> Believe, that never was so faithful
					found <lb /> Queen Proserpine to Pluto under ground, <lb /> Or Cleopatra to her Marc-Antony <lb /> As Orozmades<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.78tm" /> to his Celadony.</p>
				<p>P:S: <lb /> Lucrece for half a crown<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.79tm" /> will shew you fun,<lb /> But Mrs Oldfield<anchor

					Covent-Garden house: <lb /> Plays, which were hiss'd above, below revive; <lb /> When dead applauded, that were damn'd alive: <lb />
					The People, as in life, still keep their Passions, <lb /> But differ something from the world in Fashions. <lb /> Queen

				<p>As you take a great deal of pleasure in concluding that I am dead, &amp; resolve not to let me live any longer; methinks you ought to
					be good to my Ashes, &amp; give 'em leave to rest in peace: but instead of that, whereas I ought to be divested of all human Passions,
					&amp; forget the Pleasures of your World; you must needs be diverting me, so that I made every nail in my Coffin start with laughing:
					it happen'd, that on the 26th Instant at twelve of the clock at midnight, being a hard frost; I had wrapt myself up in my Shroud very
					snugg &amp; warm; when in comes your Letter, which (as I told you before) made me stretch my Skeleton-jaws in such a horse-laugh, that
					all the dead pop'd up their heads &amp; stared: but to see the frowzy Countenances of the Creatures especially one old Lady-Carcase,
					that made most hideous Grimaces, &amp; would needs tell me, that I was a very uncivil Person to disturb a Woman of her Quality, that
					did me the honour to lie so near me: &amp; truly she had not been in such a Surprise, this threescore &amp; ten Year, come next March:
					besides her Commode was discomposed, &amp; in her hurry she had lost her Wedding Ring, which she was buried in; nay, she said, she
					believed she should fall in fits, &amp; certainly, that would be her Death: but I gave her a Rowland for her Oliver, 'i'gad: I told her
					Ladyship the more she stirred, the more she'd stink &amp; that to my knowledge, tho' she put a good face upon the matter; she was not
					sound: so she lay'd her down very quietly, and crept under her Winding-Sheet for fear of Spirits. now your Arrival only can deliver me
					from such a state of Separation; for, as your Soul is large enough to serve for both of us, it will be ill-natured of you, if you don't
					reanimate my Corps: at least I hope for a place in your heart, as formerly: tho', by your last letter, but one; it seems, you have

				<p>After having been very piously at St Mary's church yesterday; as I was coming home; somebody told me, that you was come, &amp; that
					your Servant had been to enquire for me: whereupon throwing off all the Pruderie &amp; Reserve of a Cambridge Student, in a great
					extasie, I run in a vast hurry to set the Bells a-ringing, &amp; kindle a thousand Bonfires&#x2013;when amidst these Convulsions of
					Joy, I was stopt by one of our Colledge, who inform'd me, that a fine Gentleman in a laced hat &amp; scarlet Stockings wanted me: so,
					you may conclude, as soon as I set eyes on him, I was ready to eat him for having your Livery on; but he soon checked me by acquainting
					me 'twas not You, that was come; but&#x2013;Your Service: now undoubtedly after being so terribly bauked; one could not have lived, but
					by the help of Hartshorn, Hungary-Water,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.92tm" /> &amp; your Journal, which gives one a greater Flow of Spirits,
					than ei[ther of them.]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.93tm" /> [but, dear Celadon],<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.94tm" /> nothing gave me half so

					&amp; had Spirits enough left, to make all the hideosities you underwent agreable by describing them: &#x2013; by all that's frightful,
					I was in agonies for you, when I saw you planted at the upper end of a Table so elegantly set out; like the King of Monsters in the
					Fairy-tales: never was any one's curiosity half so much raised by a blot, as mine is by that in your Diary: 'tis so judicious a
					Scratch, so genteel a Blurr, that I shall never be easy, till I know what it conceals; no more than I shall be, till I receive the

				<p>Yesterday morning, (being the morning I set apart for lying abed till one aclock) I was waked about ten with hollowing &amp; the
					Noise of a Bagpipe at the door; so I got up, &amp; open'd the door, &amp; saw all the court full of strange appearances: at first I
					concluded 'twas you with a whole Masquerade at your heels, but upon more mature deliberation imagined it might be Amadis de Gaul come
					to set me free from this enchanted Castle with his train of conquer'd Monsters &amp; Oddities: the first, whom I took for the Knight in
					person, had his face painted after the manner of ye ancient Britains. he played melodiously on the aforenamed Instrument, &amp; had a
					Plow upon his Back; what it meant, I did not apprehend at first: he said nothing at all, but made many very significant Grimaces:
					before him &amp; on each side a Number of Folks cover'd over with Tags &amp; Points form'd themselves into a Country Dance: there
					follow'd something, which I apprehended was the beauteous Oriana,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.120tm" /> in a white Dimoty Petticoat &amp;
					Boddice; her head &amp; face were veil'd: she was supported by her two Gentlemen-ushers, &amp; seem'd to be very obstreperous, for she
					struggled &amp; kicked, &amp; snorted, &amp; fizzled: I concluded she was falling in fits, &amp; was running with my Hungary water
						Bottle:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.121tm" /> when she was so violent, that she got loose from her Attendants, &amp; run away upon all
					fours into the middle of ye Court, &amp; her hood falling off discover'd a large pair of Ears. in short, Oriana was metamorphosed into
					a very genteel Jack-ass: upon this the whole crowd set up a great Shout of, God speed the Plough. after all I was inform'd by a Negro
					Gentlewoman with a very long beard, who had a great deal to do in the Ceremony, that it was Plough-Monday,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.122tm" /> &amp; that all this was the Custom of the Country; they march in this manner thro' all the Colledges in
					Town. the Term is now begun again, &amp; I have made such a wonderful progress in Philosophy, that I begin to be quite persuaded, that
					black is white, &amp; that fire will not burn, &amp; that I ought not, either to give credit to my eyes or feeling; they tell me too,
					that I am nothing in the world, &amp; that I only fancy, I exist: do but come to me quickly &amp; one lesson of thine, my dear

				<p>I have so little to write, &amp; so much to say; that, when you really do come, you may expect for the first fortnight to do nothing,
					but hearken to my Questions; &amp; to spend the next month in answering them: nay, I assure you, I limit the time only that you may
					rest a while, to take breath; otherwise I could listen to you for the whole two years with an infinite deal of pleasure. I am forming
					the image to myself of your journey hither; I suppose you will come down Essex way, &amp; if you do, first you must cross Epping
						forest,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.156tm2" /> &amp; there you must be rob'd: then you go a long way, &amp; at last you come to Gog-magog
						hills,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.156tm" /> and then you must be overturn'd: I hope, you have not hurt yourself; but you must come at last
					to Foulmoor<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.157tm" /> fields, &amp; then you must fall Squash into a bog, pray, don't be frighted, for in about
					an hour and half you may chance to get out; now perhaps if it is not dark, you m[ay see the t]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.158tm" />op of
					King's Chappel; tho' if it should be night, it is very likely, you won't be able to see at all: however at last you get into Cambridge,
					all bemudded &amp; tired, with three wheels and a half to the coach, four horses lame, and two blind: the first thing, that appears, is
					a row of Alms-houses, &amp; presently on the right-hand you'll see a thing like two Presbyterian Meeting-houses with the backside of a
					little Church between them, &amp; here you must find out by Sympathy, that this is Peter-house, &amp; that I am but a little way off, I
					shall soon feel how near you are; then you should say&#x2013;no, no, I should say&#x2013;but I believe I shall be too much overjoy'd to

					<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I believe you saw in the newspapers that I was going to make the tour of Italy;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.188tm" /> I shall therefore
					give you some account of the places I have seen, which are not to be found in Mr. Addison, whose method I shall follow.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.189tm" /> On 9th of Octr., 1735, we set out from Lodone<note anchored="true" n="a" place="margin">London.</note> (the
					Lugdunum of the Ancients), the capital city of Lombardy, in a chariot-and-four. About 11 o'clock, we arrived at a place the Italians
					call Tempialbulo.<note anchored="true" n="b" place="margin">White-chapel.</note> Virgil seems to have prophesied of this town when he
					says&#x2013;</p>
				<q>
					<hi rend="italic">Amisit verum vetus Albula nomen.</hi><anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.190tm" />
					<p>By <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> the founder's great design was crost, And <hi rend="italic">Albula</hi> its genuine title lost.</p>
				</q>
				<p>Here are no remains of Roman antiquity but a statue of Marc Aurelius,<note anchored="true" n="c" place="margin">Statue of King
						William at a stone-cutter's.</note> which the Lombards call Guglielmo Terzo, one of their kings, and some learned men<note
						anchored="true" n="d" place="margin">See Addison, <title>Trav.</title>, p. 26.<ref target="tg1b.4fm" /></note> St. George and the
					Dragon. It is an equestrian statue, and almost equal to that of Charlemagne, at the Great Cross,<note anchored="true" n="e"
						place="margin">Statue of King Charles at Charing Cross.</note> at Lodone. The church is an old Gothic building, and reckoned the most
					ancient in Italy. Here was some time ago an altar-piece of the Lord's Supper, in which the painter having quarrelled with the
						Abbot<note anchored="true" n="f" place="margin">Dr. White Kennet, Bishop of Peter-borough.</note> of this church, represented him like
						Judas,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.191tm" /> with this epigram:&#x2013;</p>
				<q>
					<hi rend="italic">Falleris, hâc qui te pingi sub imagine credis,</hi><lb />
					<hi rend="italic">Non similis Judas est tibi&#x2013;poenituit.</hi>
					<lb />
					<lb /> Think not, vain man, thou here art represented, <lb /> Thou art not like to <hi rend="italic">Judas</hi>&#x2013;he repented. </q>
				<p>From thence we made the best of our way to a town, which in English we should call Stony-Stratford, and corresponds with the
					description which Virgil has given of it&#x2013;</p>
				<q> &#x2013; <hi rend="italic">vivo praetervehor Ostia Saxo<lb /> Stratfordi, Megarosque sinus, Tapsumque iacentem.</hi><anchor

				<p>Those that follow are little dirty towns, that seem to have been built only to be 'knocked<note anchored="true" n="g" place="margin"

				<q>
					<hi rend="italic">Antitheum, Glaucumque, Medontaque, Thersilochumque.</hi><anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.193tm" />
				</q>
				<p>The next town of note is Arc,<note anchored="true" n="h" place="margin">Bow.</note> so called from its being built in the shape of a
						bow&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">ab Eoo curvatur in Arcum.</hi> From Arc we travelled through a very pleasant country to Epino,<note
						anchored="true" n="i" place="margin">Epping.</note> whose forest is celebrated by Virgil in these lines:&#x2013;</p>

					<hi rend="italic">Sylva Epini latè dumis, atque ilice nigrâ</hi><lb />

						place="margin">Gregory, a noted highwayman. See Addison, <title>Trav.</title>, p. 1.<ref target="tg1b.10fm" /></note> Here I was met
					by a very distant and troublesome relation. My namesake hints at such an one in those lines of his&#x2013;</p>

				<p>We lay that night at Oggerell,<note anchored="true" n="k" place="margin">Hockerel.<ref target="tg1b.11fm" /></note> which is famous
					for nothing but being Horace's Oppidulo, <hi rend="italic">quod versu dicere non est.</hi><anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.198tm" />
				</p>
				<p>In our way to Parvulun,<note anchored="true" n="l" place="margin">Littlebury.</note> we saw a great castle,<note anchored="true"
						n="m" place="margin">Audley Inn, the seat of the Earl of Suffolk.</note> belonging to the Counts of Suffolcia: it is a vast pile of
					building, but quite in the old taste. Parvulun is a small village, but formerly remarkable for several miracles,<note anchored="true"
						n="n" place="margin">Winstanley's Wonders, or Tricks in Mechanics.</note> said to be performed there by a Welsh saint,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.199tm" /> who, like Jupiter, was suckled by a goat, whence they think it</p>
				<q>
					<hi rend="italic">Porrum et Caepe nefas violare.</hi> Juv.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.200tm" />
				</q>
				<p>The wonders of Parvulun are in great repute all over Lombardy. We have very bad ways from hence to Pont Ossoria,<note anchored="true"
						n="o" place="margin">Bone Bridge.</note> where are the ruins of a bridge that gives name to the town. The account they give of it is
					as follows:&#x2013;St. Bona being desirous to pass over the river, met with a man who offered to carry her over; he took her up in his
					arms, and under pretence of doing her service, was going to ravish her; but she praying to the Virgin Mary for help, the wretch fell
					into the stream and was drowned, and immediately this bridge rose out of the water for her to go over. She was so touched with this
					signal deliverance, that she would not leave the place, but continued there till her death in exercises of devotion, and was buried in
					a little chapel at the foot of the bridge, with her story at length and this epitaph&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">Hâc sita sunt fossâ Bonae
						Venerabilis ossa!</hi><note anchored="true" n="p" place="margin">Epitaph of Venerable Bede.</note>
				</p>
				<p>From Pont Ossoria we travelled by land to Nuovo Foro<note anchored="true" n="q" place="margin">New-market.</note> (the Novum Forum of
					Jockius), where are held the greatest races in all Italy. We were shown in the treasury of the Benedictines' Convent an ancient gold
					cup which cost an hundred guineas (a great sum in those days),<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.201tm" /> and given, as the friar told us that
					attended us, by a certain German Prince, he did not very well know who, but he believed his name was one King George.<note
						anchored="true" n="r" place="margin">See p. 78.</note> The inhabitants are wonderfully fond of horses, and to this day tell you most
					surprising stories of one Looby, a Boltognian. I saw a book dedicated to the head of that family, intituled <hi rend="italic">A
						Discourse on the Magnanimity of Bucephalus, and of the Duke of Boltogne's Horse Looby.</hi><note anchored="true" n="s" place="margin"
						>See p. 30.<ref target="tg1b.18fm" /> Duke of Bolton. <ref target="tg1b.19fm" /></note>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.202tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I staid here three days, and in my way to Pavia<note anchored="true" n="t" place="margin">Cambridge.</note> stopped at the Palace of
						Delfini,<note anchored="true" n="u" place="margin">Lord Godolphin's house on Gogmagog Hills.</note> which is built on the top of a
					large barren mountain, and at a distance looks like the Ark resting on Mount Ararat. This mountain is called Gog, and opposite to one
					called Magog. They are very dangerous precipices, and occasioned the famous verse &#x2013;</p>
				<q>
					<hi rend="italic">Incidit in Gogum qui vult vitare Magogon.</hi><note anchored="true" n="v" place="margin">Incidit in Scyllam qui vult
						vitare Charibdim.</note>
				</q>
				<p>I need not repeat the history of Gog and Magog, it being known to every child, and to be found at large in most books of travels. </p>
				<p>Pavia and its University are described by Mr. Addison, so I shall only mention a circumstance which I wonder escaped that learned
					gentleman. It is the name of the town, which is derived from the badness of the streets: <hi rend="italic">Pavia à non pavendo,</hi> as
						<hi rend="italic">Lucus à non lucendo.</hi>

				<p>You use me very cruelly: You have sent me but one letter since I have been at Oxford, and that too agreeable not to make me sensible

					ingratitude, and I am obliged to your goodness for softening so harsh an appellation.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.207tm" /> When you have
					seen one of my days, you have seen a whole year of my life; they go round and round like the blind horse in the mill, only he has the
					satisfaction of fancying he makes a progress, and gets some ground; my eyes are open enough to see the same dull prospect, and to know
					that having made four-and-twenty steps more, I shall be just where I was; I may, better than most people, say my life is but a span,
					were I not afraid lest you should not believe that a person so short-lived could write even so long a letter as this; in short, I
					believe I must not send you the history of my own time, till I can send you that also of the reformation.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.208tm"
					 /> However, as the most undeserving people in the world must sure have the vanity to wish somebody had a regard for them, so I need
					not wonder at my own, in being pleased that you care about me. You need not doubt, therefore, of having a first row in the front box of
					my little heart, and I believe you are not in danger of being crouded there; it is asking you to an old play, indeed, but you will be
					candid enough to excuse the whole piece for the sake of a few tolerable lines.</p>

				<p>A thousand thanks for the thousand happy New-years you sent me, &amp; which, I suppose, a thousand good-natured people have made you
					a present of, in the overflowings of their zeal:</p>
				<q> <p>&#x2013; May each revolving year <lb /> With blessings crown'd, like this, returning smile <lb /> On [ &#xa0; &#xa0; ],<anchor

				<p>I need not wish anything further, since (as I wish, what you do) to be sure you know my wishes already: Wise folks say the wise mans
					happiness is in himself; pray, are you the wise man? they tell you too, that mortal happiness is not of long continuance; heaven send,
					yours may last, till you wish for a little misery; nay! and longer still: I can't tell whither our situations are much changed, since
					this time twelvemonth; certain I am however, that there is a great alteration: I don't succeed to your diversions in town, I believe,
					&amp; yet am absent from Cambridge without regret, nay with pleasure, tho' not infinitely happier here: &#x2013;I have very little to
					tell you, as to the place, call'd London:&#x2013; Adriano<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.213tm" /> expired a few days ago, &amp; his auncient
					Predecessour Artaxerxes<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.214tm" /> succeeds him for the present, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> I think to visit to
					night: the [Town (in submissio]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.215tm" />n to your judgement) don't much admire Delane;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.216tm" /> Mrs Porter<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.217tm" /> acts in ye Albion Queens,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.218tm" /> but I
					shall stay for another Play, before I see her; neither have I much inclination for old Cibber<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.219tm" /> in Sr
					Courtly Nice,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.220tm" /> nor for young Mrs Cibber<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.221tm" /> in Voltaire's Zara,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.222tm" /> in w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> she performs the principal part for ye first time of her appearance in that
					way: I went to King Arthur<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.223tm" /> last night, which is exceeding fine; they have a new man to [suppl]<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.224tm" />y Delane's place, one Johnson,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.225tm" /> with ye finest person &amp; face in the world
					to all appearance; but as awkward, as a Button-maker;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.226tm" /> in short, if he knew how to manage his Beauties
					to advantage, I should not wonder, if all the Women run mad for him: the inchanted part of the play, is not Machinery, but actual
					magick: the second scene is a British temple enough to make one go back a thousand years, &amp; really be in ancient Britain: the Songs
					are all Church-musick, &amp; in every one of ye Chorus's Mrs Chambers<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.227tm" /> sung ye chief part, accompanied
					with</p>
				<q><p>Roarings, Squawlings &amp; Squeakations dire<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.228tm" /></p></q>
				<p>Mrs Giffard<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.229tm" /> is by way of Emmeline, &amp; should be blind, but, heaven knows! I would not wish to see
					better than she does, &amp; seems to do; for when Philidel<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.230tm" /> restores her to sight, her eyes are not at
					all better than before; she is led in at first, by a Creature, yt was more like a Devil by half, than Grimbald<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.231tm" /> himself; she took herself for Madame la Confidente, but every body else took her to be in the Circumstances
					of Damnation: when Emmeline comes to her sight, she beholds this Mrs Matilda<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.232tm" /> first, &amp; cries
					out</p>
				<q><p>Are Women all like thee? such glorious Creatures!<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.233tm" /></p></q>
				<p>which set the people into such a laugh, as lasted the whole Act: the Frost Scene is excessive fine; the first Scene of it is only a
					Cascade, that seems frozen; with the Genius of Winter asleep &amp; wrapt in furs, who upon the approach of Cupid, after much quivering,
					&amp; shaking sings the finest song in the Play: just after, the Scene opens, &amp; shows a view of arched rocks coverd with Ice &amp;
					Snow to ye end of ye Stage; between the arches are upon pedestals of Snow eight Images of old men &amp; women, that seem frozen into
					Statues, with Icicles hanging about them &amp; almost hid in frost, &amp; from ye end come Singers, viz: Mrs Chambers, &amp;c: &amp;
					Dancers all rubbing their hands &amp; chattering with cold with fur gowns &amp; worsted gloves in abundance; there are several more
					beautiful Scenes; but rather than describe 'em, I ought to beg pardon for interrupting your happiness so long, and conclude myself </p>

					word &amp; experience upon it, doing nothing is a most amusing business, &amp; yet neither Something, nor nothing give me any pleasure;
					for this little while last past, I have been playing with Statius; we yesterday had a game at Quoits together, you'll easily forgive me
					for having broke his head, as you have a little Pique to him</p>

					<p>E LIB: 6to THEBAIDOS<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.243tm" /><lb /> Then thus the King,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.244tm" /> 'whoe'er the Quoit
						can wield,<lb /> And furthest send its weight athwart the field; <lb /> Let him stand forth his brawny arm to boast.' <lb /> Swift at
						the word, from out the gazing host <lb /> Young Pterelas with strength unequal drew <lb /> Labouring the Disc, &amp; to small distance
						threw: <lb /> The Band around admire the mighty Mass, <lb /> A slipp'ry weight, &amp; form'd of polish'd Brass; <lb /> The love of
						honour bad two Youths advance, <lb /> Achaians born, to try the glorious chance; <lb /> A third arose, of Acarnania he, <lb /> Of Pisa
						one, &amp; three from Ephyre; <lb /> Nor more for now Nesimachus's Son,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.245tm" /><lb /> By Acclamations roused,
						came towring on; <lb /> Another Orb upheaved his strong right hand, <lb /> Then thus, Ye Argive flower, ye warlike band, <lb /> Who
						trust your arms shall rase the Tyrian towers, <lb /> And batter Cadmus' Walls with stony Showers, <lb /> Receive a worthier load; yon
						puny Ball <lb /> Let Youngsters toss: <lb /> He said, &amp; scornful flung th' unheeded weight <lb /> Aloof; the champions trembling
						at the sight <lb /> Prevent disgrace, the palm despair'd resign; <lb /> All, but two youths, th' enormous Orb decline, <lb /> These
						conscious Shame withheld, &amp; pride of noble line: <lb /> As bright &amp; huge the spatious circle lay <lb /> With doubled light it
						beam'd against the Day; <lb /> So glittering shews the Thracian Godheads shield, <lb /> With such a gleam affrights Pangæa's field,
						<lb /> When blazing 'gainst the Sun it shines from far, <lb /> And clash'd rebellows with the Din of war: </p>
					<p>Phlegyas the long-expected play began, <lb /> Summon'd his strength, &amp; call'd forth all the Man; <lb /> All eyes were bent on
						his experienced hand, <lb /> For oft in Pisa's sports his native land <lb /> Admired that arm, oft on Alpheus' Shore<lb /> The
						pond'rous brass in exercise he bore; <lb /> Where flow'd the widest Stream he took his stand; <lb /> Sure flew the Disc from his
						unerring hand; <lb /> Nor stop'd till it had cut the further strand: <lb /> And now in Dust the polish'd Ball he roll'd, <lb /> Then
						grasp'd its weight, elusive of his hold; <lb /> Now fitting to his gripe, &amp; nervous Arm <lb /> Suspends the crowd with expectation
						warm; <lb /> Nor tempts he yet the plain, but hurl'd upright <lb /> Emits the mass, a prelude of his might; <lb /> Firmly he plants
						each knee, &amp; o'er his head, <lb /> Collecting all his force, the circle sped; <lb /> It towers to cut the clouds; now thro' the
						Skies <lb /> Sings in its rapid way, &amp; strengthens, as it flies; <lb /> Anon with slack'ned rage comes quivering down, <lb />
						Heavy &amp; huge, &amp; cleaves the solid ground. </p>
					<p>So from th'astonish'd Stars, her nightly train, <lb /> The Sun's pale sister, drawn by magic strain, <lb /> Deserts precipitant

					<p>Third in the labours of the Disc came on, <lb /> With sturdy step and slow, Hippomedon; <lb /> Artful and strong he pois'd the
						well-known weight, <lb /> By Phlegyas warn'd, and fir'd by Mnestheus' fate, <lb /> That to avoid, and this to emulate. <lb /> His
						vigorous arm he try'd before he flung, <lb /> Brac'd all his nerves, and every sinew strung; <lb /> Then with a tempest's whirl and
						wary eye, <lb /> Pursu'd his cast, and hurl'd the orb on high; <lb /> The orb on high tenacious of its course, <lb /> True to the
						mighty arm that gave it force, <lb /> Far overleaps all bound, and joys to see <lb /> Its antient lord secure of victory. <lb /> The
						theatre's green height and woody wall <lb /> Tremble ere it precipitates its fall, <lb /> The ponderous mass sinks in the cleaving
						ground, <lb /> While vales and woods and echoing hills rebound. <lb /> As when from Ætna's smoaking summit broke, <lb /> The eyeless
						Cyclops heav'd the craggy rock; <lb /> Where Ocean frets beneath the dashing oar, <lb /> And parting surges round the vessel roar;
						<lb /> 'Twas there he aim'd the meditated harm, <lb /> And scarce Ulysses scap'd his giant arm. <lb /> A tyger's pride the victor bore
						away, <lb /> With native spots and artful labour gay, <lb /> A Shining border round the margin roll'd, <lb /> And calm'd the terrors
						of his claws in gold. </p>

					unmeaning stuff about Venus and Cupid, and Peleus and Thetis, and Zephyrs and Dryads, was never read. As for my poor little Eclogue, it
					has been condemned and beheaded by our Westminster judges; an exordium of about sixteen lines absolutely cut off, and its other limbs

				<p>You must know that I do not take degrees, and, after this term, shall have nothing more of college impertinencies to undergo, which I
					trust will be some pleasure to you, as it is a great one to me. I have endured lectures daily and hourly since I came last, supported
					by the hopes of being shortly at full liberty to give myself up to my friends and classical companions, who, poor souls! though I see
					them fallen into great contempt with most people here, yet I cannot help sticking to them, and out of a spirit of obstinacy (I think)
					love them the better for it; and indeed, what can I do else? Must I plunge into metaphysics? Alas, I cannot see in the dark; nature has
					not furnished me with the optics of a cat. Must I pore upon mathematics? Alas, I cannot see in too much light; I am no eagle. It is
					very possible that two and two make four, but I would not give four farthings to demonstrate this ever so clearly; and if these be the
					profits of life, give me the amusements of it. The people I behold all around me, it seems, know all this and more, and yet I do not
					know one of them who inspires me with any ambition of being like him. Surely it was of this place, now Cambridge, but formerly known by
					the name of Babylon, that the prophet spoke when he said, 'the wild beasts of the desert shall dwell there, and their houses shall be
					full of doleful creatures, and owls shall build there, and satyrs shall dance there;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.336tm" /> their forts and
					towers shall be a den for ever, a joy of wild asses;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.337tm" /> there shall the great owl make her nest, and lay
					and hatch and gather under her shadow;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.338tm" /> it shall be a court of dragons;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.339tm"
					 /> the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest'.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.340tm" /> You see here is a
					pretty collection of desolate animals, which is verified in this town to a tittle, and perhaps it may also allude to your habitation,
					for you know all types may be taken by abundance of handles; however, I defy your owls to match mine.</p>
				<p>If the default of your spirits and nerves be nothing but the effect of the hyp, I have no more to say. We all must submit to that
					wayward Queen<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.341tm" />; I too in no small degree own her sway,</p>
				<q>
					<p>I feel her influence while I speak her power. </p>
				</q>
				<p>But if it be a real distemper, pray take more care of your health, if not for your own at least for our sakes, and do not be so soon
					weary of this little world: I do not know what refined friendships you may have contracted in the other,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.342tm"
					 /> but pray do not be in a hurry to see your acquaintance above; among your terrestrial familiars, however, though I say it that
					should not say it, there positively is not one that has a greater esteem for you than</p>

				<p>I congratulate you on your being about to leave college,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.344tm" /> and rejoice much you carry no degrees with
					you. For I would not have had You dignified, and I not, for the world, you would have insulted me so. My eyes, such as they are, like
					yours, are neither metaphysical nor mathematical; I have, nevertheless, a great respect for your connoisseurs that way, but am always
					contented to be their humble admirer. Your collection of desolate animals<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.345tm" /> pleased me much; but Oxford,
					I can assure you, has her owls that match yours, and the prophecy has certainly a squint that way. Well, you are leaving this dismal
					land of bondage, and which way are you turning your face? Your friends, indeed, may be happy in you, but what will you do with your
					classic companions? An inn of court is as horrid a place as a college, and a moot case is as dear to gentle dulness<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.346tm" /> as a syllogism. But wherever you go, let me beg you not to throw poetry 'like a nauseous weed away': Cherish
					its sweets in your bosom, they will serve you now and then to correct the disgusting sober follies<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.347tm" /> of
					the common law, misce stultitiam consiliis brevem, dulce est desipere in loco;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.348tm" /> so said Horace to
					Virgil, those sons of Anac in poetry, and so say I to you, in this degenerate land of pigmies,</p>
				<q>
					<p>Mix with your grave designs a little pleasure, <lb /> Each day of business has its hour of leisure. </p>

				<p>In one of these hours I hope, dear sir, you will sometimes think of me, write to me, and know me yours,</p>

				<p>that is, write freely to me and openly, as I do to you, and to give you a proof of it I have sent you an elegy of Tibullus<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.350tm" /> translated. Tibullus, you must know, is my favourite elegiac poet; for his language is more elegant and his
					thoughts more natural than Ovid's. Ovid excells him only in wit, of which no poet had more in my opinion. The reason I choose so
					melancholy a kind of poesie, is because my low spirits and constant ill health (things in me not imaginary, as you surmise, but too
					real, alas! and, I fear, constitutional) 'have tuned my heart to elegies of woe'; and this likewise is the reason why I am the most
					irregular thing alive at college, for you may depend upon it I value my health above what they call discipline. As for this poor
					unlicked thing of an elegy, pray criticise it unmercifully, for I send it with that intent. Indeed your late translation of
						Statius<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.351tm" /> might have deterred me, but I know you are not more able to excell others, than you are apt
					to forgive the want of excellence, especially when it is found in the productions of</p>

				<p>I have been very ill, and am still hardly recovered. Do you remember Elegy 5th, Book the 3d, of Tibullus, Vos tenet, &amp;c. and do
					you remember a letter of Mr Pope's, in sickness, to Mr Steele? This melancholy elegy and this melancholy letter I turned into a more
					melancholy epistle of my own, during my sickness, in the way of imitation; and this I send to you and my friends at Cambridge, not to
					divert them, for it cannot, but merely to show them how sincere I was when sick: I hope my sending it to them now may convince them I
					am no less sincere, though perhaps more simple, when well. </p>
				<p>AD AMICOS.</p>
				<p>Yes, happy youths, on Camus' sedgy side, <lb /> You feel each joy that friendship can divide; <lb /> Each realm of science and of art
					explore, <lb /> And with the antient blend the modern lore. <lb /> Studious alone to learn whate'er may tend <lb /> To raise the genius
					or the heart to mend; <lb /> Now pleas'd along the cloyster'd walk you rove, <lb /> And trace the verdant mazes of the grove, <lb />
					Where social oft, and oft alone, ye chuse <lb /> To catch the zephyr and to court the muse. <lb /> Mean time at me (while all devoid of
					art <lb /> These lines give back the image of my heart) <lb /> At me the pow'r that comes or soon or late, <lb /> Or aims, or seems to
					aim, the dart of fate; <lb /> From you remote, methinks, alone I stand <lb /> Like some sad exile in a desert land; <lb /> Around no
					friends their lenient care to join <lb /> In mutual warmth, and mix their heart with mine. <lb /> Or real pains, or those which fancy
					raise, <lb /> For ever blot the sunshine of my days; <lb /> To sickness still, and still to grief a prey, <lb /> Health turns from me
					her rosy face away. </p>
				<p>Just heav'n! what sin, ere life begins to bloom, <lb /> Devotes my head untimely to the tomb; <lb /> Did e'er this hand against a
					brother's life <lb /> Drug the dire bowl or point the murd'rous knife? <lb /> Did e'er this tongue the slanderer's tale proclaim,
					<lb /> Or madly violate my Maker's name? <lb /> Did e'er this heart betray a friend or foe, <lb /> Or know a thought but all the world
					might know? <lb /> As yet just started from the lists of time, <lb /> My growing years have scarcely told their prime; <lb /> Useless,
					as yet, through life I've idly run, <lb /> No pleasures tasted, and few duties done. <lb /> Ah, who, ere autumn's mellowing suns
					appear, <lb /> Would pluck the promise of the vernal year; <lb /> Or, ere the grapes their purple hue betray, <lb /> Tear the crude
					cluster from the mourning spray. <lb /> Stern Power of Fate, whose ebon sceptre rules <lb /> The Stygian deserts and Cimmerian pools,
					<lb /> Forbear, nor rashly smite my youthful heart, <lb /> A victim yet unworthy of thy dart; <lb /> Ah, stay till age shall blast my
					withering face, <lb /> Shake in my head, and falter in my pace; <lb /> Then aim the shaft, then meditate the blow, <lb /> And to the
					dead my willing shade shall go.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.373tm" /></p>
				<p>How weak is Man to Reason's judging eye! <lb /> Born in this moment, in the next we die; <lb /> Part mortal clay, and part ethereal
					fire, <lb /> Too proud to creep, too humble to aspire. <lb /> In vain our plans of happiness we raise, <lb /> Pain is our lot, and
					patience is our praise; <lb /> Wealth, lineage, honours, conquest, or a throne, <lb /> Are what the wise would fear to call their own.
					<lb /> Health is at best a vain precarious thing, <lb /> And fair-fac'd youth is ever on the wing; <lb /> 'Tis like the stream, beside
					whose wat'ry bed <lb /> Some blooming plant exalts his flowry head, <lb /> Nurs'd by the wave the spreading branches rise, <lb /> Shade
					all the ground and flourish to the skies; <lb /> The waves the while beneath in secret flow, <lb /> And undermine the hollow bank
					below; <lb /> Wide and more wide the waters urge their way, <lb /> Bare all the roots and on their fibres prey. <lb /> Too late the
					plant bewails his foolish pride, <lb /> And sinks, untimely, in the whelming tide.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.374tm" /></p>
				<p>But why repine, does life deserve my sigh? <lb /> Few will lament my loss whene'er I die. <lb /> For those the wretches I despise or
					hate, <lb /> I neither envy nor regard their fate.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.375tm" /><lb /> For me, whene'er all-conquering Death shall
					spread <lb /> His wings around my unrepining head, <lb /> I care not; though this face be seen no more, <lb /> The world will pass as
					chearful as before, <lb /> Bright as before the day-star will appear, <lb /> The fields as verdant, and the skies as clear;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.376tm" /><lb /> Nor storms nor comets will my doom declare, <lb /> Nor signs on earth, nor portents in the air; <lb />
					Unknown and silent will depart my breath, <lb /> Nor Nature e'er take notice of my death. <lb /> Yet some there are (ere spent my vital
						days)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.377tm" /><lb /> Within whose breasts my tomb I wish to raise. <lb /> Lov'd in my life, lamented in my
					end, <lb /> Their praise would crown me as their precepts mend: <lb /> To them may these fond lines my name endear, <lb /> Not from the
					Poet but the Friend sincere.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.378tm" /></p>

				<p>I was just going to write to you in opposition to a couple of very weighty reasons; one, that you did not bid me, &amp; t'other, that
					I had nothing to say; but, alas! what are reasons against one's inclinations, for you know in such a case a feather at any time will
					weigh down Lead; but you by instinct knowing my situation, were so good as to supply me with the cause, tho' not with materials: if you
					never were to tell me any fresher piece of News, than that with which you end your little Modicum, I should be well enough content, for
					tho' I heard it every day I should wonder as much as ever, &amp; it would never be the less agreable for repetition; I rely wholly upon
					you, my correspondent, for the truth of it, as the only person, who can tell, what passes in that little country, where my concerns
					lie. my Motions at present (which you ask after the particulars of) are much like those of a Pendulum, or (Dr Longically<anchor

					strange incidents that happen in my journeys &amp; returns I shall be sure to acquaint you with; the most wonderful that I have been
					able to pick up, as yet, is, that it rains exceedingly; this has refresh'd the prospect<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.382tm" /> very
					agreeably, as the way for the most part lies between green fields on either hand, terminated with buildings at some distance; Seats, I
					presume; &amp; they seem of great antiquity: the roads are very good, being, as I suspect, the work of Julius Cæsar's army, for they
					still preserve in many places the appearances of a pavement in pretty good repair, &amp; if they were not so near home, might perhaps
					be as much admired as the Via Appia, that we hear so much cried up: there are at present several rivulets to be crossed, &amp; which
					serve to enliven the view all round; the country is exceeding fruitful in Ravens, &amp; such black Cattle.<anchor

				<p>After a month's expectation of you, and a fortnight's despair, at Cambridge, I am come to town, and to better hopes of seeing you. If
					what you sent me last<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.389tm" /> be the product of your melancholy, what may I not expect from your more cheerful
					hours? For by this time the ill health that you complain of is (I hope) quite departed; though, if I were self-interested, I ought to
					wish for the continuance of any thing that could be the occasion of so much pleasure to me. Low spirits are my true and faithful
					companions; they get up with me, go to bed with me, make journeys and returns as I do;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.390tm" /> nay, and pay
					visits, and will even affect to be jocose, and force a feeble laugh with me; but most commonly we sit alone together, and are the
					prettiest insipid company in the world. However, when you come, I believe they must undergo the fate of all humble companions, and be
					discarded. Would I could turn them to the same use that you have done, and make an Apollo of them. If they could write such verses with
					me, not hartshorn, nor spirit of amber,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.391tm" /> nor all that furnishes the closet of an apothecary's widow,
					should persuade me to part with them: But, while I write to you, I hear the bad news of Lady Walpole's death on Saturday night

				<p>We were all here in mighty consternation this morning in imagination that the Queen was dead, not out of a joke, as she died you know

					uneasy. The slight shadow of you which I had in town,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.414tm" /> has only served to endear you to me the more.
					The moments I past with you made a strong impression upon me. I singled you out for a friend, and I would have you know me to be yours,
					if you deem me worthy. &#x2013;Alas, Gray, you cannot imagine how miserably my time passes away. My health and nerves and spirits are,
					thank my stars, the very worst, I think, in Oxford. Four-and-twenty hours of pure unalloy'd health together, are as unknown to me as
					the 400,000 characters in the Chinese vocabulary. One of my complaints has of late been so over-civil as to visit me regularly once a

				<p>The moving piece of ancient poetry you favour'd me with the sight of, would be sufficient, I must confess to deterr me, if I had any
					ambition of appearing among the Consolatores,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.450tm" />= from all pretence to writing at this time; so long as
					the sad Catastrophe of the beautiful &amp; never-to be enough-lamented Gillian<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.451tm" /> dwells upon my memory:
					those Genius's, my friend, those mighty spirits of antiquity! alas, what are we to 'em? mere tinsel! mere flash! and indeed (not to
					dwell upon the moral, so feelingly inculcated in this little elegiacal narration, which 'tis impossible should escape the acuteness of
					your penetration) what can be beyond the elegant simplicity of the language? in the exordium the poet lays down the groundwork, &amp;
					foundation, as it were, of that beautiful fabrick he intends to erect; he does not injudiciously draw his inferences, after he has
					recounted the story; at least he does not expatiate much in the end; no! he leaves the mind then to ruminate at its own leisure, &amp;
					make its own applications, when it shall have recover'd itself from that sorrow, which every virtuous mind must feel after so woful a
					tale: he recommends to the ladies of his time a strict observance of honour &amp; chastity, who, I doubt not, received his advice with
					reverence (our modern Females would perhaps [have laug]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.452tm" />'d at his gravity) he also solemnly affirms the
					truth of it, as well knowing the prevalence of truth over the mind; from whence his deep insight into Nature is sufficiently evidenced:
					at the beginning of his narration, he fixes the place of his Heroine's habitation in Surry;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.453tm" /> he had
					undoubtedly observed in Homer, &amp; the imitators of that poet; how much we are ingaged in the interest of any person, who has the

				<p>'tis true, he has not carried it quite so far as Homer in telling us, whether Gillian loved hunting or not, nor whether her father's

				<p>It seems you have forgot the poor little tenement in which you so long lodg'd, and have set your heart on some fine Castle in the
					air: I wish I were Master of the Seat you describe, that I might make your Residence more agreeable; but as it is, I fear you'll hardly
					meet with common Conveniences. </p>
				<p>I deserve you should be angry with me for haveing been so little punctual, in paying my Dues, &amp; returning thanks for your advice
					some time since. All is at present, mighty well, that is, just as you remember it, &amp; imagin'd it would be: cool enough not to burn,
					and warm enough not to freeze one, but methinks the Counsel you gave me, was what you did not think proper to make use of in like
					Circumstances yourself; perhaps you know why the same way of acting should be improper for you, &amp; proper for me: I don't doubt but
					you have your reasons, &amp; I trust you would not have me do anything wrong. </p>
				<p>The account W: gives me of your way of Life<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.518tm" /> is better than I expected: to be sure you must meet
					daily with little particulars enough to fill a letter, and I should be pleasd with the most minute. Has Mrs L:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.519tm" /> a pimple upon her Nose? does her Woman love Citron Water?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.520tm" /> &amp;c: any of
					these would be a high regale for me. but perhaps you think it telling tales: you know best. Have you seen Madame Valmote?<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.521tm" /> naughty Woman! was you at the Christening?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.522tm" /> is the Princess<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.523tm" /> with Child again? was you at the review? have you wrote e'er a Critique on the Accidence? is
						Despauterius<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.524tm" /> or Linacer<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.525tm" /> most in your favor? but perhaps you think
					this, tittle-tattle. Well! you know best. Pot-fair<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.526tm" /> is at its height; there's old raffleing. Walpole is
					gone to Stamford, &amp; to Lynn, but returns in a day or two. I am gone to the Carrier's with this letter, and am</p>

				<p>I am coming away all so fast, and leaving behind me, without the least remorse, all the beauties of Sturbridge Fair.<anchor

				<p>As I know you are a lover of Curiosities, I send you the following, which is a true &amp; faithful Narrative of what passed in my
					Study on Saturday the 16th, instant.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.554tm" /> I was sitting there very tranquil in my chair, when I was
					suddenly alarmd with a great hubbub of Tongues. In the street, you suppose? No! in my Study, Sir. In your Study say you? Yes &amp;
					between my books, which is more. For why should not books talk as well as Crabs &amp; Mice &amp; files &amp; Serpents do in Esop. But
					as I listend with great attention so as to remember what I heard pretty exactly, I shall set down the whole conversation as
					methodically as I can, with the names prefixd.</p>
				<p>Mad: Sevigné. . Mon cher Aristote! do get a little farther or you'll quite suffocate me. </p>
				<p>Aristotle. . <hi rend="italic">Οὐδέποτε</hi>
					<hi rend="italic">γυνὴ</hi> &amp;=unk; .. I have as much right to be here as you, and I shan't remove a jot.</p>
				<p>M. Sevigné. . Oh! the brute! here's my poor Sixth tome<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.555tm" /> is squeezed to death: for God's sake,
						Bussy,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.556tm" /> come &amp; rescue me.</p>
				<p>Bussy Rabutin. . Ma belle Cousine! I would fly to your assistance. Mais voici un Diable de Strabon qui me tue: I have nobody in my
					neighbourhood worth conversing with here but Catullus. </p>
				<p>Bruyere.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.557tm" /> . Patience! You must consider we are but books &amp; so can't help ourselves. for my part,
					I wonder who we all belong to. We are a strange mixture here. I have a Malebranche<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.558tm" /> on one Side of me,
					and a Gronovius<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.559tm" /> on t'other.</p>
				<p>Locke.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.560tm" /> . Certainly our owner must have very confusd ideas, to jumble us so strangely together. he
					has associated me with Ovid &amp; Ray the Naturalist.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.561tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Virgil. . 'Me vero primum dulces ante omnia Musæ Accipiant!'<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.562tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Hen: More.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.563tm" /> . Of all the Speculations that the Soul of Man can entertain herself withall; there is
					none of greater Moment than this of her immortality.</p>
				<p>Cheyne.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.564tm" /> . Every Man after fourty is a fool or a Physician.</p>
				<p>Euclid. . Punctum est, cujus nulla est &#x2013; </p>
				<p>Boileau. . Peste soit de cet homme avec son Punctum! I wonder any Man of Sense will have a Mathematician in his Study. </p>
				<p>Swift. . In short let us get the Mathematicians banishd first; the Metaphysicians and Natural Philosophers may follow them. &amp;c. </p>
				<p>Vade Mecum. . Pshaw! I and the Bible are enough for any one's library. </p>
				<p>This last ridiculous Egotism made me laugh so heartily that I disturbd my poor books &amp; they talk'd no more. </p>

					<p>IMITATION OF HORACE. Lib: I: Ep: 2: </p>
					<p>Trojani belli scriptorem, &amp;c:</p>
					<p>While haply You (or haply not at all) <lb /> Hear the grave Pleadings in the Lawyer's Hall<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.567tm" /><lb />
						Or, while You haply Littleton<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.568tm" /> explore,<lb /> Turning the learned leaden Pages o'er; <lb /> Think me
						again transported to peruse <lb /> The golden Rhapsodies of Milton's Muse: <lb /> Who shews us in his high Seraphic Song, <lb /> What
						just, what unjust, what is Right, what Wrong, <lb /> With Sense at least, &amp; Evidence as true, <lb /> As all our Judges of the
						Bench could do. <lb /> Why thus I think (to Hardwick<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.569tm" /> no Offence)<lb /> Give Ear, &amp; with your
							Coke<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.570tm" /> awhile dispense.</p>
					<p> The Tale disastrous<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.571tm" /> You remember well,<lb /> How Satan tempted, &amp; how Adam fell; <lb /> And
						how He tasted the forbidden Tree, <lb /> Seduced by female Curiosity; <lb /> How thus our Paradise we lost, &amp; all <lb /> The
						Children perish'd in the Father's Fall. <lb /> Nor be that other Tale<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.572tm" /> forgotten here<lb /> More
						moral, tho' less pleasing to the Ear <lb /> How in the Desart Wild with Hunger spent <lb /> Full forty Days our patient Saviour went.
						<lb /> Then spurning back to Hell the wily Fiend <lb /> Taught us on Heaven (Heaven only) to depend, <lb /> Hence us redeem'd at our
						Messiah's cost: <lb /> The Cross regaining, what the Apple lost. <lb /> Thus, while I read our Epic Bard divine, <lb /> My Mind intent
						with Pleasure Use to joyn, <lb /> From either Poem this Instruction draws, <lb /> To trust in God, &amp; to obey God's Laws. </p>
					<p> Enough of Sermon: I perceive, you nodd. <lb /> You think me mighty wise, &amp; mighty odd: <lb /> Your Lips, I see, half verge upon
						a Smile&#x2013; <lb /> Dear Sir, observe the Horace in my Style. <lb /> Just such to Lollius,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.573tm" /> his
						misguided Friend,<lb /> He knew with decent Liberty to send <lb /> Beneath the Critique dext'rous to convey <lb /> Advice conceal'd,
						in the best-natured Way <lb /> But You're no Lollius, and no Horace I: <lb /> Here is no Room sage Maxims to apply. <lb /> Would you
						not burst outright to hear me say <lb /> Satan, my friend, may lead the best astray; <lb /> By Nature ill, by Habit worse inclined,
						<lb /> Add Pride, add Envy, add the willful Mind <lb /> Still prone to disobey &amp; to deceive, <lb /> All men are Adam, &amp; all
						women Eve. <lb /> Thus bad, thus all corrupted, much I fear, <lb /> Morality sounds painful to the Ear. </p>
					<p> The Dogs of Night, that murder &amp; that steal, <lb /> Outwatch<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.574tm" /> the Watchmen of the publick
						Weal:<lb /> Fools, that We are! less Labour to employ <lb /> To save ourselves, than Villains to destroy. <lb /> Suppose your Body
						sick; at any Price <lb /> You run to Mead<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.575tm" /> or Hollings<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.576tm" /> for
						Advice:<lb /> This for thy Body: but suppose thy Mind, <lb /> For that what Mead or Hollings will you find? <lb /> Rise, Sluggard,
						rise, &amp; quit thy Morning-Bed <lb /> E're yet Aurora lifts her rosy Head: <lb /> Take Plato down, take Tully, take Bruyére,<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg1a.577tm" /><lb /> Make honest Things, &amp; Studies all thy Care: <lb /> At sight of Industry Vice flies away, <lb />
						As Spectres vanish at the Face of Day. <lb /> If ought offensive to the Eye appear <lb /> Not long You let the Object be too near:
						<lb /> What hurts the Mind more patient to endure, <lb /> For Years together we delay the Cure. <lb /> Meanwhile the Time irrevocable
						flies: <lb /> Begin, &amp; have the Spirit to be wise: <lb /> Begin, nor do, as did the Rustick Ass<lb /> Who stood, &amp; waited till
						the Stream should pass: <lb /> The Stream, Poor fool! You little seem to know, <lb /> Flows, as it flow'd, and will for ever flow.
						<lb /> The gay Town-house, the pleasant Country-Seat, <lb /> The fertile Meadow, &amp; the Garden neat, <lb /> The fruitful Nursery,
						the tender Wife, <lb /> Are Joys Men almost value with their Life: <lb /> Yet all these Joys, and more (could more be sent) <lb />
						Make not the Total of one Word, Content. <lb /> Not all the Gold of the Peruvian Mine, <lb /> Not all the Gems that blaze beneath the
						Line, <lb /> Can cure a Fever, or one Care expell: <lb /> Possessions make not the Possessour well. <lb /> The Man, who lives in Hope,
						or lives in Fear, <lb /> In nougt He has can tast the Joy sincere: <lb /> Sooner shall Handel give the Deaf delight, <lb /> And
						Rafael's Pencil charm the Blind to Sight. <lb /> First cleanse the Vessel, e're the Wine you pour; <lb /> T'will else be Vinegar,
						&amp; Wine no more. <lb /> Obvious to Sense the Allegory lies: <lb /> Would you be happy, be but only wise. <lb /> Reject all
						Pleasures of the Sense: they're vain. <lb /> Each Hour of Pleasure has it's Hour of Pain. <lb /> Bound thy mad Wishes; fix on
						something sure: <lb /> The Harpy Avarice is ever poor. <lb /> May none but Vilain's, be with Envy curst! <lb /> Of all the Vices 'tis
						the Vice the worst: <lb /> Scarce all the Tortures of the Damn'd in Hell <lb /> The Pangs of wretched Envy can excell. <lb /> Sore
						shall He smart &amp; most severely pay, <lb /> Who lets his Passion o'er his Reason sway: <lb /> Oft, to his Scorn, shall his
						unguarded Rage <lb /> Act o'er the Part of Cassius on the Stage <lb /> Reprove his Friend, upbraid, insult, resent, <lb /> Rave like
						one wild, grow sorry, &amp; repent.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.578tm" /><lb /> Oh, if you'd live in gentle Peace with all <lb /> Restrain
						the boiling Fury of thy Gall: <lb /> Oh! early wise it's growing force restrain; <lb /> Like the Steed, curb it: like the Lyon, chain. </p>

				<p>As we made but a very short journey to-day, and came to our inn early, I sit down to give you some account of our expedition. On the
					29th (according to the style here)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.581tm" /> we left Dover at twelve at noon, and with a pretty brisk gale,
					which pleased everybody mighty well, except myself who was extremely sick the whole time; we reached Calais by five: The weather
					changed, and it began to snow hard the minute we came into the harbour, where we took the boat, and soon landed. Calais is an exceeding
					old, but very pretty town, and we hardly saw any thing there that was not so new and so different from England, that it surprized us
					agreeably. We went the next morning to the great Church, and were at high Mass (it being Easter Monday). We saw also the Convent of the
					Capuchins, and the Nuns of St. Dominic; with these last we held much conversation, especially with an English Nun, a Mrs. Davis, of
					whose work I sent you, by the return of the Pacquet, a letter-case to remember her by. In the afternoon we took a Post-chaise (it still
					snowing very hard) for Boulogne, which was only eighteen miles further. This chaise is a strange sort of conveyance, of much greater
					use than beauty, resembling an ill-shaped chariot, only with the door opening before instead of the side; three horses draw it, one
					between the shafts, and the other two on each side, on one of which the postillion rides, and drives too:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.582tm"
					 /> This vehicle will, upon occasion, go fourscore miles a-day, but Mr. Walpole, being in no hurry, chooses to make easy journeys of
					it, and they are easy ones indeed; for the motion is much like that of a sedan, we go about six miles an hour, and commonly change
					horses at the end of it: It is true they are no very graceful steeds, but they go well, and through roads which they say are bad for
					France, but to me they seem gravel walks and bowling-greens; in short it would be the finest travelling in the world, were it not for
					the inns, which are mostly terrible places indeed. But to describe our progress somewhat more regularly, we came into Boulogne when it
					was almost dark, and went out pretty early on Tuesday morning; so that all I can say about it is, that it is a large, old, fortified
					town, with more English in it than French. On Tuesday we were to go to Abbéville, seventeen leagues, or fifty-one short English miles;
					but by the way we dined at Montreuil, much to our hearts' content, on stinking mutton cutlets, addle eggs, and ditch water. Madame the
					hostess made her appearance in long lappets of bone lace and a sack of linsey-woolsey. We supped and lodged pretty well at Abbéville,
					and had time to see a little of it before we came out this morning. There are seventeen convents in it, out of which we saw the chapels
					of the Minims and the Carmelite Nuns. We are now come further thirty miles to Amiens, the chief city of the province of Picardy. We
					have seen the cathedral, which is just what that of Canterbury must have been before the reformation. It is about the same size, a huge
					Gothic building, beset on the outside with thousands of small statues, and within adorned with beautiful painted windows, and a vast
					number of chapels dressed out in all their finery of altar-pieces, embroidery, gilding, and marble. Over the high altar is preserved,
					in a very large wrought shrine of massy gold, the reliques of St. Firmin, their patron saint. We went also to the chapels of the
					Jesuits and Ursuline Nuns, the latter of which is very richly adorned. To-morrow we shall lie at Clermont, and next day reach Paris.
					The country we have passed through hitherto has been flat, open, but agreeably diversified with villages, fields well-cultivated, and
					little rivers. On every hillock is a wind-mill, a crucifix, or a Virgin Mary dressed in Flowers, and a sarcenet robe; one sees
						[not]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.583tm" /> many people or carriages on the road; now and then indeed you meet a strolling friar, a
					country-man with his great muff, or a woman riding astride on a little ass, with short petticoats, and a great head-dress of blue wool.

				<p>Enfin donc me voici à Paris.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.585tm" /> Mr. Walpole is gone out to supper at Lord Conway's,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.586tm" /> and here I remain alone, though invited too. Do not think I make a merit of writing to you preferably to a
					good supper; for these [eight]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.587tm" /> days we have been here, have actually given me an aversion to eating in
					general. If hunger be the best sauce to meat, the French are certainly the worst cooks in the world; for what tables we have seen have
					been so delicately served, and so profusely, that, after rising from one of them, one imagines it impossible ever to eat again. And
					now, if I tell you all I have in my head, you will believe me mad, mais n'importe, courage, allons! for if I wait till my head grow
					clear and settle a little, you may stay long enough for a letter. Six days have we been coming hither, which other people do in two;
					they have not been disagreeable ones; through a fine, open country, admirable roads, and in an easy conveyance; the inns not absolutely
					intolerable, and images quite unusual presenting themselves on all hands. At Amiens we saw the fine cathedral, and eat paté de perdrix;
					passed through the park of Chantilly by the Duke of Bourbon's palace, which we only beheld as we passed; broke down at Lusarche; stopt
					at St. Denis, saw all the beautiful monuments of the Kings of France, and the vast treasures of the abbey, rubies, and emeralds as big
					as small eggs, crucifixes, and vows, crowns and reliquaries, of inestimable value; but of all their curiosities the thing the most to
					our tastes, and which they indeed do the justice to esteem the glory of their collection, was a vase of an entire onyx, measuring at
					least five inches over, three deep, and of great thickness. It is at least two thousand years old, the beauty of the stone and
					sculpture upon it (representing the mysteries of Bacchus) beyond expression admirable; we have dreamed of it ever since. The jolly old
					Benedictine, that showed us the treasures, had in his youth been ten years a soldier; he laughed at all the reliques, was very full of
					stories, and mighty obliging. On Saturday evening we got to Paris, and were driving through the streets a long while before we knew
					where we were. The minute we came, voila Milors Holdernesse,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.588tm" /> Conway, and his brother;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.589tm" /> all stayed supper, and till two o'clock in the morning, for here nobody ever sleeps; it is not the way: Next
					day go to dine at my Lord Holdernesse's, there was the Abbé Prevôt,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.590tm" /> author of the Cleveland,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.591tm" /> and several other pieces much esteemed: The rest were English. At night we went to the Pandore; a spectácle
					literally, for it is nothing but a beautiful piece of machinery of three scenes. The first represents the chaos, and by degrees the
					separation of the elements. The second, the temple of Jupiter, and the giving of the box to Pandora. The third, the opening of the box,
					and all the mischiefs that ensued. An absurd design, but executed in the highest perfection, and that in one of the finest theatres in
					the world; it is the grande sale des machines in the Palais des Tuileries. Next day dined at Lord Waldegrave's;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.592tm" /> then to the opera.</p>
				<p>Imagine to yourself for the drama four acts<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.593tm" /> entirely unconnected with each other, each founded on
					some little history, skilfully taken out of an ancient author, e.g. Ovid's Metamorphoses, &amp;c., and with great address converted
					into a French piece of gallantry. For instance, that which I saw, called the Ballet de la Paix, had its first act built upon the story
					of Nereus.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.594tm" /> Homer having said he was the handsomest man of his time,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.595tm" />
					the poet, imagining such a one could not want a mistress, has given him one. These two come in and sing sentiment in lamentable
					strains, neither air nor recitative; only, to one's great joy, they are every now and then interrupted by a dance, or (to one's great
					sorrow) by a chorus that borders the stage from one end to the other, and screams, past all power of simile to represent. The second
					act was Baucis and Philemon.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.596tm" /> Baucis is a beautiful young shepherdess, and Philemon her swain. Jupiter
					falls in love with her, but nothing will prevail upon her; so it is all mighty well, and the chorus sing and dance the praises of
					Constancy. The two other acts were about Iphis and Ianthe,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.597tm" /> and the judgment of Paris. Imagine, I say,
					all this transacted by cracked voices, trilling divisions upon two notes and a half, accompanied by an orchestra of humstrums, and a
					whole house more attentive than if Farinelli<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.598tm" /> sung, and you will almost have formed a just notion of
					the thing.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.599tm" /> Our astonishment at their absurdity you can never conceive; we had enough to do to express
					it by screaming an hour louder than the whole dramatis personæ. We have also seen twice the Comedie Françoise; first, the Mahomet
						Second,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.600tm" /> a tragedy that has had a great run of late; and the thing itself does not want its beauties,
					but the actors are beyond measure delightful. Mademoiselle Gaussin<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.601tm" /> (Mr. Voltaire's Zara<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.602tm" />) has with a charming (though little) person the most pathetic tone of voice, the finest expression in her
					face, and most proper action imaginable. There is also a Dufrêne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.603tm" /> who did the chief character, a
					handsome man and a prodigious fine actor. The second we saw was the Philosophe marié,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.604tm" /> and here they
					performed as well in comedy; there is a Mademoiselle Quinault,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.605tm" /> somewhat in Mrs. Clive's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.606tm" /> way, and a Monsieur Grandval,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.607tm" /> in the nature of Wilks,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.608tm" /> who is the genteelest thing in the world. There are several more would be much admired in England, and many
					(whom we have not seen) much celebrated here. Great part of our time is spent in seeing churches and palaces full of fine pictures,
					&amp;c., the quarter of which is not yet exhausted. For my part, I could entertain myself this month merely with the common streets and
					the people in them. [...]</p>

					<salute>Dear Ashton,</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>You and West have made us happy to night in a heap of letters, &amp; we are resolvd to repay you tenfold. Our English perhaps may not
					be the best in the World, but we have the Comfort to know that it is at least as good as our French. So to begin. Paris is a huge round
					City, divided by the Seine, a very near relation (if we may judge from the resemblance) of your old acquaintance, that ancient river,
					the river Cam. Along it on either side runs a key of perhaps as handsome buildings, as any in the World. the view down which on either
					hand from the Pont Neuf is the charming'st Sight imaginable. There are infinite Swarms of inhabitants &amp; more Coaches than Men. The
					Women in general dressd in Sacs, flat Hoops of 5 yards wide nosegays of artificial flowers, on one shoulder, and faces dyed in Scarlet
					up to the Eyes. The Men in bags,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.610tm" /> roll-upps,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.611tm" /> Muffs and
						Solitaires.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.612tm" /> our Mornings have been mostly taken up in Seeing Sights: few Hotels or Churches have
					escapd us, where there is anything remarkable as to building, Pictures or Statues.</p>
				<p>Mr Conway is as usual, the Companion of our travels, who, till we came, had not seen anything at all; for it is not the fashion here
					to have Curiosity. We had at first arrival an inundation of Visits pouring in upon us, for all the English are acquainted, and herd
					much together &amp; it is no easy Matter to disengage oneself from them, so that one sees but little of the French themselves. </p>
				<p>To be introduced to the People of high quality, it is absolutely necessary to be master of the Language, for it is not to be imagind
					that they will take pains to understand anybody, or to correct a stranger's blunders. Another thing is, there is not a House where they
					don't play, nor is any one at all acceptable, unless they do so too .. a professed Gamester being the most advantageous Character a Man
					can have at Paris. The Abbés indeed &amp; Men of learning are a People of easy access enough, but few English that travel have
					knowledge enough to take any great Pleasure in their Company, at least our present Set of travellers have not. We are, I think to
					remain here no longer than Ld Conway stays, and then set out for Rheims, there to reside a Month or two, &amp; then to return hither
					again. this is our present design &amp; very often little hankerings break out, so that I am not sure, we shall not come back
					tomorrow.</p>
				<p>We are exceedingly unsettled &amp; irresolute, don't know our own Minds for two Moments together, profess an utter aversion for all
					Manner of fatigue, grumble, are ill natured &amp; try to bring ourselves to a State of perfect Apathy in which [we] are so far
					advanced, as to declare we have no Notion of caring for any mortal breathing but ourselves. In short I think the greatest <hi
						rend="italic">evil</hi> [that] could have happen'd to us, is our liberty, for we are not at all capable to determine our own
					actions.</p>

				<p>After the little particulars aforesaid I should have proceeded to a journal of our transactions for this week past, should have
					carried you post from hence to Versailles, hurried you through the gardens to Trianon, back again to Paris, so away to Chantilly. But
					the fatigue is perhaps more than you can bear, and moreover I think I have reason to stomach your last piece of gravity. Supposing you
					were in your soberest mood, I am sorry you should think me capable of ever being so dissipé, so evaporé, as not to be in a condition of
					relishing any thing you could say to me. And now, if you have a mind to make your peace with me, arouse ye from your megrims and your
					melancholies, and (for exercise is good for you) throw away your night-cap, call for your jack-boots, and set out with me, last
					Saturday evening, for Versailles&#x2013;and so at eight o'clock, passing through a road speckled with vines, and villas, and hares, and
					partridges, we arrive at the great avenue, flanked on either hand with a double row of trees about half a mile long, and with the
					palace itself to terminate the view; facing which, on each side of you is placed a semi-circle of very handsome buildings, which form
					the stables. These we will not enter into, because you know we are no jockies. Well! and is this the great front of Versailles? What a
					huge heap of littleness!<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.614tm" /> it is composed, as it were, of three courts, all open to the eye at once, and
					gradually diminishing till you come to the royal apartments, which on this side present but half a dozen windows and a balcony. This
					last is all that can be called a front, for the rest is only great wings. The hue of all this mass is black, dirty red, and yellow; the
					first proceeding from stone changed by age; the second, from a mixture of brick; and the last, from a profusion of tarnished gilding.
					You cannot see a more disagreeable tout-ensemble; and, to finish the matter, it is all stuck over in many places with small busts of a
					tawny hue between every window. We pass through this to go into the garden, and here the case is indeed altered; nothing can be vaster
					and more magnificent than the back front; before it a very spacious terrace spreads itself, adorned with two large basons; these are
					bordered and lined (as most of the others) with white marble, with handsome statues of bronze reclined on their edges. From hence you
					descend a huge flight of steps into a semi-circle formed by woods, that are cut all round into niches, which are filled with beautiful
					copies of all the famous antique statues in white marble. </p>
				<p>Just in the midst is the bason of Latona; she and her children are standing on the top of a rock in the middle, on the sides of which
					are the peasants, some half, some totally changed into frogs, all which throw out water at her in great plenty. From this place runs on
					the great alley, which brings you into a complete round, where is the bason of Apollo, the biggest in the gardens. He is rising in his
					car out of the water, surrounded by nymphs and tritons, all in bronze, and finely executed, and these, as they play, raise a perfect
					storm about him; beyond this is the great canal, a prodigious long piece of water, that terminates the whole: All this you have at one
					coup d'œil in entering the garden, which is truly great. I cannot say as much of the general taste of the place; every thing you behold
					savours too much of art; all is forced, all is constrained about you; statues and vases sowed every where without distinction;
					sugar-loaves and minced-pies of yew; scrawl-work of box, and little squirting jets-d'eau, besides a great sameness in the walks, cannot
					help striking one at first sight, not to mention the silliest of labyrinths, and all Æsop's fables in water; since these were designed
					in usum Delphini only. Here then we walk by moonlight, and hear the ladies and the nightingales sing. Next morning, being Whitsunday,
					make ready to go to the Installation of nine Knights du Saint Esprit, Cambis is one:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.615tm" /> high mass
					celebrated with music, great croud, much incense, King,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.616tm" /> Queen,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.617tm" />
						Dauphin,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.618tm" /> Mesdames,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.619tm" /> Cardinals, and Court: Knights arrayed by his
					majesty; reverences before the altar, not bows, but curtsies; stiff hams; much tittering among the ladies; trumpets, kettle-drums and
					fifes. My dear West, I am vastly delighted with Trianon, all of us with Chantilly; if you would know why, you must have patience, for I
					can hold my pen no longer, except to tell you that I saw Britannicus<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.620tm" /> last Night; all the characters,
					particularly Agrippina and Nero, done to perfection; to-morrow Phædra and Hippolitus.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.621tm" /> We are making
					you a little bundle of petites pieces; there is nothing in them, but they are acting at present; there are too Crebillon's
						Letters,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.622tm" /> and Amusemens sur le langage des Bêtes, said to be of one Bougeant,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.623tm" /> a Jesuit; they are both esteemed, and lately come out. This day se'nnight we go to Rheims.</p>

				<p>I shall not make you any excuses, because I can't: I shall not try to entertain you with descriptions, for the same reason; &amp;
					moreover, because I believe you don't care for them. so that you can have no occasion to wonder at my brevity, when you consider me, as
					confined to the narrow bounds of the history of We, quatenus We. which I continue. </p>
				<p>Our tête à tête conversations, that you enquire after, did consist less in words, than in looks &amp; signs, &amp; to give you a
					notion of them, I ought to send you our pictures; tho' we should find it difficult to set for 'em in such attitudes, as we very
					naturally fall into, when alone together. at present Mr Conway, who lives with us, joins to make them a little more verbose, &amp;
					every thing is mighty well. on Monday next we set out for Rheims, (where we expect to be very dull;) there to stay a month or two; then
					we cross Burgundy, &amp; Dauphiny, &amp; so go to Avignon, Aix, Marseilles, &amp;c: the weather begins to be violently hot already even
					here, &amp; this is our ingenious contrivance, as the summer increases, to seek out cool retreats among the scorch'd rocks of Provence;
					I will not promise, but that if next winter bid fair for extreme cold, we shall take a trip to Muscovy. you in the mean time will be
					quietly enjoying the temperate air of England under your own vine, &amp; under your own (at least under Mrs Lewis's)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.625tm" /> Fig-tree; &amp; I don't doubt but the fruits of your leisure will turn to more account, than those of our
					laborious peregrination, and while our thoughts are rambling about, &amp; changeing situation oftener than our bodies, you will be
					fixing your attention upon some weighty truth, worthy a Sage of your honour's magnitude. the end of your researches, I mean whatever
					your profound contemplation brings to light, I should be proud to be acquainted with; whither it please to be invoked under the
					appellation of Sermon, Vision, Essay, or discourse: in short, on whatever head you chuse to be loquacious (Wall on
						Infant-Baptism<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.626tm" /> excepted) a dissertation will be very acceptable, &amp; received with a reverence due
					to the hand it comes from.</p>
				<p>We have seen here your Gustavus Vasa,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.627tm" /> that had raised the general expectation so high long ago. a
					worthy piece of prohibited marchandise in truth! the town must have been extreme mercifully disposed; if, for the sake of ten innocent
					lines, that may peradventure be pick'd out, it had consented to spare the lives of the ten thousand wicked ones, that remain. I don't
					know what condition your Stage is in, but the French is in a very good one at present; among the rest they have a Madlle
						Duminie,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.628tm" /> whose every look &amp; gesture is violent Nature; she is Passion itself incarnate: I saw her
					the other night do the Phædra of Racine in a manner; which affected me so strongly, that, as you see, I can't help prattling about her
					even to you, that do not care two-pence. </p>
				<p>You have got My Ld Conway there among ye; what do people think about him, &amp; his improvements? you possibly see him sometimes, for
					he visits at Mrs Conduit's. is he charming, &amp; going to be married, like Mr Barrett? pray, write to me, &amp; persuade West to do
					the same, who unless you rouse him, &amp; preach to him, what a sin it is to have the vapours, &amp; the dismals, will neglect himself;
					I won't say, his friends; that I believe him incapable of. I again recommend him to your care, that you may nourish him, &amp; cherish
					him, &amp; administer to him some of that cordial spirit of chearfulness, that you used to have the Receipt of. my Compliments to my

				<p>We have now been settled almost three weeks in this city, which is more considerable upon account of its size and antiquity, than
					from the number of its inhabitants, or any advantages of commerce. There is little in it worth a stranger's curiosity, besides the
					cathedral church, which is a vast Gothic building of a surprising beauty and lightness, all covered over with a profusion of little
					statues, and other ornaments. It is here the Kings of France are crowned by the Archbishop of Rheims, who is the first Peer, and the
					Primate of the kingdom: The holy vessel made use of on that occasion, which contains the oil, is kept in the church of St.
						Nicasius<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.632tm" /> hard by, and is believed to have been brought by an angel from heaven at the coronation of
					Clovis, the first christian king. The streets in general have but a melancholy aspect, the houses all old; the public walks run along
					the side of a great moat under the ramparts, where one hears a continual croaking of frogs; the country round about is one great plain
					covered with vines, which at this time of the year afford no very pleasing prospect, as being not above a foot high. What pleasures the
					place denies to the sight, it makes up to the palate; since you have nothing to drink but the best champaigne in the world, and all
					sort of provisions equally good. As to other pleasures, there is not that freedom of conversation among the people of fashion here,
					that one sees in other parts of France; for though they are not very numerous in this place, and consequently must live a good deal
					together, yet they never come to any great familiarity with one another. As my Lord Conway had spent a good part of his time among
					them, his brother, and we with him, were soon introduced into all their assemblies: As soon as you enter, the lady of the house
					presents each of you a card, and offers you a party at quadrille; you sit down, and play forty deals without intermission, excepting
					one quarter of an hour, when every body rises to eat of what they call the gouter, which supplies the place of our tea, and is a
					service of wine, fruits, cream, sweetmeats, crawfish and cheese. People take what they like, and sit down again to play; after that,
					they make little parties to go to the walks together, and then all the company retire to their separate habitations. Very seldom any
					suppers or dinners are given; and this is the manner they live among one another; not so much out of any aversion they have to
					pleasure, as out of a sort of formality they have contracted by not being much frequented by people who have lived at Paris. It is sure
					they do not hate gaiety any more than the rest of their country-people, and can enter into diversions, that are once proposed, with a
					good grace enough; for instance, the other evening we happened to be got together in a company of eighteen people, men and women of the
					best fashion here, at a garden in the town to walk; when one of the ladies bethought herself of asking, Why should not we sup here?
					Immediately the cloth was laid by the side of a fountain under the trees, and a very elegant supper served up; after which another
					said, Come, let us sing; and directly began herself: From singing we insensibly fell to dancing, and singing in a round; when somebody
					mentioned the violins, and immediately a company of them was ordered: Minuets were begun in the open air, and then came country-dances,
					which held till four o'Clock next morning; at which hour the gayest lady there proposed, that such as were weary should get into their
					coaches, and the rest of them should dance before them with the music in the van; and in this manner we paraded through all the
					principal streets of the city, and waked every body in it. Mr. Walpole had a mind to make a custom of the thing, and would have given a
					ball in the same manner next week, but the women did not come into it; so I believe it will drop, and they will return to their dull
					cards, and usual formalities. We are not to stay above a month longer here, and shall then go to Dijon, the chief city of Burgundy, a
					very splendid and very gay town; at least such is the present design. </p>

				<p>The exceeding Slowness and Sterility of me, &amp; this Place &amp; the vast abundance &amp; volubility of Mr Walpole &amp; his Pen
					will sufficiently excuse to you the shortness of this little matter. He insists that it is not him, but his Pen that is so volubility,
					&amp; so I have borrowd it of him; but I find it is both of 'em that is so volubility, for tho I am writing as fast, as I can drive,
					yet he is still chattering in vast abundance. I have desired me to hold his tongue, pho, I mean him, &amp; his, but his Pen is so used
					to write in the first Person, that I have screwd my finger &amp; thumb off, with forcing it, into the third. After all this confusion
					of Persons, &amp; a little stroke of Satyr upon me the Pen returns calmly back again into the old <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> &amp; <hi
						rend="italic">me,</hi> as if nothing had happend to tell you how much I am tired, &amp; how cross I am, that this cursed Scheme of

					&amp; the Month they are to stay here, will be entirely slipt away, at least, the agreable Part of it, and if we journey at all, it
					will be thro' dirty roads, &amp; falling leaves. </p>
				<p>The Man, whose arguments you have so learnedly stated,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.637tm" /> &amp; whom you did not think fit to honour
					with a Confutation, we from thence conceive to be one, who does us honour, in thinking us fools, &amp; so you see, I lay my Claim to a

					either Sr T: G: himself, or your friend Mr Fenton, if it's them we don't care, &amp; if it is not, we don't care neither, but if you
					care to convince the Man, whoever he be, that we are in some points not altogether fools, you might let him know that we are most

				<p>I am not so ignorant of Pain myself as to be able to hear of anothers Sufferings, without any Sensibility to them, especially when
					they are those of One, I ought more particularly to feel for; tho' indeed the goodness of my own Constitution, is in some Sense a
					Misfortune to me, for as the health of everybody I love seems much more precarious than my own, it is but a melancholy prospect to
					consider myself as one, that may possibly in some years be left in the World, destitute of the advice or good Wishes of those few
					friends, that usd to care for me, and without a likelihood or even a desire of gaining any new ones. this letter will, I hope, find you
					perfectly recoverd, &amp; your own painful experience will, for the future, teach you not to give so much in to a sedentary Life, that
					has [I] fear been the Cause of your illness. Give my duty to your Mind, &amp; tell her she has taken more care of herself, than of my
					tother poor friend, your Body, &amp; bid her hereafter remember how nearly <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Welfare is connected with <hi
						rend="italic">his:</hi> tell her too, that she may pride herself in her great family, &amp; despise him for being a poor Mortal, as
					much as she pleases, but that he is her wedded husband, &amp; if he suffers, she must smart for it. my inferences you will say, don't
					follow very naturally, nor have any great relation to what has been said, but they are as follows.</p>
				<p>Messrs Selwin and Montague have been here these 3 weeks, are by this time pretty heartily tired of Rheims, &amp; return in about a
					week. The day they set out for England, we are to do the same for Burgundy, in our way only as it is said to Provence, but People
					better informd conceive that Dijon will be the end of our expedition. for me, I make everything that does not depend on me, so
					indifferent to me, that if it be to go to the Cape of good Hope I care not: if you are well enough, you will let me know a little of
					the history of West who does not remember there is such a Place as Champagne in the world. </p>

				<p>We have made three short days journey of it from Rheims hither,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.641tm" /> where we arrived the night before
					last: The road we have passed through has been extremely agreeable; it runs through the most fertile part of Champaigne by the side of
					the river Marne, with a chain of hills on each hand at some distance, entirely covered with woods and vineyards, and every now and then
					the ruins of some old castle on their tops; we lay at St. Dizier the first night, and at Langres the second, and got hither the next
					evening time enough to have a full view of this city in entering it: It lies in a very extensive plain covered with vines and corn, and
					consequently is plentifully supplied with both. I need not tell you that it is the chief city of Burgundy, nor that it is of great
					antiquity; considering which one should imagine it ought to be larger than one finds it. However, what it wants in extent, is made up
					in beauty and cleanliness, and in rich convents and churches, most of which we have seen. The palace of the States is a magnificent new
					building, where the Duke of Bourbon is lodged when he comes every three years to hold that Assembly, as governour of the Province. A
					quarter of a mile out of the town is a famous Abbey of Carthusians, which we are just returned from seeing. In their chapel are the
					tombs of the ancient Dukes of Burgundy, that were so powerful, till at the death of Charles the Bold, the last of them, this part of
					his dominions was united by Lewis XI. to the crown of France. To-morrow we are to pay a visit to the Abbot of the Cistercians, who
					lives a few leagues off, and who uses to receive all strangers with great civility; his Abbey is one of the richest in the kingdom; he
					keeps open house always, and lives with great magnificence. We have seen enough of this town already to make us regret the time we
					spent at Rheims; it is full of people of condition, who seem to form a much more agreeable society than we found in Champaigne; but as
					we shall stay here but two or three days longer, it is not worth while to be introduced into their houses. On Monday or Tuesday we are
					to set out for Lyons,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.642tm" /> which is two days journey distant, and from thence you shall hear again from
					me.</p>

				<p>Scavez vous bien, mon cher ami, que je vous hais, que je vous deteste? voila des termes un peu forts; and that will save me, upon a
					just computation, a page of paper and six drops of ink; which, if I confined myself to reproaches of a more moderate nature, I should
					be obliged to employ in using you according to your deserts. What! to let any body reside three months at Rheims, and write but once to
					them? Please to consult Tully de Amicit. page 5, line 25, and you will find it said in express terms, 'Ad amicum inter Remos relegatum
					mense uno quinquies scriptum esto;'<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.644tm" /> nothing more plain, or less liable to false interpretations. Now
					because, I suppose, it will give you pain to know we are in being, I take this opportunity to tell you that we are at the ancient and
					celebrated Lugdunum,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.645tm" /> a city situated upon the confluence of the Rhône and Saône (Arar, I should say)
					two people, who, though of tempers extremely unlike, think fit to join hands here, and make a little party to travel to the
					Mediterranean in company; the lady comes gliding along through the fruitful plains of Burgundy, incredibili lenitate, ita ut oculis in
					utram partem fluat judicari non possit;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.646tm" /> the gentleman runs all rough and roaring down from the
					mountains of Switzerland to meet her; and with all her soft airs she likes him never the worse; she goes through the middle of the city
					in state, and he passes incog. without the walls, but waits for her a little below. The houses here are so high, and the streets so
					narrow, as would be sufficient to render Lyons the dismallest place in the world, but the number of people, and the face of commerce
					diffused about it, are, at least, as sufficient to make it the liveliest: Between these two sufficiencies, you will be in doubt what to
					think of it; so we shall leave the city, and proceed to its environs, which are beautiful beyond expression; it is surrounded with
					mountains, and those mountains all bedroped and bespeckled with houses, gardens, and plantations of the rich Bourgeois, who have from
					thence a prospect of the city in the vale below on one hand, on the other the rich plains of the Lyonnois, with the rivers winding
					among them, and the Alps, with the mountains of Dauphiné, to bound the view. All yesterday morning we were busied in climbing up Mount
					Fourviere, where the ancient city stood perched at such a height, that nothing but the hopes of gain could certainly ever persuade
					their neighbours to pay them a visit: Here are the ruins of the Emperors' palaces, that resided here, that is to say, Augustus and
					Severus; they consist in nothing but great masses of old wall, that have only their quality to make them respected. In a vineyard of
					the Minims are remains of a theatre; the Fathers, whom they belong to, hold them in no esteem at all, and would have showed us their
					sacristy and chapel instead of them: The Ursuline Nuns have in their garden some Roman baths, but we having the misfortune to be men,
					and heretics, they did not think proper to admit us. Hard by are eight arches of a most magnificent aqueduct, said to be erected by
					Antony, when his legions were quartered here: There are many other parts of it dispersed up and down the country, for it brought the
					water from a river many leagues off in La Forez. Here are remains too of Agrippa's seven great roads which met at Lyons; in some places
					they lie twelve feet deep in the ground: In short, a thousand matters that you shall not know, till you give me a description of the
					Païs de Tombridge, and the effect its waters have upon you. </p>

				<p>If wishes could turn to realities, I would fling down my law books, and sup with you to-night. But, alas, here am I doomed to fix,
					while you are fluttering from city to city, and enjoying all the pleasures which a gay climate can afford. It is out of the power of my

				<p>However, so long as I am not deprived of your correspondence, so long shall I always find some pleasure in being at home. And,
					setting all vain curiosity aside, when the fit is over, and my reason begins to come to herself, I have several other powerful motives
					which might easily cure me of my restless inclinations: Amongst these, my Mother's ill state of health is not the least; which was the
					reason of our going to Tunbridge, so that you cannot expect much description or amusement from thence. Nor indeed is there much room
					for either; for all diversions there may be reduced to two articles, gaming and going to church. They were pleased to publish certain
					Tunbrigiana this season; but such ana! I believe there were never so many vile little verses put together before. So much for
					Tunbridge: London affords me as little to say. What! so huge a town as London? Yes, consider only how I live in that town. I never go
					into the gay or high world, and consequently receive nothing from thence to brighten my imagination. The busy world I leave to the
					busy; and am resolved never to talk politics till I can act at the same time. To tell old stories, or prate of old books, seems a
					little musty; and toujours Chapon bouilli, won't do. However, for want of better fare, take another little mouthful of my poetry. </p>

				<p>It is now almost five weeks since I left Dijon, one of the gayest and most agreeable little cities of France, for Lyons, its reverse
					in all these particulars. It is the second in the kingdom in bigness and rank, the streets excessively narrow and nasty; the houses
					immensely high and large; (that, for instance, where we are lodged, has twenty-five rooms on a floor, and that for five stories) it
					swarms with inhabitants like Paris itself, but chiefly a mercantile people, too much given up to commerce, to think of their own, much
					less of a stranger's diversions. We have no acquaintance in the town, but such English as happen to be passing through here, in their
					way to Italy and the South, which at present happen to be near thirty in number. It is a fortnight since we set out from hence upon a
					little excursion to Geneva. We took the longest road, which lies through Savoy, on purpose to see a famous monastery, called the grand
						Chartreuse,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.654tm" /> and had no reason to think our time lost. After having travelled [two]<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.655tm" /> days very slow (for we did not change horses, it being impossible for a chaise to go post in these roads) we
					arrived at a little village, among the mountains of Savoy, called Echelles; from thence we proceeded on horses, who are used to the
					way, to the mountain of the Chartreuse: It is six miles to the top; the road runs winding up it, commonly not six feet broad; on one
					hand is the rock, with woods of pine-trees hanging over head; on the other, a monstrous precipice, almost perpendicular, at the bottom
					of which rolls a torrent, that sometimes tumbling among the fragments of stone that have fallen from on high, and sometimes
					precipitating itself down vast descents with a noise like thunder, which is still made greater by the echo from the mountains on each
					side, concurs to form one of the most solemn, the most romantic, and the most astonishing scenes I ever beheld: Add to this the strange
					views made by the craggs and cliffs on the other hand; the cascades that in many places throw themselves from the very summit down into
					the vale, and the river below; and many other particulars impossible to describe; you will conclude we had no occasion to repent our
					pains. This place St. Bruno chose to retire to, and upon its very top founded the aforesaid Convent, which is the superior of the whole
					order. When we came there, the two fathers, who are commissioned to entertain strangers, (for the rest must neither speak one to
					another, nor to any one else) received us very kindly; and set before us a repast of dried fish, eggs, butter, and fruits, all
					excellent in their kind, and extremely neat. They pressed us to spend the night there, and to stay some days with them; but this we
					could not do, so they led us about their house, which is, you must think, like a little city; for there are 100 fathers, besides 300
					servants, that make their clothes, grind their corn, press their wine, and do every thing among themselves: The whole is quite orderly
					and simple; nothing of finery, but the wonderful decency, and the strange situation, more than supply the place of it. In the evening
					we descended by the same way, passing through many clouds that were then forming themselves on the mountain's side. Next day we
					continued our journey by Chamberry, which, though the chief city of the Dutchy, and residence of the king of Sardinia,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.656tm" /> when he comes into this part of his dominions, makes but a very mean and insignificant appearance; we lay at
					Aix, once famous for its hot baths, and the next night at Annecy; the day after, by noon, we got to Geneva. I have not time to say any
					thing about it, nor of our solitary journey back again. [...]</p>

				<p>In my last I gave you the particulars of our little journey to Geneva: I have only to add, that we stayed about a week, in order to
					see Mr. Conway settled there: I do not wonder so many English choose it for their residence; the city is very small, neat, prettily
					built, and extremely populous; the Rhône runs through the middle of it, and it is surrounded with new fortifications, that give it a
					military compact air; which, joined to the happy, lively countenances of the inhabitants, and an exact discipline always as strictly
					observed as in time of war, makes the little republic appear a match for a much greater power; though perhaps Geneva, and all that
					belongs to it, are not of equal extent with Windsor and its two parks. To one that has passed through Savoy, as we did, nothing can be
					more striking than the contrast, as soon as he approaches the town. Near the gates of Geneva runs the torrent Arve, which separates it
					from the King of Sardinia's dominions; on the other side of it lies a country naturally, indeed, fine and fertile; but you meet with
					nothing in it but meager, ragged, bare-footed peasants, with their children, in extreme misery and nastiness; and even of these no
					great numbers: You no sooner have crossed the stream I have mentioned, but poverty is no more; not a beggar, hardly a discontented face
					to be seen; numerous, and well-dressed people swarming on the ramparts; drums beating, soldiers, well cloathed and armed, exercising;
					and folks, with business in their looks, hurrying to and fro; all contribute to make any person, who is not blind, sensible what a
					difference there is between the two governments, that are the causes of one view and the other. The beautiful lake, at one end of which
					the town is situated; its extent; the several states that border upon it; and all its pleasures, are too well known for me to mention
					them. We sailed upon it as far as the dominions of Geneva extend, that is, about two leagues and a half on each side; and landed at
					several of the little houses of pleasure, that the inhabitants have built all about it, who received us with much politeness. The same
					night we eat part of a trout, taken in the lake, that weighed thirty-seven pounds; as great a monster as it appeared to us, it was
					esteemed there nothing extraordinary, and they assured us, it was not uncommon to catch them of fifty pounds; they are dressed here,
					and sent post to Paris upon some great occasions; nay, even to Madrid, as we were told. The road we returned through was not the same
					we came by: We crossed the Rhône at Seyssel, and passed for three days among the mountains of Bugey, without meeting with any thing
					new: At last we came out into the plains of La Bresse, and so to Lyons again. Sir Robert has written to Mr. Walpole, to desire he would
					go to Italy; which he has resolved to do; so that all the scheme of spending the winter in the South of France is laid aside, and we
					are to pass it in a much finer country. You may imagine I am not sorry to have this opportunity of seeing the place in the world that
					best deserves it: Besides as the Pope<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.658tm" /> (who is eighty-eight, and has been lately at the point of death)
					cannot probably last a great while, perhaps we may have the fortune to be present at the election of a new one, when Rome will be in
					all its glory. Friday next we certainly begin our journey; in two days we shall come to the foot of the Alps, and six more we shall be
					in passing them. Even here the winter is begun; what then must it be among those vast snowy mountains where it is hardly ever summer?
					We are, however, as well armed as possible against the cold, with muffs, hoods, and masks of bever, fur-boots, and bear skins. When we
					arrive at Turin, we shall rest after the fatigues of the journey. [...]</p>

					<dateline>Turin, Nov. 7, N. S. 1739. </dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>I am this night arrived here, and have just set down to rest me after eight days tiresome journey: For the three first we had the
					same road we before past through to go to Geneva; the fourth we turned out of it, and for that day and the next travelled rather among
					than upon the Alps; the way commonly running through a deep valley by the side of the river Arc, which works itself a passage, with
					great difficulty and a mighty noise, among vast quantities of rocks, that have rolled down from the mountain tops. The winter was so
					far advanced, as in great measure to spoil the beauty of the prospect, however, there was still somewhat fine remaining amidst the
					savageness and horror of the place: The sixth we began to go up several of these mountains; and as we were passing one, met with an odd
					accident enough: Mr. Walpole had a little fat black spaniel,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.660tm" /> that he was very fond of, which he
					sometimes used to set down, and let it run by the chaise side. We were at that time in a very rough road, not two yards broad at most;
					on one side was a great wood of pines, and on the other a vast precipice; it was noon-day, and the sun shone bright, when all of a
					sudden, from the wood-side, (which was as steep upwards, as the other part was downwards) out rushed a great wolf, came close to the
					head of the horses, seized the dog by the throat, and rushed up the hill again with him in his mouth. This was done in less than a
					quarter of a minute; we all saw it, and yet the servants had not time to draw their pistols, or do any thing to save the dog. If he had
					not been there, and the creature had thought fit to lay hold of one of the horses; chaise, and we, and all must inevitably have tumbled
					above fifty fathoms perpendicular down the precipice. The seventh we came to Lanebourg,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.661tm" /> the last town
					in Savoy; it lies at the foot of the famous mount Cenis, which is so situated as to allow no room for any way but over the very top of
					it. Here the chaise was forced to be pulled to pieces, and the baggage and that to be carried by mules: We ourselves were wrapped up in
					our furs, and seated upon a sort of matted chair without legs, which is carried upon poles in the manner of a bier, and so begun to
					ascend by the help of eight men. It was six miles to the top, where a plain opens itself about as many more in breadth, covered
					perpetually with very deep snow, and in the midst of that a great lake of unfathomable depth, from whence a river takes its rise, and
					tumbles over monstrous rocks quite down the other side of the mountain. The descent is six miles more, but infinitely more steep than
					the going up; and here the men perfectly fly down with you, stepping from stone to stone with incredible swiftness in places where none
					but they could go three paces without falling. The immensity of the precipices, the roaring of the river and torrents that run into it,
					the huge craggs covered with ice and snow, and the clouds below you and about you, are objects it is impossible to conceive without
					seeing them; and though we had heard many strange descriptions of the scene, none of them at all came up to it. We were but five hours
					in performing the whole, from which you may judge of the rapidity of the men's motion. We are now got into Piedmont, and stopped a
					little while at La Ferriere, a small village about three quarters of the way down, but still among the clouds, where we began to hear a
					new language spoken round about us; at last we got quite down, went through the Pás de Suse, a narrow road among the Alps, defended by
					two fortresses, and lay at Bossolens: Next evening through a fine avenue of nine miles in length, as straight as a line, we arrived at
					this city,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.662tm" /> which, as you know, is the capital of the Principality, and the residence of the King of
					Sardinia. [...]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.663tm" /> We shall stay here, I believe, a fortnight, and proceed for Genoa, which is three or
					four days journey to go post.</p>

				<p>After eight days journey through Greenland, we arrived at Turin. You approach it by a handsome avenue of nine miles long, and quite
					strait. The entrance is guarded by certain vigilant dragons, called Douaniers, who mumbled us for some time. The city is not large, as
					being a place of strength, and consequently confined within its fortifications; it has many beauties and some faults; among the first
					are streets all laid out by the line, regular uniform buildings, fine walks that surround the whole, and in general a good lively clean
					appearance: But the houses are of brick plaistered, which is apt to want repairing; the windows of oiled paper, which is apt to be
					torn; and every thing very slight, which is apt to tumble down. There is an excellent Opera, but it is only in the Carnival: Balls
					every night, but only in the Carnival: Masquerades, too, but only in the Carnival. This Carnival lasts only from Christmas to Lent; one
					half of the remaining part of the year is passed in remembering the last, the other in expecting the future Carnival. We cannot well
					subsist upon such slender diet, no more than upon an execrable Italian Comedy, and a Puppet-Show, called Rappresentazione d'un' anima
					dannata, which, I think, are all the present diversions of the place; except the Marquise de Cavaillac's Conversazione, where one goes
					to see people play at Ombre and Taroc,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.665tm" /> a game with 72 cards all painted with suns, and moons, and
					devils and monks. Mr. Walpole has been at court; the family are at present at a country palace, called La Venerie. The palace here in
					town is the very quintessence of gilding and looking-glass; inlaid floors, carved pannels, and painting, wherever they could stick a
					brush. I own I have not, as yet, any where met with those grand and simple works of Art, that are to amaze one, and whose sight one is
					to be the better for: But those of Nature have astonished me beyond expression. In our little journey up to the Grande
						Chartreuse,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.666tm" /> I do not remember to have gone ten paces without an exclamation, that there was no
					restraining: Not a precipice, not a torrent, not a cliff, but is pregnant with religion and poetry. There are certain scenes that would
					awe an atheist into belief, without the help of other argument. One need not have a very fantastic imagination to see spirits there at
					noon-day: You have Death perpetually before your eyes, only so far removed, as to compose the mind without frighting it. I am well
					persuaded St. Bruno was a man of no common genius, to choose such a situation for his retirement; and perhaps should have been a
					disciple of his, had I been born in his time. You may believe Abelard and Heloïse were not forgot upon this occasion: If I do not
					mistake, I saw you too every now and then at a distance among the trees; il me semble, que j'ai vu ce chien de visage là quelque part.
					You seemed to call to me from the other side of the precipice, but the noise of the river below was so great, that I really could not
					distinguish what you said; it seemed to have a cadence like verse. In your next you will be so good to let me know what it was. The
					week we have since passed among the Alps, has not equalled the single day upon that mountain, because the winter was rather too far
					advanced, and the weather a little foggy. However, it did not want its beauties; the savage rudeness of the view is inconceivable
					without seeing it: I reckoned in one day, thirteen cascades, the least of which was, I dare say, one hundred feet in height. I had Livy
					in the chaise with me, and beheld his 'Nives cœlo propè immistæ, tecta informia imposita rupibus, pecora jumentaque torrida frigore,
					homines intonsi &amp; inculti, animalia inanimaque omnia rigentia gelu; omnia confragosa, præruptaque'.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.667tm"
					 /> The creatures that inhabit them are, in all respects, below humanity; and most of them, especially women, have the tumidum
						guttur,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.668tm" /> which they call goscia. Mont Cenis, I confess, carries the permission mountains have of being
						frightful<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.669tm" /> rather too far; and its horrors were accompanied with too much danger to give one time to
					reflect upon their beauties. There is a family of the Alpine monsters I have mentioned, upon its very top, that in the middle of winter
					calmly lay in their stock of provisions and firing, and so are buried in their hut for a month or two under the snow. When we were down
					it, and got a little way into Piedmont, we began to find 'Apricos quosdam colles, rivosque prope sylvas, &amp; jam humano cultu
					digniora loca'.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.670tm" /> I read Silius Italicus too, for the first time; and wished for you according to
					custom. We set out for Genoa in two days time.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.671tm" />

				<p>At least if they do not, they have a very ill taste; for I never beheld any thing more amiable. Only figure to yourself a vast
					semicircular bason, full of fine blue sea, and vessels of all sorts and sizes, some sailing out, some coming in, and others at anchor;
					and all round it palaces and churches peeping over one another's heads, gardens and marble terrases full of orange and cypress trees,
					fountains, and trellis-works covered with vines, which altogether compose the grandest of theatres.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.673tm" />
					This is the first coup d'oeil, and is almost all I am yet able to give you an account of, for we arrived late last night. To-day was,
					luckily, a great festival, and in the morning we resorted to the church of the Madonna delle Vigne, to put up our little orisons; (I
					believe I forgot to tell you, that we have been sometime converts to the holy Catholic church) we found our Lady richly dressed out,
					with a crown of diamonds on her own head, another upon the child's, and a constellation of wax lights burning before them: Shortly
					after came the Doge, in his robes of crimson damask, and a cap of the same, followed by the Senate in black. Upon his approach began a
					fine concert of music, and among the rest two eunuchs' voices, that were a perfect feast to ears that had heard nothing but French
					operas for a year. We listened to this, and breathed nothing but incense for two hours. The Doge is a very tall, lean, stately, old
					figure, called Costantino Balbi;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.674tm" /> and the Senate seem to have been made upon the same model. They said
					their prayers, and heard an absurd white friar preach, with equal devotion. After this we went to the Annonciata, a church built by the
					family Lomellini, and belonging to it; which is, indeed, a most stately structure, the inside wholly marble of various kinds, except
					where gold and painting take its place. From hence to the Palazzo Doria. I should make you sick of marble, if I told you how it was
					lavished here upon the porticoes, the balustrades, and terrases, the lowest of which extends quite to the sea. The inside is by no
					means answerable to the outward magnificence; the furniture seems to be as old as the founder of the family.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.675tm" /> There great imbossed silver tables tell you, in bas-relief, his victories at sea; how he entertained the
					Emperor Charles, and how he refused the sovereignty of the Commonwealth when it was offered him; the rest is old-fashioned velvet
					chairs, and gothic tapestry. The rest of the day has been spent, much to our hearts' content, in cursing French music and architecture,
					and in singing the praises of Italy. We find this place so very fine, that we are in fear of finding nothing finer. We are fallen in
					love with the Mediterranean sea, and hold your lakes and your rivers in vast contempt. This is</p>
				<q>
					<p>'The happy country where huge lemons grow,'</p>

				</opener>
				<p>Our journey hither has taken up much less time than I expected. We left Genoa (a charming place, and one that deserved a longer stay)
					the week before last; crossed the mountains, and lay that night at Tortona,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.678tm" /> the next at St. Giovanni,
					and the morning after came to Piacenza. That city, (though the capital of a Dutchy) made so frippery an appearance, that instead of
					spending some days there, as had been intended, we only dined, and went on to Parma; stayed there all the following day, which was
					passed in visiting the famous works of Corregio in the Dome, and other churches. The fine gallery of pictures, that once belonged to
					the Dukes of Parma, is no more here; the King of Naples<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.679tm" /> has carried it all thither, and the city had
					not merit enough to detain us any longer, so we proceeded through Reggio to Modena; this, though the residence of its Duke, is an
					ill-built melancholy place, all of brick, as are most of the towns in this part of Lombardy: He himself lives in a private manner, with
					very little appearance of a court about him; he has one of the noblest collections of paintings in the world, which entertained us
					extremely well the rest of that day and a part of the next; and in the afternoon we came to Bologna:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.680tm" />
					So now you may wish us joy of being in the dominions of his Holiness. This is a populous city, and of great extent: All the streets
					have porticoes on both sides, such as surround a part of Covent-Garden, a great relief in summer-time in such a climate; and from one
					of the principal gates to a church of the Virgin, [where is a wonder-working picture, at three miles distance] runs a corridore of the
					same sort, lately finished, and, indeed, a most extraordinary performance. The churches here are more remarkable for their paintings
					than architecture, being mostly old structures of brick; but the palaces are numerous, and fine enough to supply us with somewhat worth
					seeing from morning till night. The country of Lombardy, hitherto, is one of the most beautiful imaginable; the roads broad, and
					exactly straight, and on either hand vast plantations of trees, chiefly mulberries and olives, and not a tree without a vine twining
					about it and spreading among its branches. This scene, indeed, which must be the most lovely in the world during the proper season, is
					at present all deformed by the winter, which here is rigorous enough for the time it lasts; but one still sees the skeleton of a
					charming place, and reaps the benefit of its product, for the fruits and provisions are admirable; in short you find every thing, that
					luxury can desire, in perfection. We have now been here a week, and shall stay some little time longer. We are at the foot of the
					Apennine mountains; it will take up three days to cross them, and then we shall come to Florence, where we shall pass the Christmas.
					Till then we must remain in a state of ignorance as to what is doing in England, for our letters are to meet us there: If I do not find
					four or five from you alone, I shall wonder. </p>

					<dateline>Florence, Dec. 19, N. S. 1739. </dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>We spent twelve days at Bologna,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.682tm" /> chiefly (as most travellers do) in seeing sights; for as we knew no
					mortal there, and as it is no easy matter to get admission into any Italian house, without very particular recommendations, we could
					see no company but in public places; and there are none in that city but the churches. We saw, therefore, churches, palaces, and
					pictures from morning to night; and the 15th of this month set out for Florence,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.683tm" /> and began to cross
					the Apennine mountains; we travelled among and upon them all that day, and, as it was but indifferent weather, were commonly in the
					middle of thick clouds, that utterly deprived us of a sight of their beauties: For this vast chain of hills has its beauties, and all
					the vallies are cultivated; even the mountains themselves are many of them so within a little of their very tops. They are not so
					horrid as the Alps, though pretty near as high; and the whole road is admirably well kept, and paved throughout, which is a length of
					fourscore miles, and more: We left the Pope's dominions, and lay that night in those of the Grand Duke<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.684tm" />
					at Fiorenzuola,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.685tm" /> a paltry little town, at the foot of Mount Giogo, which is the highest of them all.
					Next morning we went up it; the post-house is upon its very top, and usually involved in clouds, or half-buried in the snow. Indeed
					there was none of the last at the time we were there, but it was still a dismal habitation. The descent is most excessively steep, and
					the turnings very short and frequent; however, we performed it without any danger, and in coming down could dimly discover Florence,
					and the beautiful plain about it, through the mists; but enough to convince us, it must be one of the noblest prospects upon earth in
					summer. That afternoon we got thither; and Mr. Mann,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.686tm" /> the resident, had sent his servant to meet us at
					the gates, and conduct us to his house. He is the best and most obliging person in the world. The next night we were introduced at the
					Prince of Craon's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.687tm" /> assembly (he has the chief power here in the Grand Duke's absence). The
						Princess,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.688tm" /> and he, were extremely civil to the name of Walpole, so we were asked to stay supper, which
					is as much as to say, you may come and sup here whenever you please; for after the first invitation this is always understood. We have
					also been at the Countess Suarez's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.689tm" /> a favourite of the late Duke,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.690tm" /> and
					one that gives the first movement to every thing gay that is going forward here. The news is every day expected from Vienna of the
					Great Duchess's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.691tm" /> delivery; if it be a boy, here will be all sorts of balls, masquerades, operas, and
					illuminations; if not, we must wait for the Carnival, when all those things come of course. In the mean time it is impossible to want
					entertainment; the famous gallery, alone, is an amusement for months; we commonly pass two or three hours every morning in it, and one
					has perfect leisure to consider all its beauties. You know it contains many hundred antique statues, such as the whole world cannot
					match, besides the vast collection of paintings, medals, and precious stones, such as no other prince was ever master of; in short, all
					that the rich and powerful house of Medicis has in so many years got together.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.692tm" /> And besides this city
					abounds with so many palaces and churches, that you can hardly place yourself any where without having some fine one in view, or at
					least some statue or fountain, magnificently adorned; these undoubtedly are far more numerous than Genoa can pretend to; yet, in its
					general appearance, I cannot think that Florence equals it in beauty. Mr. Walpole is just come from being presented to the Electress
					Palatine Dowager;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.693tm" /> she is a sister of the late Great Duke's; a stately old lady, that never goes out
					but to church, and then she has guards, and eight horses to her coach. She received him with much ceremony, standing under a huge black
					canopy, and, after a few minutes talking, she assured him of her good will, and dismissed him: She never sees any body but thus in
					form; and so she passes her life, poor woman! [...]</p>

				<p>The Pope is at last dead, and we are to set out for Rome on Monday next. The Conclave is still sitting there, and likely to continue
					so some time longer, as the two French Cardinals are but just arrived, and the German ones are still expected. It agrees mighty ill
					with those that remain inclosed: Ottoboni<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.713tm" /> is already dead of an apoplexy; Altieri<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.714tm" /> and several others are said to be dying, or very bad: Yet it is not expected to break up till after Easter.
					We shall lie at Sienna the first night, spend a day there, and in two more get to Rome. One begins to see in this country the first
					promises of an Italian spring, clear unclouded skies, and warm suns, such as are not often felt in England; yet, for your sake, I hope
					at present you have your proportion of them, and that all your frosts, and snows, and short-breaths are, by this time, utterly
					vanished. I have nothing new or particular to inform you of; and, if you see things at home go on much in their old course, you must
					not imagine them more various abroad. The diversions of a Florentine Lent are composed of a sermon in the morning, full of hell and the
					devil; a dinner at noon, full of fish and meager diet; and, in the evening, what is called a Conversazione, a sort of assembly at the
					principal people's houses, full of I cannot tell what: Besides this, there is twice a week a very grand concert. [...]</p>

				</opener>
				<p>This is the [eighth]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.716tm" /> day since we came to Rome, but the first hour I have had to write to you in.
					The journey from Florence cost us four days, one of which was spent at Sienna, an agreeable, clean, old city, of no great magnificence,
					or extent; but in a fine situation, and good air. What it has most considerable is its cathedral, a huge pile of marble, black and
					white laid alternately, and laboured with a gothic niceness and delicacy in the old-fashioned way. Within too are some paintings and
					sculpture of considerable hands. The sight of this, and some collections that were showed us in private houses, were a sufficient
					employment for the little time we were to pass there; and the next morning we set forward on our journey through a country very oddly
					composed; for some miles you have a continual scene of little mountains cultivated from top to bottom with rows of olive-trees, or else
					elms, each of which has its vine twining about it, and mixing with the branches; and corn sown between all the ranks. This, diversified
					with numerous small houses and convents, makes the most agreeable prospect in the world: But, all of a sudden, it alters to black
					barren hills, as far as the eye can reach, that seem never to have been capable of culture, and are as ugly as useless. Such is the
					country for some time before one comes to Mount Radicofani, a terrible black hill, on the top of which we were to lodge that night. It
					is very high, and difficult of ascent; and at the foot of it we were much embarrassed by the fall of one of the poor horses that drew
					us. This accident obliged another chaise, which was coming down, to stop also; and out of it peeped a figure in a red cloak, with a
					handkerchief tied round its head, which, by its voice and mien, seemed a fat old woman;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.717tm" /> but, upon its
					getting out, appeared to be Senesino,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.718tm" /> who was returning from Naples to Sienna, the place of his birth
					and residence. On the highest part of the mountain is an old fortress, and near it a house built by one of the Grand Dukes for a
					hunting-seat, but now converted into an inn: It is the shell of a large fabrick, but such an inside, such chambers, and accommodations,
					that your cellar is a palace in comparison; and your cat sups and lies much better than we did; for, it being a saint's eve, there was
					nothing but eggs. We devoured our meager fare; and, after stopping up the windows with the quilts, were obliged to lie upon the straw
					beds in our clothes. Such are the conveniences in a road, that is, as it were, the great thoroughfare of all the world. Just on the
					other side of this mountain, at Ponte-Centino, one enters the patrimony of the church; a most delicious country, but thinly inhabited.
					That night brought us to Viterbo, a city of a more lively appearance than any we had lately met with; the houses have glass windows,
					which is not very usual here, and most of the streets are terminated by a handsome fountain. Here we had the pleasure of breaking our
					fast on the leg of an old hare and some broiled crows. Next morning, in descending Mount Viterbo, we first discovered (though at near
					thirty miles distance) the cupola of St. Peter's, and a little after began to enter on an old Roman pavement, with now and then a
					ruined tower, or a sepulcher on each hand. We now had a clear view of the city, though not to the best advantage, as coming along a
					plain quite upon a level with it; however, it appeared very vast, and surrounded with magnificent villas and gardens. </p>
				<p>We soon after crossed the Tiber, a river that ancient Rome made more considerable than any merit of its own could have done: However,
					it is not contemptibly small, but a good handsome stream; very deep, yet somewhat of a muddy complexion. The first entrance of Rome is
					prodigiously striking. It is by a noble gate, designed by Michel Angelo, and adorned with statues; this brings you into a large square,
					in the midst of which is a vast obelisk of granite, and in front you have at one view two churches of a handsome architecture, and so
					much alike that they are called the twins; with three streets, the middlemost of which is one of the longest in Rome. As high as my
					expectation was raised, I confess, the magnificence of this city infinitely surpasses it. You cannot pass along a street but you have
					views of some palace, or church, or square, or fountain, the most picturesque and noble one can imagine. We have not yet set about
					considering its beauties, ancient and modern, with attention; but have already taken a slight transient view of some of the most
					remarkable. St. Peter's I saw the day after we arrived, and was struck dumb with wonder. I there saw the Cardinal d'Auvergne,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.719tm" /> one of the French ones, who, upon coming off his journey, immediately repaired hither to offer up his vows
					at the high altar, and went directly into the Conclave; the doors of which we saw opened to him, and all the other immured Cardinals
					came thither to receive him. Upon his entrance they were closed again directly. It is supposed they will not come to an agreement about
					a Pope till after Easter, though the confinement is very disagreeable. I have hardly philosophy enough to see the infinity of fine
					things, that are here daily in the power of any body that has money, without regretting the want of it; but custom has the power of
					making things easy to one. I have not yet seen his majesty of Great-Britain,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.720tm" /> &amp;c. though I have the
					two boys in the gardens of the Villa Borgese, where they go a-shooting almost every day; it was at a distance, indeed, for we did not
					choose to meet them, as you may imagine. This letter (like all those the English send, or receive) will pass through the hands of that
					family, before it comes to those it was intended for. They do it more honour than it deserves; and all they will learn from thence will
					be, that I desire you to give my duty to my father, and wherever else it is due, and that I am, &amp;c. </p>

				</opener>
				<p>To-day I am just come from paying my adoration at St. Peter's to three extraordinary reliques, which are exposed to public view only
					on these two days in the whole year, at which time all the confraternities in the city come in procession to see them. It was something
					extremely novel to see that vast church, and the most magnificent in the world, undoubtedly, illuminated (for it was night) by
					thousands of little crystal lamps, disposed in the figure of a huge cross at the high altar, and seeming to hang alone in the air. All
					the light proceeded from this, and had the most singular effect imaginable as one entered the great door. Soon after came one after
					another, I believe, thirty processions, all dressed in linen frocks, and girt with a cord, their heads covered with a cowl all over,
					only two holes to see through left. Some of them were all black, others red, others white, others party-coloured; these were
					continually coming and going with their tapers and crucifixes before them; and to each company, as they arrived and knelt before the
					great altar, were shown from a balcony at a great height, the three wonders, which are, you must know, the head of the spear that
					wounded Christ; St. Veronica's handkerchief, with the miraculous impression of his face upon it; and a piece of the true cross, on the
					sight of which the people thump their breasts, and kiss the pavement with vast devotion. The tragical part of the ceremony is half a
					dozen wretched creatures, who with their faces covered, but naked to the waist, are in a side-chapel disciplining themselves with
					scourges full of iron prickles; but really in earnest, as our eyes can testify, which saw their backs and arms so raw we should have
					taken it for a red satin doublet torn, and shewing the skin through, had we not been convinced of the contrary by the blood which was
					plentifully sprinkled about them.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.722tm" /> It is late; I give you joy of Port-Bello,<anchor

						<dateline>Rome, April 16, 1740. N.S. </dateline>
					</opener>
					<p>I'll tell you, West, because one is amongst new things, you think one can always write new things. When I first came abroad, every
						thing struck me, and I wrote its history; but now I am grown so used to be surprised, that I don't perceive any flutter in myself when
						I meet with any novelties; curiosity and astonishment wear off, and the next thing is, to fancy that other people know as much of
						places as one's self; or, at least, one does not remember that they do not. It appears to me as odd to write to you of St. Peter's, as
						it would do to you to write of Westminster-abbey. Besides, as one looks at churches, &amp;c. with a book of travels in one's hand, and
						sees everything particularized there, it would appear transcribing, to write upon the same subjects. I know you will hate me for this
						declaration; I remember how ill I used to take it when anybody served me so that was travelling.&#x2013;Well, I will tell you
						something, if you will love me: You have seen prints of the ruins of the temple of Minerva Medica; you shall only hear its situation,
						and then figure what a villa might be laid out there. 'Tis in the middle of a garden: at a little distance are two subterraneous
						grottos, which were the burial-places of the liberti of Augustus. There are all the niches and covers of the urns with the
						inscriptions remaining; and in one, very considerable remains of an ancient stucco ceiling with paintings in grotesque. Some of the
						walks would terminate upon the Castellum Aquæ Martiæ, St. John Lateran, and St. Maria Maggiore, besides other churches; the walls of
						the garden would be two aqueducts, and the entrance through one of the old gates of Rome. This glorious spot is neglected, and only
						serves for a small vineyard and kitchen-garden. </p>
					<p>I am very glad that I see Rome while it yet exists: before a great number of years are elapsed, I question whether it will be worth
						seeing. Between the ignorance and poverty of the present Romans, every thing is neglected and falling to decay; the villas are
						entirely out of repair, and the palaces so ill kept, that half the pictures are spoiled by damp. At the villa Ludovisi is a large
						oracular head of red marble, colossal, and with vast foramina for the eyes and mouth:&#x2013;the man that showed the palace said it
						was <hi rend="italic">un ritratto della famiglia.</hi> The cardinal Corsini<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.725tm" /> has so thoroughly pushed
						on the misery of Rome by impoverishing it, that there is no money but paper to be seen. He is reckoned to have amassed three millions
						of crowns. You may judge of the affluence the nobility live in, when I assure you, that what the chief princes allow for their own
						eating is a testoon a day; eighteen pence: there are some extend their expense to five pauls, or half a crown: cardinal Albani<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg1a.726tm" /> is called extravagant for laying out ten pauls for his dinner and supper. You may imagine they never have
						any entertainments: so far from it, they never have any company. The princesses and duchesses particularly lead the dismallest of
						lives. Being the posterity of popes, though of worse families than the ancient nobility, they expect greater respect than my ladies
						the countesses and marquises will pay them; consequently they consort not, but mope in a vast palace with two miserable tapers, and
						two or three monsignori, whom they are forced to court and humour, that they may not be entirely deserted. Sundays they do issue forth
						in a vast unwieldy coach to the Corso.</p>
					<p>In short, child, after sunset one passes one's time here very ill; and if I did not wish for you in the mornings, it would be no
						compliment to tell you that I do in the evening. Lord! how many English I could change for you, and yet buy you wondrous cheap! And
						then French and Germans I could fling into the bargain by dozens. Nations swarm here. You will have a great fat French cardinal
						garnished with thirty abbés roll into the area of St. Peter's, gape, turn short, and talk of the chapel of Versailles. I heard one of
						them say t'other day, he had been at the <hi rend="italic">Capitale.</hi> One asked of course how he liked it&#x2013;<hi rend="italic"
							>Ah! il y a assez de belles choses.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>Tell Asheton I have received his letter, and will write next post; but I am in a violent hurry and have no more time; so Gray
						finishes this delicately&#x2014; </p>
				</div>
				<div type="part">
					<p>Not so delicate; nor indeed would his conscience suffer him to write to you, till he received de vos nouvelles, if he had not the
						tail of another person's letter to use by way of evasion. I sha'n't describe, as being in the only place in the world that deserves
						it; which may seem an odd reason&#x2013;but they say as how it's fulsome, and every body does it (and I suppose every body says the
						same thing); else I should tell you a vast deal about the Coliseum, and the Conclave, and the Capitol, and these matters. A-propos du
						Colisée, if you don't know what it is, the prince Borghese will be very capable of giving you some account of it, who told an
						Englishman that asked what it was built for: 'They say 'twas for Christians to fight with tigers in.' We are just come from adoring a
						great piece of the true cross, St. Longinus's spear, and St. Veronica's handkerchief; all which have been this evening exposed to view
						in St. Peter's. In the same place, and on the same occasion last night, Walpole saw a poor creature naked to the waist discipline
						himself with a scourge filled with iron prickles, till he had made himself a raw doublet, that he took for red satin torn, and showing
						the skin through. I should tell you, that he fainted away three times at the sight, and I twice and a half at the repetition of it.
						All this is performed by the light of a vast fiery cross, composed of hundreds of little crystal lamps, which appears through the
						great altar under the grand tribuna, as if hanging by itself in the air. All the confraternities of the city resort thither in solemn
						procession, habited in linen frocks, girt with a cord, and their heads covered with a cowl all over, that has only two holes before to
						see through. Some of these are all black, others parti-coloured and white: and with these masqueraders that vast church is filled, who
						are seen thumping their breast, and kissing the pavement with extreme devotion. But methinks I am describing:&#x2013;'tis an ill
						habit; but this, like everything else, will wear off. We have sent you our compliments by a friend of yours, and correspondent in a
						corner, who seems a very agreeable man; one Mr. Williams:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.727tm" /> I am sorry he staid so little a while in
						Rome. I forget Porto Bello<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.728tm" /> all this while; pray let us know where it is, and whether you or Asheton
						had any hand in the taking of it. Duty to the admiral. Adieu!</p>

					<p>Boileau's Discord dwelt in a College of Monks.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.738tm" /> At present the Lady is in the Conclave. Cardinal
							Corsini<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.739tm" /> has been interrogated about certain Millions of Crowns that are absent from the Apostolic
						Chamber; He refuses giving Account, but to a Pope: However he has set several Arithmeticians to work, to compose Summs, &amp; flourish
						out Expenses, which probably never existed. Cardinal Cibo<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.740tm" /> pretends to have a Banker at Genoa, who
						will prove that he has received three Millions on the Part of the Eminent Corsini. This Cibo is a madman, but set on by others. He had
						formerly some great office in the government, from whence they are generally rais'd to the Cardinalate. After a time, not being
						promoted as he expected, he resign'd his Post, and retir'd to a Mountain where He built a most magnificient Hermitage. There He
						inhabited for two years, grew tir'd, came back and received the Hat. </p>
					<p>Other feuds have been between Card. Portia<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.741tm" /> and the Faction of Benedict the Thirteenth,<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg1a.742tm" /> by whom He was made Cardinal. About a month ago, he was within three Votes of being Pope. he did not apply
						to any Party, but went gleaning privately from all &amp; of a sudden burst out with a Number; but too soon, &amp; that threw Him quite
						out. Having been since left out of their Meetings, he ask'd one of the Benedictine Cardinals the reason; who replied, that he never
						had been their Friend, &amp; never should be of their assemblies; &amp; did not even hesitate to call him Apostate. This flung Portia
						into such a Rage that He spit blood, &amp; instantly left the Conclave with all his Baggage. But the great Cause of their Antipathy to
						Him, was His having been one of the Four, that voted for putting Coscia<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.743tm" /> to Death; Who now regains his
						Interest, &amp; may prove somewhat disagreable to his Enemies; Whose Honesty is not abundantly heavier than His Own. He met Corsini
						t'other Day, &amp; told Him, He heard His Eminence had a mind to his Cell: Corsini answer'd He was very well contented with that He
						had. Oh, says Coscia, I don't mean here in the Conclave; but in the Castle St. Angelo.</p>
					<p>With all these Animosities, One is near having a Pope. Card. Gotti,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.744tm" /> an Old, inoffensive Dominican,
						without any Relations, wanted yesterday but two voices; &amp; is still most likely to succeed. Card. Altieri has been sent for from
						Albano, whither he was retir'd upon account of his Brother's Death,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.745tm" /> &amp; his own Illness; &amp;
						where He was to stay till the Election drew nigh. There! there's a sufficient Competency of Conclave News, I think.</p>
					<p>We have miserable Weather for the Season; Coud You think I was writing to You by my fireside at Rome in the middle of May? the
						Common People say tis occasion'd by the Pope's Soul, which cannot find Rest. </p>
					<p>How goes your War? We are persuaded here of an additional one with France, Lord! it will be dreadfull to return thro Germany. I
						don't know who cooks up the News, here, but we have some Strange Peice every day. One that is much in Vogue, &amp; would not be
						disagreable for US, is, that the Czarina<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.746tm" /> has clap'd the Marquis de la Chetardie<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg1a.747tm" /> in Prison. One must hope till some Months hence tis all contradicted.</p>
					<p>I am balancing in great Uncertainty, whether to go to Naples or stay here; You know 'twoud be provoking to have a Pope chosen just
						as One's Back was turn'd: and if I wait, I fear the Heats may arrive. I don't know what to do. </p>
					<p>We are going to-night to a Great Assembly, at One of the Villas just out of the City, whither all the English are invited;<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg1a.748tm" /> amongst the rest, Mr. Stuard and his two Sons.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.749tm" /> There is one lives with Him
						call'd Lord Dunbar,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.750tm" /> Murray's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.751tm" /> brother, who wou'd be his Minister, if
						he had any Occasion for One. I meet him frequently in public places, &amp; like Him. He is very sensible, very agreable &amp; well
						bred.</p>
					<p>Good night, Child: by the way I have had no letters from England, these two last Posts. </p>
					<closer><salute>Yrs ever.</salute></closer>
				</div>
				<div type="part">
					<p>I am by trade a Finisher of Letters. don't you wonder at the Conclave? instead of being immured, every one in his proper hutch, as
						one used to imagine: they have the liberty of skuttleing out of one hole into another, &amp; might breed, if they were young enough. I
						do assure you every thing one has heard say of Italy is a Lye, &amp; am firmly of opinion, that no mortal was ever here before us. I
						am writeing to prove there never was any such people as the Romans, that this was antiently a Colony of the Jews, and that the
						Coliseum was built on the model of Solomon's Temple. our people have told so many Stories of them, that they don't believe any thing

						the expedition: at least so they say at Naples:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.753tm" /> I'm very sorry, but methinks they seem in a bad
						condition. is West dead to the World in general, or only so to me? for you I have not the impudence to accuse; but you are to take
						this, as a sort of reproof, &amp; I hope you will demean yourself accordingly. you are hereby authorized to make my very particular

					<dateline>Tivoli, May 20, 1740.</dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>This day being in the palace of his Highness the Duke of Modena,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.755tm" /> he laid his most serene commands
					upon me to write to Mr. West, and said he thought it for his glory, that I should draw up an inventory of all his most serene
					possessions for the said West's perusal.&#x2013;Imprimis, a house, being in circumference a quarter of a mile, two feet and an inch;
					the said house containing the following particulars, to wit, a great room. Item, another great room; item, a bigger room; item, another
					room; item, a vast room; item, a sixth of the same; a seventh ditto; an eighth as before; a ninth as abovesaid; a tenth (see No. 1.);
					item, ten more such, besides twenty besides, which, not to be too particular, we shall pass over. The said rooms contain nine chairs,
					two tables, five stools, and a cricket. From whence we shall proceed to the garden, containing two millions of superfine laurel hedges,
					a clump of cypress trees, and half the river Teverone, that pisses into two thousand several chamberpots. Finis.&#x2013;Dame Nature
					desired me to put in a list of her little goods and chattels, and, as they were small, to be very minute about them. She has built here
					three or four little mountains, and laid them out in an irregular semi-circle; from certain others behind, at a greater distance, she
					has drawn a canal, into which she has put a little river of hers, called Anio; she has cut a huge cleft between the two innermost of
					her four hills, and there she has left it to its own disposal; which she has no sooner done, but, like a heedless chit, it tumbles
					headlong down a declivity fifty feet perpendicular, breaks itself all to shatters, and is converted into a shower of rain, where the
					sun forms many a bow, red, green, blue and yellow. To get out of our metaphors without any further trouble, it is the most noble sight
					in the world. The weight of that quantity of waters, and the force they fall with, have worn the rocks they throw themselves among into
					a thousand irregular craggs, and to a vast depth. In this channel it goes boiling along with a mighty noise till it comes to another
					steep, where you see it a second time come roaring down (but first you must walk two miles farther) a greater height than before, but
					not with that quantity of waters; for by this time it has divided itself, being crossed and opposed by the rocks, into four several
					streams, each of which, in emulation of the great one, will tumble down too; and it does tumble down, but not from an equally elevated
					place; so that you have at one view all these cascades intermixed with groves of olive and little woods, the mountains rising behind
					them, and on the top of one (that which forms the extremity of one of the half-circle's horns) is seated the town itself. At the very
					extremity of that extremity, on the brink of the precipice, stands the Sybils' temple, the remains of a little rotunda, surrounded with
					its portico, above half of whose beautiful Corinthian pillars are still standing and entire; all this on one hand. On the other, the
					open Campagna of Rome, here and there a little castle on a hillock, and the city itself on the very brink of the horizon, indistinctly
					seen (being 18 miles off) except the dome of St. Peter's; which, if you look out of your window, wherever you are, I suppose, you can
					see. I did not tell you that a little below the first fall, on the side of the rock, and hanging over that torrent, are little ruins
					which they shew you for Horace's house, a curious situation to observe the </p>
				<q>
					<p>Præceps Anio, &amp; Tiburni lucus, &amp; uda <lb /> Mobilibus pomaria rivis.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.756tm" /></p>
				</q>
				<p>Mæcenas did not care for such a noise, it seems, and built him a house (which they also carry one to see) so situated that it sees
					nothing at all of the matter, and for any thing he knew there might be no such river in the world. Horace had another house on the
					other side of the Teverone, opposite to Mæcenas's; and they told us there was a bridge of communication, by which 'andava il detto
					Signor per trastullarsi coll' istesso Orazio'. In coming hither we crossed the Aquæ Albulæ, a vile little brook that stinks like a
					fury, and they say it has stunk so these thousand years. I forgot the Piscina of Quintilius Varus, where he used to keep certain little
					fishes. This is very entire, and there is a piece of the aqueduct that supplied it too; in the garden below is old Rome, built in
					little, just as it was, they say. There are seven temples in it, and no houses at all: They say there were none. </p>

					<p>We have had the pleasure of going twelve miles out of our way to Palestrina. It has rained all day as if heaven and us were coming
						together. See my honesty, I do not mention a syllable of the temple of Fortune, because I really did not see it; which, I think, is
						pretty well for an old traveller. So we returned along the Via Prænestina, saw the Lacus Gabinus and Regillus, where, you know, Castor
						and Pollux appeared upon a certain occasion.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.757tm" /> And many a good old tomb we left on each hand, and many
						an Aqueduct, </p>
					<q>
						<p>Dumb are whose fountains, and their channels dry. </p>
					</q>
					<p>There are, indeed, two whole modern ones, works of Popes, that run about thirty miles a-piece in length; one of them conveys still
						the famous Aqua Virgo to Rome, and adds vast beauty to the prospect. So we came to Rome again, where waited for us a splendidissimo
						regalo of letters; in one of which came You, with your huge characters and wide intervals, staring. I would have you to know, I expect
						you should take a handsome crow-quill when you write to me, and not leave room for a pin's point in four sides of a sheet royal. Do
						you but find matter, I will find spectacles. </p>
					<p>I have more time than I thought, and I will employ it in telling you about a Ball that we were at the other evening. Figure to
						yourself a Roman villa; all its little apartments thrown open, and lighted up to the best advantage. At the upper end of the gallery,
						a fine concert, in which La Diamantina, a famous virtuosa, played on the violin divinely, and sung angelically; Giovannino and
						Pasqualini (great names in musical story) also performed miraculously. On each side were ranged all the secular grand monde of Rome,
						the Ambassadors, Princesses, and all that. Among the rest Il Serenissimo Pretendente (as the Mantova gazette calls him) displayed his
						rueful length of person, with his two young ones,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.758tm" /> and all his ministry around him. 'Poi nacque un
						grazioso ballo,' where the world danced, and I sat in a corner regaling myself with iced fruits, and other pleasant
						rinfrescatives.</p>

				<p>I am to-day just returned from Alba, a good deal fatigued; for you know the Appian<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.763tm" /> is somewhat
					tiresome. We dined at Pompey's;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.764tm" /> he indeed was gone for a few days to his Tusculan, but, by the care of
					his Villicus, we made an admirable meal. We had the dugs of a pregnant sow, a peacock, a dish of thrushes, a noble scarus just fresh
					from the Tyrrhene, and some conchylia of the Lake with garum sauce: For my part I never eat better at Lucullus's table. We drank half a
					dozen cyathi a-piece of ancient Alban to Pholoë's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.765tm" /> health; and, after bathing, and playing an hour at
					ball, we mounted our essedum again, and proceeded up the mount to the temple. The priests there entertained us with an account of a
					wonderful shower of birds eggs, that had fallen two days before, which had no sooner touched the ground, but they were converted into
					gudgeons; as also that the night past a dreadful voice had been heard out of the Adytum, which spoke Greek during a full half hour, but
					no body understood it. But quitting my Romanities, to your great joy and mine, let me tell you, in plain English, that we come from
					Albano. The present town lies within the inclosure of Pompey's Villa in ruins. The Appian way runs through it, by the side of which, a
					little farther, is a large old tomb, with five pyramids upon it, which the learned suppose to be the burying-place of the family,
					because they do not know whose it can be else. But the vulgar assure you it is the sepulchre of the Curiatii, and by that name (such is
					their power) it goes. One drives to Castel Gondolfo, a house of the Pope's, situated on the top of one of the Collinette, that forms a
					brim to the bason, commonly called the Alban lake. It is seven miles round; and directly opposite to you, on the other side, rises the
					Mons Albanus, much taller than the rest, along whose side are still discoverable (not to common eyes) certain little ruins of the old
					Alba longa. They had need be very little, as having been nothing but ruins ever since the days of Tullus Hostilius. On its top is a
					house of the Constable Colona's, where stood the temple of Jupiter Latialis. At the foot of the hill Gondolfo, are the famous outlets
					of the lake, built with hewn stone, a mile and a half under ground. Livy, you know, amply informs us of the foolish occasion of this
						expence,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.766tm" /> and gives me this opportunity of displaying all my erudition, that I may appear considerable
					in your eyes. This is the prospect from one window of the palace. From another you have the whole Campagna, the City, Antium, and the
					Tyrrhene sea (twelve miles distant) so distinguishable, that you may see the vessels sailing upon it. All this is charming. Mr. Walpole
					says, our memory sees more than our eyes in this country. Which is extremely true; since, for realities, Windsor, or Richmond Hill, is
					infinitely preferable to Albano or Frescati. I am now at home, and going to the window to tell you it is the most beautiful of Italian
					nights, which, in truth, are but just begun (so backward has the spring been here, and every where else, they say.) There is a moon!
					there are stars for you! Do not you hear the fountain? Do not you smell the orange flowers? That building yonder is the Convent of S.
					Isidore; and that eminence, with the cypress trees and pines upon it, the top of M. Quirinal. This is all true, and yet my prospect is
					not two hundred yards in length. We send you some Roman inscriptions to entertain you. The first two are modern, transcribed from the
					Vatican library by Mr. Walpole. </p>

					<dateline>Naples, June [14], 1740. </dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>Our journey hither was through the most beautiful part of the finest country in the world; and every spot of it, on some account or
					other, famous for these three thousand years past.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.771tm" /> The season has hitherto been just as warm as one
					would wish it; no unwholesome airs, or violent heats, yet heard of: The people call it a backward year, and are in pain about their
					corn, wine, and oil; but we, who are neither corn, wine, nor oil, find it very agreeable. Our road was through Velletri, Cisterna,
					Terracina, Capua, and Aversa, and so to Naples. The minute one leaves his Holiness's dominions, the face of things begins to change
					from wide uncultivated plains to olive groves and well-tilled fields of corn, intermixed with ranks of elms, every one of which has its
					vine twining about it, and hanging in festoons between the rows from one tree to another. The great old fig-trees, the oranges in full
					bloom, and myrtles in every hedge, make one of the delightfullest scenes you can conceive; besides that, the roads are wide, well-kept,
					and full of passengers, a sight I have not beheld this long time. My wonder still increased upon entering the city, which I think, for
					number of people, outdoes both Paris and London. The streets are one continued market, and thronged with populace so much that a coach
					can hardly pass. The common sort are a jolly lively kind of animals, more industrious than Italians usually are; they work till
					evening; then take their lute or guitar (for they all play) and walk about the city, or upon the sea-shore with it, to enjoy the
					fresco. One sees their little brown children jumping about stark-naked, and the bigger ones dancing with castanets, while others play
					on the cymbal to them. Your maps will show you the situation of Naples; it is on the most lovely bay in the world, and one of the
					calmest seas: It has many other beauties besides those of nature. We have spent two days in visiting the remarkable places in the
					country round it, such as the bay of Baiæ, and its remains of antiquity; the lake Avernus, and the Solfatara, Charon's grotto, &amp;c.
					We have been in the Sybils' cave and many other strange holes under ground (I only name them, because you may consult Sandy's
						travels);<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.772tm" /> but the strangest hole I ever was in, has been to-day at a place called Portici, where his
					Sicilian Majesty<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.773tm" /> has a country-seat. About a year ago, as they were digging, they discovered some
					parts of ancient buildings above thirty feet deep in the ground: Curiosity led them on, and they have been digging ever since; the
					passage they have made, with all its turnings and windings, is now more than a mile long. As you walk you see parts of an amphitheatre,
					many houses adorned with marble columns, and incrusted with the same; the front of a temple, several arched vaults of rooms painted in
					fresco. Some pieces of painting have been taken out from hence, finer than any thing of the kind before discovered, and with these the
					King has adorned his palace; also a number of statues, medals, and gems; and more are dug out every day. This is known to be a Roman
						town,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.774tm" /> that in the Emperor Titus's time was overwhelmed by a furious eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which
					is hard by. The wood and beams remain so perfect that you may see the grain; but burnt to a coal, and dropping into dust upon the least
					touch. We were to-day at the foot of that mountain, which at present smokes only a little, where we saw the materials that fed the
					stream of fire, which about four years since ran down its side. We have but a few days longer to stay here; too little in conscience
					for such a place. [...]</p>

				<p>I lived at the Temple till I was sick of it: I have just left it, and find myself as much a lawyer as I was when I was in it. It is
					certain, at least, I may study the law here as well as I could there. My being in chambers did not signify to me a pinch of snuff. They
					tell me my father was a lawyer, and, as you know, eminent in the profession;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.776tm" /> and such a circumstance
					must be of advantage to me. My uncle<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.777tm" /> too makes some figure in West-minster hall; and there's another
					advantage: Then my grandfather's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.778tm" /> name would get me many friends. Is it not strange that a young
					fellow, that might enter the world with so many advantages, will not know his own interest? &amp;c. &amp;c.&#x2013;What shall I say in
					answer to all this? For money, I neither dote upon it nor despise it; it is a necessary stuff enough. For ambition, I do not want that
					neither; but it is not to sit upon a bench. In short, is it not a disagreeable thing to force one's inclination, especially when one's
					young? not to mention that one ought to have the strength of a Hercules to go through our common law; which, I am afraid, I have not.
					Well! but then, say they, if one profession does not suit you, you may choose another more to your inclination. Now I protest I do not
					yet know my own inclination, and I believe, if that was to be my direction, I should never fix at all: There is no going by a
					weathercock.&#x2013;I could say much more upon this subject; but there is no talking tête-à-tête cross the Alps. O the folly of young
					men, that never know their own interest! they never grow wise till they are ruined! and then nobody pities them, nor helps
					them.&#x2013;Dear Gray! consider me in the condition of one that has lived these two years without any person that he can speak freely
					to. I know it is very seldom that people trouble themselves with the sentiments of those they converse with; so they can chat about
					trifles, they never care whether your heart aches or no. Are you one of these? I think not. But what right have I to ask you this
					question? Have we known one another enough, that I should expect or demand sincerity from you? Yes, Gray, I hope we have; and I have
					not quite such a mean opinion of myself, as to think I do not deserve it.&#x2013;But, Signor, is it not time for me to ask something
					about your further intentions abroad? Where do you propose going next? an in Apuliam? nam illò si adveneris, tanquam Ulysses, cognosces
					tuorum neminem. Vale. So Cicero prophesies in the end of one of his letters<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.779tm" />&#x2013;and there I
					end.</p>

					<dateline>Florence, July, 1740. </dateline>

				<p>At my return to this city, the day before yesterday, I had the pleasure of finding yours dated June the 9th. The period of our
					voyages, at least towards the south, is come, as you wish. We have been at Naples, spent nine or ten days there, and returned to Rome,
					where finding no likelihood of a Pope yet these three months, and quite wearied with the formal assemblies, and little society of that
					great city, Mr. Walpole determined to return hither to spend the summer, where he imagines he shall pass his time more agreeably than
					in the tedious expectation of what, when it happens, will only be a great show. For my own part, I give up the thoughts of all that
					with but little regret; but the city itself I do not part with so easily, which alone has amusements for whole years. However, I have
					passed through all that most people do, both ancient and modern; what that is you may see, better than I can tell you, in a thousand
					books. The Conclave we left in greater uncertainty than ever; the more than ordinary liberty they enjoy there, and the unusual coolness
					of the season, makes the confinement less disagreeable to them than common, and, consequently, maintains them in their irresolution.
					There have been very high words, one or two (it is said) have come even to blows; two more are dead within this last month,
						Cenci<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.782tm" /> and Portia;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.783tm" /> the latter died distracted; and we left another
						(Altieri)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.784tm" /> at the extremity: Yet nobody dreams of an election till the latter end of September. All
					this gives great scandal to all good catholics, and every body talks very freely on the subject. The Pretender (whom you desire an
					account of) I have had frequent opportunities of seeing at church, at the corso, and other places; but more particularly, and that for
					a whole night, at a great ball given by Count Patrizii to the Prince and Princess Craon,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.785tm" /> (who were
					come to Rome at that time, that he might receive from the hands of the Emperor's minister there the order of the golden fleece) at
					which he and his two sons were present. They are good fine boys, especially the younger, who has the more spirit of the two, and both
					danced incessantly all night long. For him, he is a thin ill-made man, extremely tall and aukward, of a most unpromising countenance, a
					good deal resembling King James the Second, and has extremely the air and look of an idiot, particularly when he laughs or prays. The
					first he does not often, the latter continually. He lives private enough with his little court about him, consisting of Lord
						Dunbar,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.786tm" /> who manages every thing, and two or three of the Preston Scotch Lords, who would be very glad
					to make their peace at home.</p>
				<p>We happened to be at Naples on Corpus Christi Day, the greatest feast in the year, so had an opportunity of seeing their Sicilian
					Majesties to advantage. The King walked in the grand procession, and the Queen<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.787tm" /> (being big with child)
					sat in a balcony. He followed the Host to the church of St. Clara, where high mass was celebrated to a glorious concert of music. They
					are as ugly a little pair as one can see: She a pale girl, marked with the small-pox; and he a brown boy with a thin face, a huge nose,
					and as ungain as possible.</p>
				<p>We are settled here with Mr. Mann in a charming apartment;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.788tm" /> the river Arno runs under our windows,
					which we can fish out of. The sky is so serene, and the air so temperate, that one continues in the open air all night long in a slight
					nightgown without any danger; and the marble bridge is the resort of every body, where they hear music, eat iced fruits, and sup by
					moon-light; though as yet (the season being extremely backward every where) these amusements are not begun. You see we are now coming
					northward again, though in no great haste; the Venetian and Milanese territories, and either Germany or the South of France, (according
					to the turn the war may take) are all that remain for us, that we have not yet seen; as to Loretto, and that part of Italy, we have
					given over all thoughts of it.</p>

				<p>You do yourself and me justice, in imagining that you merit, and that I am capable of sincerity.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.790tm" /> I
					have not a thought, or even a weakness, I desire to conceal from you; and consequently on my side deserve to be treated with the same
					openness of heart. My vanity perhaps might make me more reserved towards you, if you were one of the heroic race, superior to all human
					failings; but as mutual wants are the ties of general society, so are mutual weaknesses of private friendships, supposing them mixt
					with some proportion of good qualities; for where one may not sometimes blame, one does not much care ever to praise. All this has the
					air of an introduction designed to soften a very harsh reproof that is to follow; but it is no such matter: I only meant to ask, Why
					did you change your lodging? Was the air bad, or the situation melancholy? If so, you are quite in the right. Only, is it not putting
					yourself a little out of the way of a people, with whom it seems necessary to keep up some sort of intercourse and conversation, though
					but little for your pleasure or entertainment, (yet there are, I believe, such among them as might give you both) at least for your
					information in that study, which, when I left you, you thought of applying to? for that there is a certain study necessary to be
					followed, if we mean to be of any use in the world, I take for granted; disagreeable enough (as most necessities are) but, I am afraid,
					unavoidable. Into how many branches these studies are divided in England, every body knows; and between that which you and I had
					pitched upon, and the other two, it was impossible to balance long. Examples shew one that it is not absolutely necessary to be a
					blockhead to succeed in this profession. The labour is long, and the elements dry and unentertaining; nor was ever any body (especially
					those that afterwards made a figure in it) amused, or even not disgusted in the beginning; yet, upon a further acquaintance, there is
					surely matter for curiosity and reflection. It is strange if, among all that huge mass of words, there be not somewhat intermixed for
					thought. Laws have been the result of long deliberation, and that not of dull men, but the contrary; and have so close a connexion with
					history, nay, with philosophy itself, that they must partake a little of what they are related to so nearly. Besides, tell me, Have you
					ever made the attempt? Was not you frighted merely with the distant prospect? Had the Gothic character and bulkiness of those volumes
					(a tenth part of which perhaps it will be no further necessary to consult, than as one does a dictionary) no ill effect upon your eye? </p>
				<p>Are you sure, if Coke<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.791tm" /> had been printed by Elzevir, and bound in twenty neat pocket volumes, instead
					of one folio, you should never have taken him up for an hour, as you would a Tully, or drank your tea over him? I know how great an
					obstacle ill spirits are to resolution. Do you really think, if you rid ten miles every morning, in a week's time you should not
					entertain much stronger hopes of the Chancellorship, and think it a much more probable thing than you do at present? The advantages you
					mention are not nothing; our inclinations are more than we imagine in our own power; reason and resolution determine them, and support
					under many difficulties. To me there hardly appears to be any medium between a public life and a private one; he who prefers the first,
					must put himself in a way of being serviceable to the rest of mankind, if he has a mind to be of any consequence among them: Nay, he
					must not refuse being in a certain degree even dependent upon some men who already are so. If he has the good fortune to light on such
					as will make no ill use of his humility, there is no shame in this: If not, his ambition ought to give place to a reasonable pride, and
					he should apply to the cultivation of his own mind those abilities which he has not been permitted to use for others' service. Such a
					private happiness (supposing a small competence of fortune) is almost always in every one's power, and the proper enjoyment of age, as
					the other is the employment of youth. You are yet young, have some advantages and opportunities, and an undoubted capacity, which you
					have never yet put to the trial. Set apart a few hours, see how the first year will agree with you, at the end of it you are still the
					master; if you change your mind, you will only have got the knowledge of a little somewhat that can do no hurt, or give you cause of
					repentance. If your inclination be not fixed upon any thing else, it is a symptom that you are not absolutely determined against this,
					and warns you not to mistake mere indolence for inability. I am sensible there is nothing stronger against what I would persuade you
					to, than my own practice; which may make you imagine I think not as I speak. Alas! it is not so; but I do not act what I think, and I
					had rather be the object of your pity, than you should be that of mine; and, be assured, the advantage I may receive from it, does not
					diminish my concern in hearing you want somebody to converse with freely, whose advice might be of more weight, and always at hand. We
					have some time since come to the southern period of our voyages; we spent about nine days at Naples. It is the largest and most
					populous city, as its environs are the most deliciously fertile country, of all Italy. We sailed in the bay of Baiæ, sweated in the
					Solfatara, and died in the grotta del Cane, as all strangers do; saw the Corpus Christi procession, and the King and the Queen,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.792tm" /> and the city underground,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.793tm" /> (which is a wonder I reserve to tell you of
					another time) and so returned to Rome for another fortnight; left it (left Rome!) and came hither for the summer. You have seen an
					Epistle to Mr. Ashton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.794tm" /> that seems to me full of spirit and thought, and a good deal of poetic fire. I
					would know your opinion. Now I talk of verses, Mr. Walpole and I have frequently wondered you should never mention a certain imitation
					of Spencer, published last year by a namesake of yours,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.795tm" /> with which we are all enraptured and
					enmarvailed.</p>

						<salute>Dear West,</salute>
					</opener>
					<p>I have advised with the most notable antiquarians of this city on the meaning of <hi rend="italic">Thur gut Luetis.</hi> I can get
						no satisfactory interpretation. In my opinion 'tis Welsh. I don't love offering conjectures on a language in which I have hitherto
						made little proficiency, but I will trust you with my explication. You know the famous Aglaughlan, mother of Cadwalladhor, was
						renowned for her conjugal virtues, and grief on the death of her royal spouse. I conclude this medal was struck in her regency, by her
						express order, to the memory of her lord, and that the inscription <hi rend="italic">Thur gut Luetis</hi> means no more than <hi
							rend="italic">her dear Llewis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Llewellin.</hi><anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.797tm" />
					</p>
					<p>In return for your coins I send you two or three of different kinds. The first is a money of one of the kings of Naples; the device,
						a horse; the motto, <hi rend="italic">Equitas regni.</hi> This curious pun is on a coin in the Great Duke's collection, and by great
						chance I have met with a second. Another is, a satirical medal struck on Lewis XIV.; 'tis a bomb, covered with flower-deluces,
						bursting; the motto, <hi rend="italic">Se ipsissimo.</hi> The last, and almost the only one I ever saw with a text well applied, is a
						German medal with a rebellious town besieged and blocked up; the inscription, <hi rend="italic">This kind is not expelled but by
							fasting.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>Now I mention medals, have they yet struck the intended one on the taking of Porto Bello? Admiral Vernon<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg1a.798tm" /> will shine in our medallic history. We have just received the news of the bombarding Carthagena,<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg1a.799tm" /> and the taking Chagre.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.800tm" /> We are in great expectation of some important
						victory obtained by the squadron under sir John Norris:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.801tm" /> we are told the Duke<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg1a.802tm" /> is to be of the expedition: is it true?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.803tm" /> All the letters too talk of
						France's suddenly declaring war; I hope they will defer it for a season, or one shall be obliged to return through Germany.</p>
					<p>The Conclave still subsists, and the divisions still increase; it was very near separating last week, but by breaking into two
						popes; they were on the dawn of a schism. Aldovrandi<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.804tm" /> had thirty-three voices for three days, but
						could not procure the requisite two more; the Camerlingo<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.805tm" /> having engaged his faction to sign a
						protestation against him, and each party were inclined to elect. I don't know whether one should wish for a schism or not; it might
						probably rekindle the zeal for the church in the powers of Europe, which has been so far decaying.</p>
					<p>On Wednesday we expect a third she-meteor. Those learned luminaries the Ladies P[omfret]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.806tm" /> and
							W[alpole]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.807tm" /> are to be joined by the Lady M[ary] W[ortley] M[ontagu].<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.808tm" />
						You have not been witness to the rhapsody of mystic nonsense which these two fair ones debate incessantly, and consequently cannot
						figure what must be the issue of this triple alliance: we have some idea of it. Only figure the coalition of prudery, debauchery,
						sentiment, history, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and metaphysics; all, except the second, understood by halves, by quarters, or not
						at all. You shall have the journals of this notable academy. Adieu, my dear West!</p>

					<p>Though far unworthy to enter into so learned and political a correspondence, I am employed pour barbouiller une page de 7 pouces et

						latitude I cannot justly tell, but it is governed by a prince called Great-duke; an excellent place to employ all one's animal
						sensations in, but utterly contrary to one's rational powers. I have struck a medal upon myself: the device is thus O, and the motto
							<hi rend="italic">Nihilissimo,</hi> which I take in the most concise manner to contain a full account of my person, sentiments,
						occupations, and late glorious successes. If you choose to be annihilated too, you cannot do better than undertake this journey. Here

					<dateline>Florence, Aug. 21, N.S. 1740. </dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>It is some time since I have had the pleasure of writing to you, having been upon a little excursion cross the mountains to Bologna.
					We set out from hence at sunset, passed the Apennines by moon-light, travelling incessantly till we came to Bologna at four in the
					afternoon next day. There we spent a week agreeably enough, and returned as we came. The day before yesterday arrived the news of a
					Pope; and I have the mortification of being within four days journey of Rome, and not seeing his coronation, the heats being violent,
					and the infectious air now at its height. We had an instance, the other day, that it is not only fancy. Two country fellows, strong
					men, and used to the country about Rome, having occasion to come from thence hither, and travelling on foot, as common with them, one
					died suddenly on the road; the other got hither, but extremely weak, and in a manner stupid; he was carried to the hospital, but died
					in two days. So, between fear and laziness, we remain here, and must be satisfied with the accounts other people give us of the matter.
					The new Pope is called Benedict XIV. being created Cardinal by Benedict XIII.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.813tm" /> the last Pope but one.
					His name is Lambertini, a noble Bolognese, and Archbishop of that city.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.814tm" /> When I was first there, I
					remember to have seen him two or three times; he is a short, fat man, about sixty-five years of age, of a hearty, merry countenance,
					and likely to live some years. He bears a good character for generosity, affability, and other virtues; and, they say, wants neither
					knowledge nor capacity. The worst side of him is, that he has a nephew or two; besides a certain young favourite, called Melara, who is
					said to have had, for some time, the arbitrary disposal of his purse and family. He is reported to have made a little speech to the
					Cardinals in the Conclave, while they were undetermined about an election, as follows: 'Most eminent Lords, here are three Bolognese of
					different characters, but all equally proper for the Popedom. If it be your pleasures, to pitch upon a Saint, there is Cardinal
						Gotti;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.815tm" /> if upon a Politician, there is Aldrovandi;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.816tm" /> if upon a Booby,
					here am I.' The Italian is much more expressive, and, indeed, not to be translated; wherefore, if you meet with any body that
					understands it, you may show them what he said in the language he spoke it. 'Eminssimi. Sigri. Ci siamo tré, diversi sì, mà tutti
					idonei al Papato. Si vi piace un Santo, c' è l'Gotti;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.817tm" /> se volete una testa scaltra, e Politica, c' è
						l'Aldrovandé;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.818tm" /> se un Coglione, eccomi!' Cardinal Coscia<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.819tm" /> (the late
					Pope's nephew) as he has had no hand in this election, it is hoped, will be called to account for all his villanous practices. The
					Pretender, they say, has resigned all his pretensions to his eldest boy, and will accept of the Grand Chancellorship, which is thirty
					thousand crowns a-year; the pension he has at present is only twenty thousand. I do not affirm the truth of this last article; because,
					if he does, it is necessary he should take the ecclesiastical habit, and it will sound mighty odd to be called his Majesty the
					Chancellor. &#x2014; So ends my Gazette.</p>

				<p>There was a certain little ode<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.833tm" /> set out from Rome, in a letter of recommendation to you, but possibly
					fell into the enemies' hands, for I never heard of its arrival. It is a little impertinent to enquire after its welfare; but you, that
					are a father, will excuse a parent's foolish fondness. Last post I received a very diminutive letter:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.834tm" />
					It made excuses for its unentertainingness, very little to the purpose; since it assured me, very strongly, of your esteem, which is to
					me the thing; all the rest appear but as the petits agrémens, the garnishing of the dish. P. Bougeant,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.835tm" />
					in his Langage des Bêtes, fancies that your birds, who continually repeat the same note, say only in plain terms, 'Je vous aime, ma
					chere; ma chere, je vous aime;' and that those of greater genius indeed, with various trills, run divisions upon the subject; but that
					the <hi rend="italic">fond,</hi> from whence it all proceeds, is 'toujours je vous aime'. Now you may, as you find yourself dull or in
					humour, either take me for a chaffinch or nightingale; sing your plain song, or show your skill in music, but in the bottom let there
					be, toujours, toujours de l'Amitié.</p>
				<p>As to what you call my serious letter;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.836tm" /> be assured, that your future state is to me entirely
					indifferent. Do not be angry, but hear me; I mean with respect to myself. For whether you be at the top of Fame, or entirely unknown to
					mankind; at the Council-table, or at Dick's coffee-house;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.837tm" /> sick and simple, or well and wise; whatever
					alteration mere accident works in you, (supposing it utterly impossible for it to make any change in your sincerity and honesty, since
					these are conditions sine quâ non) I do not see any likelihood of my not being yours ever.</p>

				<p>The beginning of next spring is the time determined for our return at furthest; possibly it may be before that time. How the interim
					will be employed, or what route we shall take, is not so certain. If we remain friends with France, upon leaving this country we shall
					cross over to Venice, and so return through the cities north of the Po to Genoa; from thence take a felucca to Marseilles, and come
					back through Paris. If the contrary fall out, which seems not unlikely, we must make the Milanese, and those parts of Italy, in our way
					to Venice; from thence pass through the Tirol into Germany, and come home by the Low-Countries. As for Florence, it has been gayer than
					ordinary for this last month, being one round of balls and entertainments, occasioned by the arrival of a great Milanese Lady; for the
					only thing the Italians shine in, is their reception of strangers. At such times every thing is magnificence: The more remarkable, as
					in their ordinary course of life they are parsimonious, even to a degree of nastiness. I saw in one of the vastest palaces in Rome
					(that of Prince Pamfilio) the apartment which he himself inhabited, a bed that most servants in England would disdain to lie in, and
					furniture much like that of a soph<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.839tm" /> at Cambridge, for convenience and neatness. This man is worth
						30,000<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> sterling a year. As for eating, there are not two Cardinals in Rome that allow more than six paoli,
					which is three shillings a day, for the expence of their table;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.840tm" /> and you may imagine they are still
					less extravagant here than there. But when they receive a visit from any friend, their houses and persons are set out to the greatest
					advantage, and appear in all their splendour; it is, indeed, from a motive of vanity, and with the hopes of having it repaid them with
					interest, whenever they have occasion to return the visit. I call visits going from one city of Italy to another; for it is not so
					among acquaintance of the same place on common occasions. The new Pope has retrenched the charges of his own table to a sequin (10s.) a
					meal. The applause which all he says and does meets with, is enough to encourage him really to deserve fame. They say he is an able and
					honest man; he is reckoned a wit too. The other day, when the Senator of Rome came to wait upon him, at the first compliments he made
					him the Pope pulled off his cap: His Master of the Ceremonies, who stood by his side, touched him softly, as to warn him that such a
					condescension was too great in him, and out of all manner of rule: Upon which he turned to him and said, 'Oh! I cry you mercy, good
					Master, it is true, I am but a Novice of a Pope; I have not yet so much as learned ill manners.' [...]</p>

				<p>We still continue constant at Florence, at present one of the dullest cities in Italy. Though it is the middle of the Carnival there
					are no public diversions; nor is masquerading permitted as yet. The Emperor's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.843tm" /> obsequies are to be
					celebrated publickly the 16th of this month; and after that, it is imagined every thing will go on in its usual course. In the mean
					time, to employ the minds of the populace, the Government has thought fit to bring into the city in a solemn manner, and at a great
					expence, a famous statue of the Virgin called the Madonna dell'Impruneta,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.844tm" /> from the place of her
					residence, which is upon a mountain seven miles off. It never has been practised but at times of public calamity; and was done at
					present to avert the ill effects of a late great inundation,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.845tm" /> which it was feared might cause some
					epidemical distemper. It was introduced a fortnight ago in procession, attended by the Council of Regency, the Senate, the Nobility,
					and all the Religious Orders, on foot and bare-headed, and so carried to the great church, where it was frequented by an infinite
					concourse of people from all the country round. Among the rest I paid my devotions almost every day, and saw numbers of people
					possessed with the devil, who were brought to be exorcised. It was indeed in the evening, and the church-doors were always shut before
					the ceremonies were finished, so that I could not be eye-witness of the event; but that they were all cured is certain, for one never
					heard any more of them the next morning. I am to-night just returned from seeing our Lady make her exit with the same solemnities she
					entered. The show had a finer effect than before; for it was dark; and every body (even those of the mob that could afford it) bore a
					white-wax flambeau. I believe there were at least five thousand of them, and the march was near three hours in passing before the
					window. The subject of all this devotion is supposed to be a large Tile with a rude figure in bas-relief upon it. I say supposed,
					because since the time it was found (for it was found in the earth in ploughing) only two people have seen it; the one was, by good
					luck, a saint; the other was struck blind for his presumption. Ever since she has been covered with seven veils; nevertheless, those
					who approach her tabernacle cast their eyes down, for fear they should spy her through all her veils. Such is the history, as I had it
					from the Lady of the house where I stood to see her pass; with many other circumstances; all which she firmly believes, and ten
					thousand beside. </p>
				<p>We shall go to Venice in about six weeks, or sooner. A number of German troops are upon their march into this State, in case the King
					of Naples thinks proper to attack it. It is certain he has asked the Pope's leave for his troops to pass through his country. The
					Tuscans in general are much discontented, and foolish enough to wish for a Spanish government, or any rather than this. [...] </p>

				<p>I know not what degree of satisfaction it will give you to be told that we shall set out from hence the 24th of this month, and not
					stop above a fortnight at any place in our way. This I feel, that you are the principal pleasure I have to hope for in my own country.
					Try at least to make me imagine myself not indifferent to you; for I must own I have the vanity of desiring to be esteemed by somebody,
					and would choose that somebody should be one whom I esteem as much as I do you. As I am recommending myself to your love, methinks I
					ought to send you my picture (for I am no more what I was, some circumstances excepted, which I hope I need not particularize to you);
					you must add then, to your former idea, two years of age, reasonable quantity of dullness, a great deal of silence, and something that
					rather resembles, than is, thinking; a confused notion of many strange and fine things that have swum before my eyes for some time, a
					want of love for general society, indeed an inability to it. On the good side you may add a sensibility for what others feel, and
					indulgence for their faults or weaknesses, a love of truth, and detestation of every thing else. Then you are to deduct a little
					impertinence, a little laughter, a great deal of pride, and some spirits. These are all the alterations I know of, you perhaps may find
					more. Think not that I have been obliged for this reformation of manners to reason or reflection, but to a severer school-mistress,
					Experience. One has little merit in learning her lessons, for one cannot well help it; but they are more useful than others, and
					imprint themselves in the very heart. I find I have been harangueing in the style of the Son of Sirach,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.847tm"
					 /> so shall finish here, and tell you that our route is settled as follows: First to Bologna for a few days, to hear the
						Viscontina<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.848tm" /> sing; next to Reggio, where is a Fair. Now, you must know, a Fair here is not a place
					where one eats ginger-bread or rides upon hobby-horses; here are no musical clocks, nor tall Leicestershire women; one has nothing but
					masquing, gaming, and singing. If you love operas, there will be the most splendid in Italy, four tip-top voices, a new theatre, the
					Duke and Duchess in all their pomps and vanities. Does not this sound magnificent? Yet is the city of Reggio but one step above Old
						Brentford.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.849tm" /> Well; next to Venice by the 11th of May, there to see the old Doge<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.850tm" /> wed the Adriatic Whore. Then to Verona, so to Milan, so to Marseilles, so to Lyons, so to Paris, so to West,
					&amp;c. in sæcula sæculorum. Amen.</p>
				<p>Eleven months, at different times, have I passed at Florence; and yet (God help me) know not either people or language. Yet the place
					and the charming prospects demand a poetical farewell, and here it is. </p>
				<q>
					<p> Oh Fæsulæ amœna <lb /> Frigoribus juga, nec nimiùm spirantibus auris! <lb /> Alma quibus Tusci Pallas decus Apennini <lb /> Esse

				<p>Here comes a letter from you.&#x2013;I must defer giving my opinion of Pausanias till I can see the whole, and only have said what I

					just you should have your revenge; and therefore I send you the beginning not of an Epic Poem, but of a Metaphysic one.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.853tm" /> Poems and Metaphysics (say you, with your spectacles on) are inconsistent things. A metaphysical poem is a
					contradiction in terms. It is true, but I will go on. It is Latin too to increase the absurdity. It will, I suppose, put you in mind of
					the man who wrote a treatise of Canon Law in Hexameters. Pray help me to the description of a mixt mode, and a little Episode about
						Space.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.854tm" />

				<p>I trust to the country, and that easy indolence you say you enjoy there, to restore you your health and spirits; and doubt not but,
					when the sun grows warm enough to tempt you from your fire-side, you will (like all other things) be the better for his influence. He
					is my old friend, and an excellent nurse, I assure you. Had it not been for him, life had often been to me intolerable. Pray do not
					imagine that Tacitus, of all authors in the world, can be tedious. An annalist, you know, is by no means master of his subject; and I
					think one may venture to say, that if those Pannonian affairs are tedious in his hands, in another's they would have been
					insupportable. However, fear not, they will soon be over, and he will make ample amends. A man, who could join the <hi rend="italic"
						>brilliant</hi> of wit and concise sententiousness peculiar to that age, with the truth and gravity of better times, and the deep
					reflection and good sense of the best moderns, cannot choose but have something to strike you. Yet what I admire in him above all this,
					is his detestation of tyranny, and the high spirit of liberty that every now and then breaks out, as it were, whether he would or no. I
					remember a sentence in his Agricola that (concise as it is) I always admired for saying much in a little compass. He speaks of
					Domitian, who upon seeing the last will of that General, where he had made him Coheir with his Wife and Daughter, 'Satis constabat
					lætatum eum, velut honore, judicioque: tam cæca &amp; corrupta mens assiduis adulationibus erat, ut nesciret a bono patre non scribi
					hæredem, nisi malum principem'.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.878tm" />
				</p>
				<p>As to the Dunciad,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.879tm" /> it is greatly admired: the Genii of Operas and Schools,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.880tm" /> with their attendants, the pleas of the Virtuosos and Florists,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.881tm" /> and the
					yawn of dulness in the end,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.882tm" /> are as fine as anything he has written. The Metaphysicians' part<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.883tm" /> is to me the worst; and here and there a few ill-expressed lines, and some hardly intelligible.</p>
				<p>I take the liberty of sending you a long speech of Agrippina;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.884tm" /> much too long, but I could be glad you
					would retrench it. Aceronia, you may remember, had been giving quiet counsels. I fancy, if it ever be finished, it will be in the
					nature of Nat. Lee's Bedlam Tragedy,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.885tm" /> which had twenty-five acts and some odd scenes.</p>

				<p>I own in general I think Agrippina's speech too long; but how to retrench it, I know not:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.887tm" /> But I have
					something else to say, and that is in relation to the style, which appears to me too antiquated. Racine was of another opinion; he no
					where gives you the phrases of Ronsard: His language is the language of the times, and that of the purest sort; so that his French is
					reckoned a standard. I will not decide what style is fit for our English stage; but I should rather choose one that bordered upon
						Cato,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.888tm" /> than upon Shakespear. One may imitate (if one can) Shakespear's manner, his surprizing strokes
					of true nature, his expressive force in painting characters, and all his other beauties; preserving at the same time our own language.
					Were Shakespear alive now, he would write in a different style from what he did. These are my sentiments upon these matters: Perhaps I
					am wrong, for I am neither a Tarpa,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.889tm" /> nor am I quite an Aristarchus.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.890tm" />
					You see I write freely both of you and Shakespear; but it is as good as writing not freely, where you know it is acceptable.</p>
				<p>I have been tormented within this week with a most violent cough; for when once it sets up its note, it will go on, cough after
					cough, shaking and tearing me for half an hour together; and then it leaves me in a great sweat, as much fatigued as if I had been
					labouring at the plough. All this description of my cough in prose, is only to introduce another description of it in verse, perhaps
					not worth your perusal; but it is very short, and besides has this remarkable in it, that it was the production of four o'clock in the
					morning, while I lay in my bed tossing and coughing, and all unable to sleep. &#x2014; </p>
				<q>
					<p>Ante omnes morbos importunissima tussis, <lb /> Quâ durare datur, traxitque sub ilia vires: <lb /> Dura etenim versans imo sub
						pectore regna, <lb /> Perpetuo exercet teneras luctamine costas, <lb /> Oraque distorquet, vocemque immutat anhelam: <lb /> Nec
						cessare locus: sed saevo concita motu <lb /> Molle domat latus, &amp; corpus labor omne fatigat: <lb /> Unde molesta dies, noctemque
						insomnia turbant. <lb /> Nec Tua, si mecum Comes hic jucundus adesses, <lb /> Verba juvare queant, aut hunc lenire dolorem <lb />
						Sufficiant tua vox dulcis, nec vultus amatus.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.891tm" />
					</p>
				</q>
				<p>Do not mistake me, I do not condemn Tacitus: I was then inclined to find him tedious: The German sedition sufficiently made up for
					it; and the speech of Germanicus, by which he reclaims his soldiers, is quite masterly. Your New Dunciad I have no conception of. I
					shall be too late for our dinner if I write any more. </p>

					<dateline>London, April, Thursday<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.893tm" />.</dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>You are the first who ever made a Muse of a Cough; to me it seems a much more easy task to versify in one's sleep, (that indeed you
					were of old famous for)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.894tm" /> than for want of it. Not the wakeful nightingale (when she had a cough) ever
					sung so sweetly. I give you thanks for your warble, and wish you could sing yourself to rest. These wicked remains of your illness will
					sure give way to warm weather and gentle exercise; which I hope you will not omit as the season advances. Whatever low spirits and
					indolence, the effect of them, may advise to the contrary, I pray you add five steps to your walk daily for my sake; by the help of
					which, in a month's time, I propose to set you on horseback.</p>
				<p>I talked of the Dunciad as concluding you had seen it; if you have not, do you choose I should get and send it you? I have myself,
					upon your recommendation, been reading Joseph Andrews.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.895tm" /> The incidents are ill laid and without
					invention; but the characters have a great deal of nature, which always pleases even in her lowest shapes. Parson Adams is perfectly
					well; so is Mrs. Slipslop, and the story of Wilson; and throughout he shews himself well read in Stage-Coaches, Country Squires, Inns,
					and Inns of Court. His reflections upon high people and low people, and misses and masters, are very good. However the exaltedness of
					some minds (or rather as I shrewdly suspect their insipidity and want of feeling or observation) may make them insensible to these
					light things, (I mean such as characterize and paint nature) yet surely they are as weighty and much more useful than your grave
					discourses upon the mind,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.896tm" /> the passions, and what not. Now as the paradisaical pleasures of the
					Mahometans consist in playing upon the flute and lying with Houris, be mine to read eternal new romances of Marivaux<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.897tm" /> and Crebillon.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.898tm" />
				</p>
				<p>You are very good in giving yourself the trouble to read and find fault with my long harangues. Your freedom (as you call it) has so
					little need of apologies, that I should scarce excuse your treating me any otherwise; which, whatever compliment it might be to my
					vanity, would be making a very ill one to my understanding. As to matter of stile, I have this to say: The language of the age is never
					the language of poetry; except among the French, whose verse, where the thought or image does not support it, differs in nothing from
					prose. Our poetry, on the contrary, has a language peculiar to itself; to which almost every one, that has written, has added something
					by enriching it with foreign idioms and derivatives: Nay sometimes words of their own composition or invention. Shakespear and Milton
					have been great creators this way; and no one more licentious than Pope or Dryden, who perpetually borrow expressions from the former.
					Let me give you some instances from Dryden, whom every body reckons a great master of our poetical tongue. &#x2014; Full of <hi
						rend="italic">museful mopeings</hi>&#x2013;unlike the <hi rend="italic">trim</hi> of love&#x2013;a pleasant <hi rend="italic"
						>beverage</hi>&#x2013;a <hi rend="italic">roundelay</hi> of love&#x2013;stood silent in his <hi rend="italic">mood</hi>&#x2013;with
					knots and <hi rend="italic">knares</hi> deformed&#x2013;his <hi rend="italic">ireful mood</hi>&#x2013;in proud <hi rend="italic"
						>array</hi>&#x2013;his <hi rend="italic">boon</hi> was granted&#x2013;and <hi rend="italic">disarray</hi> and shameful rout&#x2013;<hi
						rend="italic">wayward</hi> but wise&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">furbished</hi> for the field&#x2013;the <hi rend="italic">foiled
						dodderd</hi> oaks&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">disherited&#x2013;smouldring</hi> flames&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">retchless</hi> of
						laws&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">crones</hi> old and ugly&#x2013;the <hi rend="italic">beldam</hi> at his side&#x2013;the <hi
						rend="italic">grandam-hag&#x2013;villanize</hi> his Father's fame. &#x2014; But they are infinite: And our language not being a
					settled thing (like the French) has an undoubted right to words of an hundred years old, provided antiquity have not rendered them
					unintelligible. In truth, Shakespear's language is one of his principal beauties; and he has no less advantage over your Addisons and
					Rowes in this, than in those other great excellencies you mention. Every word in him is a picture. Pray put me the following lines into
					the tongue of our modern Dramatics:</p>
				<q>
					<p>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, <lb /> Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass: <lb /> I, that am rudely stampt,
						and want love's majesty <lb /> To strut before a wanton ambling nymph: <lb /> I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, <lb />
						Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, <lb /> Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time <lb /> Into this breathing world, scarce
						half made up&#x2013;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.899tm" />
					</p>
				</q>
				<p>And what follows. To me they appear untranslatable; and if this be the case, our language is greatly degenerated. However, the
					affectation of imitating Shakespear may doubtless be carried too far; and is no sort of excuse for sentiments ill-suited, or speeches
					ill-timed, which I believe is a little the case with me. I guess the most faulty expressions may be these&#x2013;<hi rend="italic"
						>silken</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">dalliance</hi>&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">drowsier</hi> pretensions&#x2013;wrinkled <hi
						rend="italic">beldams&#x2013;arched</hi> the hearer's brow and <hi rend="italic">riveted</hi> his eyes in <hi rend="italic">fearful
						extasie.</hi> These are easily altered or omitted: and indeed if the thoughts be wrong or superfluous, there is nothing easier than to
					leave out the whole. The first ten or twelve lines are, I believe, the best;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.901tm" /> and as for the rest, I
					was betrayed into a good deal of it by Tacitus; only what he has said in five words, I imagine I have said in fifty lines: Such is the
					misfortune of imitating the inimitable. Now, if you are of my opinion, una litura may do the business better than a dozen; and you need
					not fear unravelling my web. I am a sort of spider; and have little else to do but spin it over again, or creep to come other place and
					spin there. Alas! for one who has nothing to do but amuse himself, I believe my amusements are as little amusing as most folks. But no
					matter; it makes the hours pass, and is better than <hi rend="italic">ἐν</hi>
					<hi rend="italic">ἀμαθίᾳ</hi>
					<hi rend="italic">καὶ</hi>
					<hi rend="italic">ἀμουσίᾳ</hi>
					<hi rend="italic">καταβιῶναι</hi>.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.902tm" /></p>

				<p>To begin with the conclusion of your letter, which is Greek, I desire that you will quarrel no more with your manner of passing your
					time. In my opinion it is irreproachable, especially as it produces such excellent fruit; and if I, like a saucy bird, must be pecking
					at it, you ought to consider that it is because I like it. No una litura I beg you, no unravelling of your web, dear Sir! only pursue
					it a little further, and then one shall be able to judge of it a little better. You know the crisis of a play is in the first act; its
					damnation or salvation wholly rests there. But till that first act is over, every body suspends his vote; so how do you think I can
					form, as yet, any just idea of the speeches in regard to their length or shortness? The connexion and symmetry of such little parts
					with one another must naturally escape me, as not having the plan of the whole in my head; neither can I decide about the thoughts
					whether they are wrong or superfluous; they may have some future tendency which I perceive not. The style only was free to me, and
					there I find we are pretty much of the same sentiment: For you say the affectation of imitating Shakespear may doubtless be carried too
					far; I say as much and no more. For old words we know are old gold, provided they are well chosen. Whatever Ennius<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.905tm" /> was, I do not consider Shakespear as a dunghill in the least: On the contrary, he is a mine of antient ore,
					where all our great modern poets have found their advantage. I do not know how it is, but his old expressions have more energy in them
					than ours, and are even more adapted to poetry; certainly, where they are judiciously and sparingly inserted, they add a certain grace
					to the composition; in the same manner as Poussin<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.906tm" /> gave a beauty to his pictures by his knowledge in
					the antient proportions: But should he, or any other painter, carry the imitation too far, and neglect that best of models Nature, I am
					afraid it would prove a very flat performance. To finish this long criticism: I have this further notion about old words revived, (is
					not this a pretty way of finishing?) I think them of excellent use in tales; they add a certain drollery to the comic, and a romantic
					gravity to the serious, which are both charming in their kind; and this way of charming Dryden understood very well. One need only read
					Milton to acknowledge the dignity they give the Epic. But now comes my opinion that they ought to be used in Tragedy more sparingly,
					than in most kinds of poetry. Tragedy is designed for public representation, and what is designed for that should certainly be most
					intelligible. I believe half the audience that come to Shakespear's plays do not understand the half of what they hear.&#x2013;But
					finissons enfin.&#x2013;Yet one word more.&#x2013;You think the ten or twelve first lines the best, now I am for the fourteen
						last;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.907tm" /> add, that they contain not one word of antientry.</p>
				<p>I rejoice you found amusement in Joseph Andrews. But then I think your conceptions of Paradise a little upon the Bergerac.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.908tm" /> Les Lettres du Seraphim R. a Madame la Cherubinesse de Q. What a piece of extravagance would there be!</p>
				<p>And now you must know that my body continues weak and enervate. And for my animal spirits, they are in perpetual fluctuation: Some
					whole days I have no relish, no attention for any thing; at other times I revive, and am capable of writing a long letter, as you see;
					and though I do not write speeches, yet I translate them. When you understand what speech, you will own that it is a bold and perhaps a
					dull attempt. In three words, it is prose, it is from Tacitus, it is of Germanicus.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.909tm" /> Peruse, perpend,
					pronounce.</p>

				<p> I should not have fail'd to answer your Letter immediately, but I went out of town for a little while, wch hinder'd me. its length
					(beside the Pleasure naturally accompanying a long letter from you) affords me a new one, when I think it is a kind of Symptom of the
					Recovery of your Health, &amp; flatter myself that your bodily Strength returns in proportion. pray do not forget to mention the
					Progress you make continually. as to Agrippina, I begin to be of your opinion, &amp; find myself (as Women are of their children) less
					enamour'd of my Productions the older they grow. she is laid up to sleep,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.912tm" /> till next Summer: so bid her
					Good night. I think you have translated Tacitus very justly, that is freely, &amp; accommodated his thoughts to the Turn &amp; Genius
					of our Language. which at the same time I commend your Judgement, is no commendation of the English tongue, which is too diffuse, &amp;
					daily grows more &amp; more enervate, &amp; one shall never be more sensible of this, than in turning an Author like Tacitus. I have
					been trying it in some parts of Thucydides (who has a little resemblance of him in his Conciseness) &amp; endeavour'd to do it closely,
					but found it produced mere Nonsense. if you have any inclination to see what figure he makes in Italian, I have a Tuscan translation of
						Davanzati,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.913tm" /> much-esteem'd in Italy; &amp; will send you the same Speech you sent me: that is, if you

					<p>LIB: 2: ELEG: 1: </p>
					<p>To Mecænas </p>
					<p>You ask, why thus my Loves I still rehearse? <lb /> Whence the soft Strain &amp; ever-melting Verse? <lb /> From Cynthia all, that
						in my Numbers shines; <lb /> She is my Genius, she inspires the Lines, <lb /> No Phœbus else, no other Muse I know: <lb /> She tunes
						my easy Rhime, &amp; gives the Lay to flow. <lb /> If the loose Curls around her Forehead play, <lb /> Or lawless o'er their Ivory
						Margin stray: <lb /> If the thin Coan Web her Shape reveal, <lb /> And half disclose the Limbs it should conceal. <lb /> Of those
						loose Curls, that ivory Front I write; <lb /> Of the dear Web whole Volumes I indite: <lb /> Or if to Musick she the Lyre awake,
						<lb /> That the soft Subject of my Song I make; <lb /> And sing, with what a careless Grace she flings <lb /> Her artful Hand across
						the sounding Strings. <lb /> If sinking into Sleep she seem to close <lb /> Her languid Lids, I favour her Repose <lb /> With lulling
						Notes, &amp; thousand Beauties see, <lb /> That Slumber brings to aid my Poetry. <lb /> When less averse, &amp; yielding to Desires
						<lb /> She half accepts, &amp; half rejects my Fires: <lb /> While to retain the envious Lawn she tries, <lb /> And struggles to elude
						my longing Eyes: <lb /> The fruitful Muse from that auspicious Night <lb /> Dates the long Iliad of the amorous Fight. <lb /> In brief
						whate'er she do, or say, or look <lb /> 'Tis ample Matter for a Lover's Book <lb /> And many a copious Narrative you'll see, <lb />
						Big with th' important Nothing's History. </p>
					<p>Yet would the Tyrant Love permit me raise <lb /> My feeble Voice to sing the Victor's Praise, <lb /> To paint the Hero's Toil, the
						Ranks of War, <lb /> The laurel'd Triumph, &amp; the sculptured Car: <lb /> No Giant-Race, no Tumult of the Skies, <lb /> No
						Mountain-Structure in my Verse should rise; <lb /> No Tale of Thebes, or Ilium there should be, <lb /> Nor how the Persian trod th'
						indignant Sea, <lb /> Nor Marius' Cimbrian Wreaths would I relate, <lb /> Nor lofty Carthage struggleing with her Fate: <lb /> Here
						should Augustus great in Arms appear, <lb /> And thou, Mecænas, be my second Care: <lb /> Here Mutina from Flames &amp; Famine free
						<lb /> And there th' ensanguin'd Wave of Sicily, <lb /> And sceptred Alexandria's captive Shore, <lb /> And sad Philippi red with
						Roman Gore. <lb /> Then, while the vaulted Skies loud Io's rend, <lb /> In golden Chains should loaded Monarchs bend; <lb /> And hoary
						Nile with pensive Aspect seem <lb /> To mourn the Glories of his sevenfold Stream: <lb /> The long-contended World's old Discords
						cease, <lb /> And Actium's Terrours grace the Pomp of Peace; <lb /> While Beaks, that late in fierce Encounter met, <lb /> Move thro'
						the sacred Way, &amp; vainly threat. <lb /> Thee too the Muse should consecrate to Fame,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.915tm" /><lb /> And
						with his Garlands weave thy ever-faithful Name. <lb /> But nor Callimachus' enervate Strain <lb /> May tell of Jove, &amp; Phlegra's
						blasted Plain; <lb /> Nor I with unaccustom'd Vigour trace <lb /> Back to its Source divine the Julian Race. <lb /> Sailors to tell of
						Seas &amp; Winds delight, <lb /> The Shepherd of his Flocks, the Soldier of the Fight, <lb /> A milder Warfare I in verse display,
						<lb /> Each in his proper Art should wast the Day: <lb /> Nor thou my gentle Calling disapprove, <lb /> To die is glorious in the Bed
						of Love. <lb /> Happy the Youth, &amp; not unknown to Fame, <lb /> Whose heart has never felt a second Flame. <lb /> Oh, might that
						envied Happiness be mine, <lb /> To Cynthia all my Wishes I confine <lb /> Or if, alas! it be my fate to try <lb /> Another Love, the
						quicker let me die.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.916tm" /><lb /> But she, the Mistress of my Faithful Breast, <lb /> Has oft the Charms of
						Constancy confest, <lb /> Condemns her fickle Sex'es fond Mistake, <lb /> And hates the Tale of Troy for Helen's Sake. <lb /> Me from
						myself the soft Enchantress stole, <lb /> Ah, let her ever my Desires controul, <lb /> Or if I fall, the Victim of her Scorn, <lb />
						From her loved Doors may my pale Coarse be born. <lb /> The Power of Herbs can other Harms remove, <lb /> And find a Cure for every
						Ill, but Love. <lb /> The Lemnian's Hurt Machaon could repair, <lb /> Heal the slow Chief, &amp; send again to War. <lb /> To Chiron
						Phœnix owed his long-lost Sight, <lb /> And Phœbus' Son restored Androgeon to the Light. <lb /> Here Skill is vain, even Magick here
						must fail, <lb /> The powerful Mixture, &amp; the Midnight Spell. <lb /> The Hand, that can my captive Heart release, <lb /> And to
						this Bosom give its wonted Peace, <lb /> May the long Thirst of Tantalus allay, <lb /> And drive th' infernal Vulture from his Prey.
						<lb /> For Ills unseen what remedy is found, <lb /> Or who can probe the undiscover'd Wound? <lb /> The Bed avails not, or the
						Leeche's care, <lb /> Nor changeing Skies can hurt, nor sultry Air, <lb /> 'Tis hard th' elusive Symptoms to explore, <lb /> Today the
						Lover walks, tomorrow is no more: <lb /> A Train of mourning Friends attend his Pall, <lb /> And wonder at the sudden Funeral. <lb />
						When then my Fates, that breath they gave, shall claim, <lb /> When the short Marble shall preserve a Name, <lb /> A little Verse, my
						All that shall remain; <lb /> Thy passing Courser's slacken'd Speed detain, <lb /> (Thou envied Honour of thy Poet's Days, <lb /> Of
						all our Youth th' Ambition &amp; the Praise!) <lb /> Then to my quiet Urn awhile draw near, <lb /> And say, (while o'er the place you
						drop a Tear) <lb /> Love &amp; the Fair were of his Life the Pride, <lb /> He lived, while She was kind, &amp; when she frown'd, he

				<p>Without any preface I come to your verses,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.918tm" /> which I read over and over with excessive pleasure, and
					which are at least as good as Propertius. I am only sorry you follow the blunders of Broukhusius,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.919tm" /> all
					whose insertions are nonsense. I have some objections to your antiquated words, and am also an enemy to Alexandrines; at least I do not
					like them in Elegy. I like your Elegy extremely, so extremely, that I long to shew you some little errors you are fallen into by
					following Broukhusius: for example, your thirty first lines are most intelligibly soft and pretty: but pray what sense do you affix to
					your six Broukhusian lines, that begin at happy youth and end at &#x2013; let me die? [...]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.920tm" /> Were I
					with you now, and Propertius with your verses lay upon the table between us, I could discuss this point in a moment; but there is
					nothing so tiresome as spinning out a criticism in a letter; doubts arise, and explanations follow, till there swells out at least a
					volume of undigested observations: and all because you are not with him whom you want to convince. Read only the letters between Pope
					and Cromwell<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.921tm" /> in proof of this; they dispute without end. Are you aware now that I have an interest all
					this while in banishing Criticism from our correspondence? Indeed I have; for I am going to write down a little Ode (if it deserves the
					name) for your perusal, which I am afraid will hardly stand that test. Nevertheless I leave you at your full liberty; so here it
					follows.</p>
				<q>
					<p>ODE.</p>
					<p>Dear Gray, that always in my heart <lb /> Possessest far the better part, <lb /> What mean these sudden blasts that rise <lb /> And
						drive the Zephyrs from the skies? <lb /> O join with mine thy tuneful lay, <lb /> And invocate the tardy May. </p>
					<p>Come, fairest Nymph, resume thy reign! <lb /> Bring all the Graces in thy train! <lb /> With balmy breath, and flowery tread, <lb />
						Rise from thy soft ambrosial bed; <lb /> Where, in elysian slumber bound, <lb /> Embow'ring myrtles veil thee round. </p>
					<p>Awake, in all thy glories drest, <lb /> Recall the Zephyrs from the west; <lb /> Restore the sun, revive the skies, <lb /> At mine,
						and Nature's call, arise! <lb /> Great Nature's self upbraids thy stay, <lb /> And misses her accustom'd May. </p>
					<p>See! all her works demand thy aid; <lb /> The labours of Pomona fade: <lb /> A plaint is heard from ev'ry tree; <lb /> Each budding
						flow'ret calls for thee; <lb /> The Birds forget to love and sing; <lb /> With storms alone the forests ring. </p>
					<p>Come then, with Pleasure at thy side, <lb /> Diffuse thy vernal spirit wide; <lb /> Create, where'er thou turn'st thy eye, <lb />
						Peace, Plenty, Love, and Harmony; <lb /> Till ev'ry being share its part, <lb /> And Heav'n and Earth be glad at heart.<anchor

				<p>I rejoice to see you putting up your prayers to the May: She cannot choose but come at such a call. It is as light and genteel as
					herself. You bid me find fault; I am afraid I cannot; however I will try. The first stanza (if what you say to me in it did not make me
					think it the best) I should call the worst of the five (except the fourth line). The two next are very picturesque, Miltonic, and
					musical; her bed is so soft and so snug that I long to lie with her. But those two lines 'Great Nature' are my favourites. The
					exclamation of the flowers is a little step too far.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.924tm" /> The last stanza is full as good as the second and
					third; the last line bold, but I think not too bold. Now, as to myself and my translation, pray do not call names. I never saw
					Broukhusius in my life. It is Scaliger<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.925tm" /> who attempted to range Propertius in order; who was, and still
					is, in sad condition. [...]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.926tm" /> You see, by what I sent you, that I converse, as usual, with none but the
					dead: They are my old friends, and almost make me long to be with them. You will not wonder therefore, that I, who live only in times
					past, am able to tell you no news of the present. I have finished the Peloponnesian war<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.927tm" /> much to my
					honour, and a tight conflict it was, I promise you. I have drank and sung with Anacreon for the last fortnight, and am now feeding
					sheep with Theocritus. Besides, to quit my figure, (because it is foolish) I have run over Pliny's Epistles and Martial <hi
						rend="italic">ἐκ</hi>
					<hi rend="italic">παρέργου</hi>; not to mention Petrarch, who, by the way, is sometimes very tender and natural. I must needs tell you
					three lines in Anacreon, where the expression seems to me inimitable. He is describing hair as he would have it painted.</p>

				<p>Your fragment is in Aulus Gellius;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.930tm" /> and both it and your Greek delicious. But why are you thus
					melancholy? I am so sorry for it, that you see I cannot forbear writing again the very first opportunity; though I have little to say,
					except to expostulate with you about it. I find you converse much with the dead, and I do not blame you for that; I converse with them
					too, though not indeed with the Greek. But I must condemn you for your longing to be with them. What, are there no joys among the
					living? I could almost cry out with Catullus<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.931tm" /> 'Alphene immemor, atque unanimis false sodalibus!' But to

					<salute>My Dear Sr</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Three Days ago, as I was in the Coffee-house very deep in Advertisements, a Servant came in, &amp; waked me (as I thought) with the
					Name of Mr Chute. for half a minute I was not sure, but that it was You transported into England by some strange Chance the Lord knows
					how; till he brought me to a Coach that seem'd to have lost its way by looking for a Needle in a Bottle of Hay, in it was a
						Lady,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.934tm" /> who said she was not You, but only a near relation, &amp; was so good to give me a Letter, with
					which I return'd to my Den in order to prey upon it. I had wrote to you but a few days ago,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.935tm" /> &amp; am
					glad of so good an Excuse to do it again, wch I may the better do, as my last was all out, &amp; nothing to the Purpose, being design'd
					for a certain Mr Chute at Rome, &amp; not him at Florence.</p>
				<p>I learn from it that I have been somewhat smarter, than I ought, but (to shew you with how little Malice) I protest I have not the
					least Idea what it was: my Memory would be better, did I read my own Letters so often, as I do yours. you must attribute it to a sort
					of kittenish Disposition, that scratches, where it means to caress; however I don't repent neither; if 'tis that, has made you write. I
					know, I need not ask pardon, for you have forgiven me: nay, I have a good Mind to complain myself. how could you say, that I design'd
					to hurt you, because I knew you could feel? I hate the thoughts of it, &amp; would not for the world wound any thing, that was
					sensible. 'tis true, I should be glad to scratch the Careless, or the Foolish, but no armour is so impenetrable, as Indifference &amp;
					Stupidity, and so I may keep my Claws to myself. for another Instance of the shortness of my Memory would you believe, I have so little
					knowledge of the Florentine History, as not to guess, who the Lady-Errant is you mention? sure it can't be the R:di<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.936tm" /> &amp; her faithful Swain, or may be M. G:di<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.937tm" /> &amp; the little Abbé. what you
					do there so long, I have no Conception. if you stay at other Places in proportion, I despair of ever seeing you again. 'tis true indeed
					Mr Mann is not every where. I am shock'd to think of his Sufferings,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.938tm" /> but he of all Men was born to
					suffer with a good Grace. he is a Stoick without knowing it, &amp; seems to think Pain a Pleasure: I am very sorry to complement him
					upon such an Occasion, &amp; wish with all my Heart he were not so pleased. I much fear his Books are gone already; but if not, to be
					sure he shall have Middleton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.939tm" /> &amp; the Sofa.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.940tm" /> it seems most people
					here are not such admirers of it, as I was: but I won't give up an inch of it for all that. did I tell you about Mr Garrick,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.941tm" /> that the Town are horn-mad after; there are a dozen Dukes of a night at Goodmans-fields<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.942tm" /> sometimes, &amp; yet I am stiff in the opposition.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.943tm" /> our fifth Opera was the
						Olympiade,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.944tm" /> in which they retain'd most of Pergolesi's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.945tm" /> Songs. &amp;
					yet 'tis gone already, as if it had been a poor thing of Galuppi's.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.946tm" /> two nights did I enjoy it all
					alone, snugg in a Nook in the Gallery, but found no one in those regions had ever heard of Pergolesi, nay, I heard several affirm it
					was a Composition of Pescetti's:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.947tm" /> now there is a 6th sprung up by the name of Cefalo &amp;
						Procri.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.948tm" /> my Lady of Queensbury<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.949tm" /> is come out against my Lady of
						Marlborough;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.950tm" /> &amp; she has her Spirit too, &amp; her Originality, but more of the Woman, I think,
					than t'other; as to the Facts it don't signify two pence, who's in the right; the manner of fighting, &amp; character of the Combatants
					is all: 'tis hoped old Sarah will at her again. a Play of Mr Glover's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.951tm" /> I am told, is prepareing for
					the stage call'd Boadicea:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.952tm" /> it is a fine Subject, but I have not an extreme Opinion of him. the
					Invalides at Chelsea intend to present Ranelagh-Gardens,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.953tm" /> as a Nusance,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.954tm"
					 /> for breaking their first Sleep with the sound of Fiddles: it opens, I think, tonight.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.955tm" /> Messieurs
					the Commons are to ballot for 7 Persons tomorrow, commission'd to state the publick accounts, &amp; they are to be such, who have no
					places, nor are anyways dependent on the King. the Committee have petition'd for all Papers relateing to the Convention:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.956tm" /> a bill has pass'd the lower House for indemnifying all, who might subject themselves to Penalties by
					revealing any transaction with regard to the Conduct of My Ld Orford,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.957tm" /> &amp; tomorrow the Lords are
					summon'd about it.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.958tm" /> the Wit of the times consists in Satyrical Prints, I believe, there have been some
					Hundreds within this Month; if you have any hopeful young Designer of Caricaturas, that has a political Turn, he may pick up a pretty
					Subsistance here: let him pass thro' Holland to improve his Taste by the way. we are all very sorry for poor Queen Hungary;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.959tm" /> but we know of a second Battle (wch perhaps you may never hear off, but from me) as how Prince
						Lobbycock<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.960tm" /> came up in the Nick of Time, &amp; cut 120,000 of'em all to pieces, &amp; how the King of
					Prussia narrowly scaped aboard a Ship, &amp; so got down the Dannub to Wolf-in-Bottle,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.961tm" /> where Mr
						Mallyboyce<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.962tm" /> lay incamp'd, &amp; how the Hannoverians with Prince Hissy-Castle<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.963tm" /> at their head, fell upon the French Mounseers, &amp; took him away with all his Treasure, among which is
					Pitt's Diamond,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.964tm" /> &amp; the Great Cistern.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.965tm" /> all this is firmly believed
					here, &amp; a vast deal more; upon the Strength of which we intend to declare War with France. </p>
				<p>You are so obligeing as to put me in mind of our last Years little expeditions;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.966tm" /> alas! Sr, they are
					past, &amp; how many Years will it be, at the rate you go on, before we can possibly renew them in this Country? in all probability I
					shall be gone first on a long Expedition to that undiscover'd Country, from whose bourn no Traveller returns; however (if I can) I will
					think of you, as I sail down the <hi rend="italic">River of Eternity.</hi> I can't help thinking, that I should find no difference
					almost between this world &amp; t'other (for I converse with none but the dead here) only indeed I should receive, nor write no more
					Letters (for the Post is not very well regulated) if you see the King of Naples, pray talk with him on this Subject, for I see he is
					upon Settleing one between his country &amp; Constantinople, &amp; I take this to be but a little more difficult.</p>
				<p>My Dab of Musick &amp; Prints you are very good to think of sending with your own; to which I will add a farther Trouble by desireing
					you to send me some of the Roots of a certain Flower, wch I have seen at Florence, it is a huge white Hyacynth tinged with Pink (Mr M:
					knows what I mean, by that same token that they grow sometimes in the fat Gerina's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.967tm" />
					<hi rend="italic">Boosom</hi>) I mean, if they bear a reasonable Price, wch you will judge of for me: but don't give yourself any pains
						about<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.968tm" /> it, for if they are not easily had, &amp; at an easy Rate, I am not at all eager for them: do
					you talk of <hi rend="italic">strumming</hi>? ohime! who have not seen the face of a <hi rend="italic">Haspical,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.969tm" /> since I came home; no; I have hanged up my Harp on the Willows; however I look at my Musick now &amp;

					Noise of many-stringed Instruments. Adieu! dear Sr,</p>

				<p>Mine, you are to know, is a white Melancholy, or rather Leucocholy for the most part; which though it seldom laughs or dances, nor
					ever amounts to what one calls Joy or Pleasure, yet is a good easy sort of a state, and ça ne laisse que de s'amuser. The only fault of
					it is insipidity; which is apt now and then to give a sort of Ennui, which makes one form certain little wishes that signify nothing.
					But there is another sort, black indeed, which I have now and then felt, that has somewhat in it like Tertullian's rule of faith, Credo
					quia impossibile est; for it believes, nay, is sure of every thing that is unlikely, so it be but frightful; and, on the other hand,
					excludes and shuts its eyes to the most possible hopes, and every thing that is pleasurable; from this the Lord deliver us! for none
					but he and sunshiny weather can do it. In hopes of enjoying this kind of weather, I am going into the country<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.974tm" /> for a few weeks, but shall be never the nearer any society; so, if you have any charity, you will continue
					to write. My life is like Harry the fourth's supper of Hens. 'Poulets a la broche, Poulets en Ragôut, Poulets en Hâchis, Poulets en
						Fricasées.'<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.975tm" /> Reading here, Reading there; nothing but books with different sauces. Do not let me lose
					my desert then; for though that be Reading too, yet it has a very different flavour. The May seems to be come since your invitation;
					and I propose to bask in her beams and dress me in her roses.</p>

				<p>Here follows also the beginning of an Heroic Epistle; but you must give me leave to tell my own story first, because Historians
					differ. Massinissa was the son of Gala King of the Massyli; and, when very young at the head of his father's army, gave a most signal
					overthrow to Syphax, King of the Masæsylians, then an ally of the Romans. Soon after Asdrubal, son of Gisgo the Carthaginian General,
					gave the beautiful Sophonisba, his daughter, in marriage to the young prince. But this marriage was not consummated on account of
					Massinissa's being obliged to hasten into Spain, there to command his father's troops, who were auxiliaries of the Carthaginians. Their
					affairs at this time began to be in a bad condition; and they thought it might be greatly for their interest, if they could bring over
					Syphax to themselves. This in time they actually effected; and to strengthen their new alliance, commanded Asdrubal to give his
					daughter to Syphax. (It is probable their ingratitude to Massinissa arose from the great change of affairs, which had happened among
					the Massylians during his absence; for his father and uncle were dead, and a distant relation of the royal family had usurped the
					throne.) Sophonisba was accordingly married to Syphax: and Massinissa, enraged at the affront, became a friend to the Romans. They
					drove the Carthaginians before them out of Spain, and carried the war into Africa, defeated Syphax, and took him prisoner; upon which
					Cirtha (his capital) opened her gates to Lælius and Massinissa. The rest of the affair, the marriage, and the sending of poison, every
					body knows.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.978tm" /> This is partly taken from Livy,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.979tm" /> and partly from
						Appian.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.980tm" />

				<p>This melancholy day is the first that I have had any notice of my Loss in poor West, and that only by so unexpected a Means as some

					indeed some reason to suspect it some days since from receiving a letter of my own<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.984tm" /> to him sent back

					knowing how to direct, they must imagine I was his friend. I am a fool indeed to be surprizd at meeting with Brutishness or want of
					Thought among Mankind; what I would desire is, that you would have the goodness to tell me, what you know of his death, more

					<salute>My dear Wharton</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>It is a long Time, since I ought to have return'd you my Thanks for the Pleasure of your Letter; I should say, the Prodigy of your
					Letter, for such a Thing has not happen'd above twice within this last Age to mortal Man, &amp; no one here can conceive what it may
					portend. Mr Trollope,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1031tm" /> I suppose, has told you, how I was employed a part of the Time; how by my own
					indefatigable Application for these ten Years past, &amp; by the Care &amp; Vigilance of that worthy Magistrate, the Man-in-Blew<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1032tm" /> (who, I'll assure you, has not spared his Labour, nor could have done more for his own Son) I am got half
					way to the Top of Jurisprudence,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1033tm" /> &amp; bid as fair as another Body to open a case of Impotency<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1034tm" /> with all Decency &amp; Circumspection. you see my Ambition: I do not doubt, but some 30 Years hence I shall
					convince the World &amp; You, that I am a very pretty young Fellow, &amp; may come to shine in a Profession perhaps the noblest in the
					World, next to Man-Midwifery. as for yours: if your Distemper &amp; You can but agree about going to London, I may reasonably expect in
					a much shorter Time to see you in your three-corner'd Villa, doing the honours of a well-furnish'd Table with as much Dignity, as rich
					a Mien, &amp; as capacious a Belly as Dr Mead.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1035tm" /> methinks I see Dr Askew<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1036tm"
					 /> at the lower End of it, lost in Admiration of your goodly Person &amp; Parts, cramming down his Envy (for it will rise) with the
					Wing of a Pheasant, &amp; drowning it in neat Burgundy. but not to tempt your Asthma too much with such a Prospect, I should think you
					might be almost as happy, &amp; as great as this, even in the Country. but you know best; &amp; I should be sorry to say anything, that
					might stop you in the Career of Glory. far be it from me to hamper the Wheels of your gilded Chariot. go on, Sr Thomas; &amp; when you
					die (for even Physicians must die) may the Faculty in Warwick Lane<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1037tm" /> erect your statue in Sr John
						Cutler's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1038tm" /> own Niche.</p>
				<p>As to Cambridge it is, as it was, for all the World; &amp; the People are, as they were; &amp; Mr Trollope is as he was, that is,
					half ill, half well. I wish with all my Heart they were all better, but what can one do? there is no News, only I think I heard a
					Whisper, as if the Vice-Chancellour<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1039tm" /> should be with Child: (but I beg you not to mention this, for I
					may come into trouble about it) there is some Suspicion, that the Professor of Mathematicks<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1040tm" /> had a
					Hand in the thing. Dr Dickens<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1041tm" /> says the University will be obliged to keep it, as it was got, in
					Magistratu.</p>
				<p>I was going to tell you, how sorry I am for your Illness. but, I hope, it is too late to be sorry now: I can only say, that I really
					was very sorry. may you live a hundred Christmases, &amp; eat as many Collars of Brawn stuck with Rosemary. Adieu, I am sincerely Yours </p>

				<p>You write so feelingly to little Mr Brown,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1045tm" /> &amp; represent your abandon'd Condition in Terms so
					touching, that, what Gratitude could not effect in several Months, Compassion has brought about in a few Days, &amp; broke that strong
					Attachment, or rather Allegiance, wch I &amp; all here owe to our sovereign Lady &amp; Mistress, the President of Presidents, &amp;
					Head of Heads (if I may be permitted to pronounce her Name, that ineffable Octogrammaton) the Power of LAZINESS.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1046tm" /> you must know she had been pleased to appoint me (in Preference to so many old Servants of hers, who had
					spent their whole Lives in qualifying themselves for the Office) Grand Picker of Straws, &amp; Push-Pin-Player in ordinary to her
					Supinity (for that is her Title) the first is much in the Nature of Ld President of the Council, &amp; the other, like the
					Groom-Porter, only without the Profit. but, as they are both Things of very great Honour in this Country, I consider'd with myself the
					Load of Envy attending such great Charges, &amp; besides (between you &amp; I) I found myself unable to support the Fatigue of keeping
					up the Appearance, that Persons of such Dignity must do, so I thought proper to decline it, &amp; excused myself as well as I could:
					however as you see such an Affair must take up a good deal of Time, &amp; it has always been the Policy of this Court to proceed
					slowly, like the Imperial, &amp; that of Spain, in the Dispatch of Business; so that you will the easier forgive me, if I have not
					answer'd your Letter before.</p>
				<p>You desire to know, it seems, what Character the Poem<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1047tm" /> of your young Friend bears here. I wonder to
					hear you ask the Opinion of a Nation, where those who pretend to judge, don't judge at all; &amp; the rest (the wiser Part) wait to
					catch the Judgement of the World immediately above them, that is, Dick's Coffee-House,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1048tm" /> &amp; the
						Rainbow:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1049tm" /> so that the readier Way would be to ask Mrs This &amp; Mrs T'other, that keeps the Bar
					there. however to shew you I'm a Judge, as well as my Countrymen, tho' I have rather turn'd it over, than read it, (but no matter: no
					more have they) it seems to me above the middleing, &amp; now &amp; then (but for a little while) rises even to the best, particularly
					in Description. it is often obscure, &amp; even unintelligible, &amp; too much infected with the Hutchinson-Jargon.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1050tm" /> in short it's great fault is that it was publish'd at least 9 Years too early.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1051tm" /> and so methinks in a few Words, a la Mode du Temple,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1052tm" /> I have very pertly
					dispatch'd what perhaps may for several Years have employd a very ingenious Man worth 50 of myself. here is a small poem, call'd the
						Enthusiast,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1053tm" /> wch is all pure Description, &amp; as they tell me by the same Hand. is it so, or not?
					Item, a more bulky one upon Health, wrote by a Physician:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1054tm" /> do you know him? Master Tommy
						Lucretius<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1055tm" /> (since you are so good to enquire after the Child) is but a puleing Chitt yet, not a bit
					grown to speak off, I believe, poor Thing! it has got the Worms, that will carry it off at last. oh Lord! I forgot to tell you, that Mr
						Trollope<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1056tm" /> &amp; I are in a course of Tar-Water,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1057tm" /> he for his Present,
					and I for my future Distempers: if you think it will kill me, send away a Man &amp; Horse directly, for I drink like a Fish. I should
					be glad to know how your [ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1058tm" /> goes on, &amp; give you Joy of it.</p>
				<p>You are much in the Right to have a Taste for Socrates, he was a divine Man. I must tell you by Way of the News of the Place, that
					the other Day Mr Fraigneau<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1059tm" /> (entering upon his Professorship) made an Apology for him an Hour long in
					the Schools, &amp; all the World, except Trinity-College, brought in Socrates Guilty. Adieu, Dr Sir, &amp; believe me</p>

					Sunday some Hours alone, when he inform'd me of abundance of Anecdotes much to my Satisfaction, &amp; in short open'd (I really

				<p>You are so good to enquire after my usual Time of comeing to Town; it is at a Season, when even You, the perpetual Friend of London,
					will I fear hardly be in it, the Middle of June: and I commonly return hither in September, a Month, when I may more probably find you
					at home.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1083tm" /> I do not imagine that any Thing farther can be done with Mr Turner,<anchor

						Master<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1085tm" />&amp; his Party of Fellows, among wch he himself has been reckon'd latterly: but, I know, it
					must be from some other Influence, than that of the Master merely, if he vote with them; wch if Mr Brudenel<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1086tm" /> could stand, might very likely be made Use of (as he is nearly related to several People of Condition) but
					he is disqualified at present in every Sense. 'tis likely indeed he is intended for next Year, &amp; Mr Turner has had some Application
					made already, by his knowing anything about him; but he mistakes the Time.</p>
				<p>Our Defeat to be sure is a rueful Affair for the Honour of the Troops,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1087tm" /> but the Duke<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1088tm" /> is gone, it seems, with the Rapidity of a Cannon-Bullet to undefeat us again. the Common-People in Town at

					we are supposed to get from Books, is so faintly impress'd, that we talk of War, Famine, &amp; Pestilence with no more Apprehension,
					than of a broken Head, or of a Coach overturn'd between York &amp; Edinburgh. I heard three People, sensible middle-aged Men (when the
					Scotch were said to be at Stamford, &amp; actually were at Derby<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1089tm" />) talking of hireing a Chaise to go
					to Caxton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1090tm" /> (a Place in the high Road) to see the Pretender &amp; the Highlanders, as they passed.</p>
				<p>I can say no more for Mr Pope, (for what You keep in Reserve may be worse than all the Rest) it is natural to wish the finest Writer,
					one of them, we ever had should be an honest Man. it is for the Interest even of that Virtue, whose Friend he profess'd himself, &amp;
					whose Beauties he sung, that he should not be found a dirty Animal.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1091tm" /> but however this is Mr
						Warburton's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1092tm" /> Business, not mine, who may scribble his Pen to the Stumps &amp; all in vain, if these
					Facts are so. it is not from what he told me about himself<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1093tm" /> that I thought well of him, but from a
					Humanity &amp; Goodness of Heart, ay, &amp; Greatness of Mind, that runs thro his private Correspondence, not less apparent than are a
					thousand little Vanities &amp; Weaknesses mixed with those good Qualities, for no body ever took him for a Philosopher.</p>
				<p>If you know anything of Mr Mann's State of Health &amp; Happiness, or the Motions of Mr Chute<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1094tm" />
					homewards, it will be a particular Favour to inform me of them, as I have not heard this half year from them.</p>

					<salute>My Dear Wharton</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I am just returned hither<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1104tm" /> from Town, where I have past better than a Fortnight, (including an
					Excursion that I made to Hampton Court, Richmond, Greenwich &amp; other Places) &amp; am happily met by a letter from You, [one from
						Tuthill],<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1105tm" /> &amp; another from Trollope.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1106tm" /> as I only run over Dr
						Andrew's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1107tm" /> Answers hastily in a Coffee House, all I could judge was that they seem'd very unfavourable
					on the whole to our Cause,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1108tm" /> &amp; threw every thing into the Hands of a Visitour, for wch Reason I
					thought they might have been conceal'd, till the Attorney-General's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1109tm" /> Opinion arrived, wch will perhaps
					raise the Spirits of such, as the other may have damp'd a little; or leave Room at least to doubt whether the Matter be so clear on the
					Master's Side as Andrew would have it. You can't suppose, that I was in the least uneasy about Mr Brown's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1110tm" /> Fortitude, who wants nothing, but a Foot in height &amp; his own Hair, to make him a little old Roman: with
					two dozen such I should not hesitate to face an Army of Heads, tho' they were all as tall as Dr Adams.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1111tm"
					 /> I only wish every body may continue in as good a Disposition as they were; &amp; imagine, if possible, Roger<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1112tm" /> will be Fool enough to keep them so. I saw Trollope for about an Hour in London; &amp; imagineing he could
					not be left in the dark as to your Consultations, I mention'd, that I had cast an Eye over Andrew's Paper, &amp; that it was not so
					favourable as we hoped. he spoke however with Horrour of going to Law; with great Passion of the Master; &amp; with Pleasure of himself
					for quitting a Place, where he had not found a Minute's Ease in I know not how long: yet I perceive his Thoughts run on nothing else,
					&amp; he trembled while he spoke. he writes to me here on the same Subject; &amp; after abusing Roger, he adds, Whartoni rubro hæc
					subscribe libello.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1113tm" />
				</p>
				<p>My Evenings have been chiefly spent at Ranelagh &amp; Vaux-Hall, several of my Mornings, or rather Noons, in Arlington-Street,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1114tm" /> &amp; the rest at the Tryal of the Lords.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1115tm" /> the first Day I was not there,
					&amp; only saw the Ld High-Steward's Parade in going: the second &amp; third <anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1116tm" /> [... Peers were all in
					their Robes ... by their wearing Bag-Wigs &amp; Hats instead of Coronets.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1117tm" /> My Lord H: Steward<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1118tm2" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1118tm1" /> was the least part]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1118tm" /> of the Shew, as he wore only his Baron's
					Robe, &amp; was always asking the Heralds what he should do next, &amp; bowing or smileing about to his Acquaintance. as to his Speech
					you see it; People hold it very cheap, tho' several Incorrectnesses have been alter'd in the printed Copy.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1119tm" /> Kilmarnoch<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1120tm" /> spoke in Mitigation of his Crime near half an Hour with a
					decent Courage, &amp; in a strong, but pathetic, Voice. his Figure would prejudice people in his Favour being tall &amp; genteel: he is
					upwards of 40, but to the Eye not above 35 Years of Age. what he said appears to less Advantage, when read. Cromartie<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1121tm" /> (who is about the same Age a Man of lower Stature, but much like a Gentleman) was sinking into the Earth
					with Grief &amp; Dejection. with Eyes cast down &amp; a Voice so low, that no one heard a Syllable, that did not sit close to the Bar,
					he made a short Speech to raise Compassion. it is now, I see, printed; &amp; is reckon'd extremely fine. I believe, you will think it
					touching &amp; well-expressed: if there be any Meanness in it, it is lost in that Sorrow he gives us for so numerous &amp; helpless a
					Family. Lady-Cromartie<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1122tm" /> (who is said to have drawn her Husband into these Circumstances) was at
						Leicester-House<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1123tm" /> on Wednesday with four of her Children; the Princess saw her, &amp; made no other
					answer than by bringing in her own Children &amp; placeing them by her; wch (if true) is one of the prettiest Things I ever heard. she
					was also at the Duke's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1124tm" /> who refused to admit her: but she waited till he came to his Coach &amp;
					threw herself at his Knees, while her Children hung upon him, till he promised her all his Interest could do; &amp; before on several
					Occasions he has been heard to speak very mildly of Cromartie, &amp; very severely of Kilmarnoch. so if any be spared, it will probably
					be the former, tho' he had a pension of 600£ a-Year from the Government, &amp; the Order for giveing Quarter to no Englishman was found
					in his Pocket.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1125tm" /> as to Balmerino<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1126tm" /> he never had any Hopes from the
					Beginning: he is an old soldier-like Man of a vulgar Manner &amp; Aspect, speaks the broadest Scotch, &amp; shews an Intrepidity, that
					some ascribe to real Courage, &amp; some to Brandy. </p>
				<p>You have heard perhaps, that the first Day (while the Peers were adjourned to consider of his Plea, &amp; he left alone for an Hour
					&amp; half in the Bar) he diverted himself with the Ax, that stood by him, played with its Tassels &amp; tryed the Edge with his
					Finger: &amp; some Lord, as he passed by him, saying he was surprised to hear him alledge anything so frivolous, &amp; that could not
					possibly do him the least Service: he answer'd, that as there were so many Ladies present, he thought it would be uncivil to give them
					no Amusement. the D: of Argyle<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1127tm" /> telling him how sorry &amp; how astonish'd he was to see him engaged
					in such a Cause. My Lord (says he) for the two Kings &amp; their Rights I cared not a Farthing, wch prevailed: but I was starveing;
					&amp; by God if Mahomet had set up his Standard in the Highlands, I had been a good Musselman for Bread, &amp; stuck close to the
					Party, for I must eat. the Sollicitor-General<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1128tm" /> came up to speak to him too; &amp; he turns about to
					old Williamson.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1129tm" /> Who is that Lawyer, that talks to me? My Ld, it is Mr Murray. Ha! Mr Murray, my good
					Friend (says he, &amp; shook him by the Hand) &amp; how does your good Mother?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1130tm" /> oh, she was of
					admirable Service to us; we should have done nothing without her in Perthshire. he recommends (he says) his Peggy<anchor

					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1133tm" />[I have been diverted with an Account of old Lovat<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1134tm2" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1134tm1" /> in his Confinement at]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1134tm" /> Edinburgh. there was a Captain Maggett,
					that is obliged to lie in the Room every Night with him. when first he was introduced to him, he made him come to his Bedside where he
					lay in a hundred flannel Wastcoats and a furr'd Night-gown, took him in his Arms, &amp; gave him a long Embrace, that absolutely
					suffocated him. he will speak nothing but French; insists upon it, that Maggett is a Frenchman &amp; calls him, Mon cher Capitaine
					Magot (You know <hi rend="italic">Magot</hi> is a Monkey) at his Head lie two Highland Women &amp; at his feet two Highland Men. by his
					Bedside is a Close-Stool to wch he rises two or three times in a Night, &amp; always says, Ah, mon cher Capitaine Magot! vous
					m'excuserez, mais la Nature demande que je chie! he is to be impeached by the House of Commons, because not being actually in Arms, it
					would otherwise be necessary, that the Jury of Inverness should find a Bill of Indictment against him, wch it is very sure they would
					not do. when the Duke return'd to Edinburgh they refused to admit Kingston's light Horse &amp; talked of their Privileges. but they
					came in Sword in Hand, &amp; replied, that when the Pretender was at their Gates, they had said nothing of their Privileges. the Duke
					rested some Hours there, but refused to see the Magistracy.</p>
				<p>I believe you may think it full Time, that I close my Budget of Stories: Mr. W: I have seen a good deal, &amp; shall do a good deal
					more, I suppose, for he is looking for a House somewhere about Windsor<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1135tm" /> dureing the Summer. all is
					mighty free, &amp; even friendly. more than one could expect. you remember a Paper in the Museum on Message-Cards<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1136tm" /> wch he told me was Fielding's, &amp; asked my Opinion about: it was his own, &amp; so was the Advertisement
					on Good-Breeding,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1137tm" /> that made us laugh so. Mr. A:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1138tm" /> I have had several
					Conversations with, &amp; do really believe he shews himself to me such as he really is: I don't tell you, I like him ever the better
					for it; but that may be my Fault, not his. the Pelhams<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1139tm" /> lie very hard at his Stomach: he is not 40
					yet, but he is 31, he says, &amp; thinks it his Duty to be married.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1140tm" /> one Thing of that Kind is just
					broke off; she had 12000[£ in]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1141tm" /> her own Hands. this a profound Secret, but I not conceiving that he
					told it m[e as] such, happen'd to tell it to Stonhewer,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1142tm" /> who told it Lyne,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1143tm" /> who told it Asht: again, all i[n the] Space of three Hours. whereby I incurr'd a Scolding; so pray don't
					let me fall under [a] second, &amp; lose all my Hopes of riseing in the Church. he is still, as I said, resolute to m[arry] out of
					Hand; only two things he is terrified at, lest she should not breed, &amp; lest she should love him: I comforted him by saying, there
					was no Danger of either.</p>
				<p>the Muse, I doubt, is gone,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1144tm" /> &amp; has left me in far worse Company: if she returns, you will hear
					of her. You see I have left no Room for a Catalogue,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1145tm" /> wch is a Sort of Policy, for its hardly possible
					my Memory should supply one: I will try by next Time, wch will be soon, if I hear from you. if your Curiosity require any more

				<p> What can one say to these Things? if it had been in the Power of Lawyers to interpret into Common-Sense Statutes made by old Monks,
					or Monk-directed old Women, we might have hoped for a more favourable Answer to our Queries?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1150tm" /> as it

					 /> had some Place to rest the Sole of his Foot in; &amp; I flatter myself You will never omitt anything in your Power to support his
					little Interest among a People, with whom You first raised it. I would gladly know the Time of your Audit, for I would be at Cambridge
					by that Time, if I could. Mr. W:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1152tm" /> has taken a House in Windsor &amp; I see him usually once a Week;
					but I think, that will hardly detain me beyond the Time I proposed to myself. he is at present gone to Town to perform the disagreeable
					Task of presenting &amp; introduceing about a young Florentine, the Marquis Rinuccini,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1153tm" /> who comes
					recommended to him. the D: is here at his Lodge<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1154tm" /> with three Whores &amp; three Aid-de Camps; &amp; the
					Country swarms with People. he goes to Races, &amp; they make a Ring about him, as at a Bear-baiting; and no Wonder, for they do the
					same at Vaux-hall and Ranelagh. at this last, somebody was telling me they heard a Man lamenting to some Women of his Acquaintance,
					&amp; saying, how he had been up close to him, &amp; he never repented of anything so much in his Life, as that he did not touch him. </p>
				<p>I am not altogether of your Opinion, as to your Historical Consolation in time of Trouble. a calm Melancholy it may produce, a
					stiller Sort of Despair (&amp; that only in some Circumstances &amp; on some Constitutions) but I doubt no real Content or Comfort can
					ever arise in the human Mind, but from Hope. Old Balmerino when he had read his Paper to the People, pull'd off his Spectacles, spit
					upon his Handkerchief, &amp; wiped them clean for the Use of his Posterity; &amp; that is the last Page of his History. have you seen
					Hogarth's Print of Ld Lovat?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1155tm" /> it is admirable.</p>
				<p>I can not help thinking if I had been near you, I should have represented the Horror of the Thing in such a Light, as that you should
					never have become a Prey to Mr Davie.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1156tm" /> I know, that he'll get you up in a Corner some Day, &amp; pick
					your bones &amp; John<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1157tm" /> will find nothing of you, but such a little Heap, as a Cat that is a good
					Mouser leaves, the Head &amp; the Tail piled together. my Concern for you produced a Vision, not such a one as you read in the
					Spectators, but actually a Dream. I thought I was in t'other World and confined in a little Apartment much like a Cellar, enlighten'd
					by one Rush-Candle that burn'd blue. on each Side of me sate (for my Sins) Mr Davie &amp; my friend Mr A:;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1158tm" /> they bow'd continually &amp; smiled in my Face, and while one fill'd me out very bitter Tea, the other
					sweetened it with a vast deal of brown Sugar: alltogether it much resembled Syrup of Buckthorn. in the corner sat [Tuthill]<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1159tm" /> very melancholy, in Expectation of the Tea-Leaves.</p>
				<p>I take it very ill you should have been in the twentieth Year of the War, &amp; yet say nothing of the Retreat from before
						Syracuse:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1160tm" /> is it, or is it not the finest Thing you ever read in your Life? and how does Xenophon, or
					Plutarch agree with you? for my Part I read Aristotle; his Poeticks, Politicks, and Morals, tho' I don't well know, wch is which. in
					the first Place he is the hardest Author by far I ever meddled with. then he has a dry Conciseness, that makes one imagine one is
					perusing a Table of Contents rather than a Book: it tasts for all the World like chop'd Hay, or rather like chop'd Logick; for he has a
					violent Affection to that Art, being in some Sort his own Invention; so that he often loses himself in little trifleing Distinctions
					&amp; verbal Niceties, &amp; what is worse leaves you to extricate yourself as you can. thirdly he has suffer'd vastly by the
					Transcribblers, as all Authors of great Brevity necessarily must. fourthly and lastly he has abundance of fine uncommon Things, wch
					make him well worth the Pains he gives one. you see what you have to expect. this &amp; a few autumnal Verses<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1161tm" /> are my Entertainments dureing the Fall of the Leaf. notwithstanding wch my Time lies heavy on my Hands,
					&amp; I want to be at home again.</p>
				<p>I have just received a Visit from A:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1162tm" /> he tells me we have certainly [a Peace]<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1163tm" /> with Spain very far advanced, wch 'tis likely will produce a general one<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1164tm" />
					&amp; that the King, when he has finish'd it, is determined to pass the rest of his Days at Windsor. wch to me is strange, however it
					comes from the Pelhamites. I send you here a Page of Books:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1165tm" /> enough I imagine to chuse out of,
					considering the State of your Coll: Finances. the best Editions of ancient Authors should be the first Things, I reckon, in a Library:

				<p>My God! Mr Chute in England?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1169tm" /> what &amp; have you seen him? and did he say nothing to you? not a
					Word of me! such was my Conversation, when I first heard News so surprising, with a Person,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1170tm" /> that
					(when I reflect) it is indeed no great Wonder You did not much interrogate concerning me, as you knew nothing of what has past of
						late.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1171tm" />
				</p>
				<p>But let me ask you yourself, have a few Years totally erased me from your Memory? You are generous enough perhaps to forget all the
					Obligations I have to you, but is it Generosity to forget the Person you have obliged too? while I remember myself, I can not but
					remember you; &amp; consequently can not but wonder, when I find no where one Line, one Syllable, to tell me you are arrived. I will
					venture to say, there is no body in England however nearly connected with you, that has seen you with more real Joy &amp; Affection
					than I shall. You are, it seems, gone into the Country whither (had I any Reason to think you wish'd to see me) I should immediately
					have follow'd you: as it is, I am returning to Cambridge; but with Intention to come back to Town again, whenever you do; if you will
					let me know the Time, &amp; Place. </p>
				<p>I readily set Mr Wh:d<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1172tm" /> free from all Imputations. he is a fine young Personage in a Coat all over
					Spangles just come over from the Tour of Europe to take Possession, &amp; be married:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1173tm" /> &amp;
					consequently can't be supposed to think of any Thing, or remember any body. but You &#x2014;! however I don't altogether clear him. he
					might have said something to one, who remembers him when he was but a Pout.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1174tm" /> nevertheless I desire my
					hearty Gratulations to him, &amp; say I wish him more Spangles, &amp; more Estates, &amp; more Wives.</p>

				<p>You have not then forgot me, &amp; I shall see you again: it suffices, &amp; there needed no other Excuse. I loved You too well not
					to forgive you without a Reason; but I could not but be sorry for myself. </p>
				<p>You are lazy (you say) &amp; listless &amp; gouty &amp; old, &amp; vex'd and perplex'd: I am all that (the Gout excepted) &amp; many
					Things more, that I hope you never will be: so that what you tell me on that Head est trop flateux<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1184tm" />
					pour moi: our Imperfections may at least excuse, &amp; perhaps recommend us to one another: methinks I can readily pardon Sickness
					&amp; Age &amp; Vexation for all the Depredations they make within &amp; without, when I think they make us better Friends &amp; better
					Men, wch I am persuaded is often the Case. I am very sure, I have seen the best-temper'd generous tender young Creatures in the World,
					that would have been very glad to be sorry for People they liked, when under any Pain, and could not; merely for Want of knowing
					rightly, what it was, themselves.</p>
				<p>I find Mr Walpole then made some Mention of me to you. yes, we are together again. it is about a Year, I believe, since he wrote to
					me to offer it, &amp; there has been (particularly of late) in Appearance the same Kindness &amp; Confidence almost as of old. what
					were his Motives I can not yet guess: what were mine, you will imagine, &amp; perhaps blame me.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1185tm" />
					however as yet I neither repent, nor rejoice overmuch: but I am pleased. he is full, I assure you, of your Panegyric. never any body
					had half so much Wit as Mr Chute<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1186tm" /> (wch is saying every thing with him, you know) &amp; Mr W.d is the
					finest young Man, that ever was imported.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1187tm" /> I hope to embrace this fine Man (if I can) &amp; thank him
					heartily for being my Advocate, tho' in vain: he is a good Creature, &amp; I am not sure but I shall be tempted to eat a Wing of him
					with Sellery-Sauce<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1188tm" /> &#x2013; I am interrupted. whenever I know of your Time, I will be in Town

					<salute>My Dear Sr</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I found (as soon as I got hither) a very kind Letter from Mr Chute, from whence I have Reason to hope we may all meet in Town about a
					Week hence. You have probably been there, since I left you, &amp; consequently have seen the Mr Barry<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1191tm" />
					you desired some Account of: yet as I am not certain of this, &amp; should be glad to know whether we agree about him; I will
					nevertheless tell you what he is, &amp; the Impression he made upon me. he is upwards of six Foot in Height, well &amp; proportionably
					made, treads well, &amp; knows what to do with his Limbs; in short a noble graceful Figure: I can say nothing of his Face, but that it
					was all Black, with a wide Mouth &amp; good Eyes. his Voice is of a clear &amp; pleasing Tone, something like Delane's,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1192tm" /> but not so deep-mouth'd, not so like a Passing Bell. when high strained, it is apt to crack a little, &amp;
					be hoarse: but in its common Pitch, &amp; when it sinks into any softer Passion, particularly expressive &amp; touching. in the first
					Scenes, especially where he recounts to the Senate the Progress of his Love, &amp; the Means he used to win Desdemona, he was quite
					mistaken, &amp; I took a Pique against him: instead of a Cool Narration he flew into a Rant of Voice &amp; Action, as tho' he were
					relating the Circumstances of a Battle that was fought yesterday. I expected nothing more from him, but was deceived: in the Scenes of
					Rage &amp; Jealousy he was seldom inferior to Quin:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1193tm" /> > in the Parts of Tenderness &amp; Sorrow far
					above him. these latter seem to be his peculiarly: his Action is not very various, but rarely improper, or without Dignity: &amp; some
					of his Attitudes are really fine. he is not perfect to be sure; but I think may make a better Player than any now on the Stage in a
					little while. however to see a Man in one Character, &amp; but once, is not sufficient: so I rather ask your Opinion by this, than give
					you mine.</p>
				<p>I annex (as you desired) another Ode.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1194tm" /> all it pretends to with you is, that it is mine, &amp; that
					you never saw it before, &amp; that it is not so long as t'other.</p>
				<q>
					<p>Lo, where the rosie-bosom'd Hours, <lb /> Fair Venus' Train, appear, <lb /> Disclose the long-expecting Flowers, <lb /> And wake the
						purple Year! <lb /> The Attic Warbler pours her Throat <lb /> Responsive to the Cuckow's Note, <lb /> The untaught Harmony of Spring:
						<lb /> While whisp'ring Pleasure as they fly <lb /> Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue Sky <lb /> Their gather'd Fragrance fling </p>
					<p>Where'er the Oak's thick Branches stretch <lb /> A broader browner Shade; <lb /> Where'er the rude &amp; moss-grown Beech <lb />
						O'ercanopies the Glade; <note place="margin" n="*">&#x2013;a Bank <lb /> Oercanopied with luscious Woodbine <lb /> Shakesp: <title>Mids: Night's
								Dream</title><anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1195tm" /></note><lb /> Beside some Water's rushy Brink <lb /> With me the Muse shall sit, &amp; think
						<lb /> (At Ease reclined in rustic State) <lb /> How vain the Ardour of the Crowd, <lb /> How low, how indigent the Proud, <lb /> How
						little are the Great!<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1196tm" />
					</p>
					<p>Still is the toiling Hand of Care: <lb /> The panting Herds repose. <lb /> Yet hark, how thro' the peopled Air <lb /> The busy
						Murmur glows! <lb /> The Insect-Youth are on the Wing <lb /> Eager to tast the honied Spring, <lb /> And float amid the liquid Noon:
							<note place="margin" n="&#8224;">Nare per æstatem liquidam. Virg:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1197tm" /></note><lb /> Some lightly o'er the Current
						skim, <lb /> Some shew their gayly-gilded Trim <lb /> Quick-glanceing to the Sun. </p>
					<p>To Contemplation's sober Eye <lb /> Such is the Race of Man: <lb /> And they that creep, &amp; they that fly, <lb /> Shall end where
						they began. <lb /> Alike the Busy &amp; the Gay <lb /> But flutter thro' Life's little Day, <lb /> In Fortune's varying Colours drest:
						<lb /> Brush'd by the Hand of rough Mischance, <lb /> Or chill'd by Age, their airy Dance <lb /> They leave, in Dust to rest. </p>
					<p>Methinks I hear in Accents low <lb /> The sportive Kind reply, <lb /> Poor Moralist! &amp; what art Thou? <lb /> A solitary Fly!
						<lb /> Thy Joys no glittering Female meets, <lb /> No Hive hast thou of hoarded Sweets, <lb /> No painted Plumage to display: <lb />
						On hasty Wings thy Youth is flown; <lb /> Thy Sun is set; thy Spring is gone: <lb /> We frolick, while 'tis May. </p>

				<p> It is doubtless highly reasonable, that two young Foreigners come into so distant a Country to acquaint themselves with strange
					Things should have some Time allowed them to take a View of the King (God bless him) &amp; the Ministry, &amp; the Theatres, &amp;
					Westminster Abbey &amp; the Lyons,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1201tm" /> &amp; such other Curiosities of the Capital City: you civilly call
					them Dissipations; but to me they appear Employments of a very serious Nature, as they enlarge the Mind, give a great Insight into the
					Nature &amp; Genius of a People, keep the Spirits in an agreeable Agitation, and (like the True Artificial Spirit of Lavender)
					amazingly fortify &amp; corroborate the whole nervous System. but as all Things sooner or later must pass away, &amp; there is a
					certain Period, when (by the Rules of Proportion) one is to grow weary of every Thing: I may hope at length a Season will arrive, when
					you will be tired of forgetting me. 'tis true you have a long Journey to make first, a vast Series of Sights to pass thro'. let me see!
					you are at Lady Brown<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1202tm" /> already. I have set a Time, when I may say, oh! he is now got to the Waxwork in
						Fleetstreet:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1203tm" /> there is nothing more but Cupid's Paradise,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1204tm" /> &amp; the

				<p>I would make you an Excuse (as indeed I ought) if they were a Sort of Thing I ever gave any Credit to myself in these Cases, but I
					know they are never true. nothing so silly as Indolence, when it hopes to disguise itself: every one knows it by it's Saunter; as they
					do his Majesty (God bless him) at a Masquerade by the Firmness of his Tread, &amp; the Elevation of his Chin. however somewhat I had to
					say, that has a little Shadow of Reason in it. I have been in Town (I suppose you know) flaunting about at publick Places of all kinds
					with my two Italianized Friends.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1212tm" /> the World itself has some Attraction in it to a Solitary of six
					Years standing; &amp; agreeable well-meaning People of Sense (thank Heaven there are so few of them) are my peculiar Magnet. it is no
					Wonder then, if I felt some Reluctance at parting with them so soon; or if my Spirits, when I return'd back to my Cell, should sink for
					a time, not indeed to Storm &amp; Tempest, but a good deal below Changeable. besides Seneca says (and my Pitch of Philosophy does not
					pretend to be much above Seneca)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1213tm" /> Nunquam mores, quos extuli, refero. aliquid ex eo, quod composui,
					turbatur: aliquid ex his, quæ fugavi, redit. and it will happen to such as we, mere Imps of Science. well it may, when Wisdom herself
					is forced often&#x2013;in sweet retired Solitude </p>
				<q>
					<p>To plume her Feathers, &amp; let grow her Wings,<lb /> That in the various Bustle of Resort <lb /> Were all too ruffled &amp;
						sometimes impair'd.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1214tm" />
					</p>
				</q>
				<p>It is a foolish Thing, that one can't only not live as one pleases, but where &amp; with whom one pleases, without Money. Swift
					somewhere says, that Money is Liberty;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1215tm" /> &amp; I fear money is Friendship too &amp; Society, &amp;
					almost every external Blessing. it is a great tho' ill-natured, Comfort to see most of those, who have it in Plenty, without Pleasure,
					without Liberty, &amp; without Friends.</p>
				<p>Mr Brown (who I assure you holds up his Head &amp; his Spirits very notably) will give you an Account of your College Proceedings, if
					they may be so call'd, where nothing proceeds at all. only the last Week Roger<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1216tm" /> was so wise to declare
					ex motu proprio, that he took Mr Delaval<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1217tm" /> (who is now a Fell: Commoner) into his own Tuition. this
					raised the dirty Spirit of his Friend, Mr May<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1218tm" /> (now Tutor in Francis's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1219tm"
					 /> Room) against him, &amp; even gentle Mr Peele,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1220tm" /> (who never acts but in Conjunction) together with
					Mr Brown (who pretended to be mighty angry, tho' in reality heartily glad) and they all came to an Eclaircissement in the Parlour. they
					abused him pretty reasonably, &amp; it ended in threatening them as usual with a Visitor. in short they are all as rude as may be,
					leave him at Table by himself, never go into the Parlour, till he comes out; or if he enters, when they are there, continue sitting
					even in his own Magisterial Chair. May bickers with him publickly about twenty paltry Matters, &amp; Roger t'other Day told him he was
					impertinent. what would you have more? you see they do as one would wish. if you were here all would be right. I am surprised not to
					hear you mention, when that will be; pray give an Account of yourself.</p>

					<p>P:S: When I went to Town Part of my Errand was to sell a little Stock I had, to pay off Birkett's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1221tm" />
						old Debt now at Xmas, but it was so low, I should have lost near 12 per Cent, &amp; so it continues. if you think of being here near
						that Time, &amp; find it not inconvenient to you to lend me 40£, you will save me the Money I mention. (as I remember you once
						offer'd) but if any Inconvenience attend it, you must imagine I don't by any Means desire it; &amp; you need not be at the Trouble of
						any Excuse, as I well know, nothing but the not being able would hinder your doing it immediately. let me know, because otherwise I
						have another Journey to make to Town. </p>

					his prayers regularly and devoutly, had a profound reverence for the clergy, and firmly believed everything that was the fashion in
					those days?</p>
				<p>When you have done impeaching my lord Lovat,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1227tm" /> I hope to hear <hi rend="italic">de vos

				<p>It surprises me to hear you talk of so much Business, &amp; the Uncertainty of your Return; &amp; what not? sure you will find Time
					to give me an Account of your Transactions, &amp; your Intentions. for your Ears, don't let 'em think of marrying you! for I know if

					guilty of) you will never go abroad, never read any thing more, but Farriery-Books, and Justice-Books, &amp; so either die of a
					Consumption; or live on, &amp; grow fat, wch is worse. for me &amp; my Retirement (for you are in the Right to despise my Dissipation
					de quinze Jours)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1235tm" /> we are in the midst of Diog: Laertius &amp; his Philosophers, as a Proœmium to the
					Series of their Works, &amp; those of all the Poets &amp; Orators, that lived before Philip of Macedon's Death: &amp; we have made a
					great Chronological Table<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1236tm" /> with our own Hands, the Wonder &amp; Amazement of Mr Brown; not so much for
					Publick Events, tho' these too have a Column assign'd them, but rather in a literary Way, to compare the Times of all great Men, their
					Writeings &amp; Transactions. it begins at the 30th Olympiad, &amp; is already brought down to the 113th; that is, 332 Years. our only

					only the Fellows, as I told you, are grown pretty rudish to their Sovereign in general,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1241tm" /> for Francis
					is now departed. poor dear Mr Delaval<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1242tm" /> indeed has had a little Misfortune. Intelligence was brought,
					that he had with him a certain Gentlewoman properly call'd Nell Burnet, (but whose Nom de Guerre was Capt:n Hargraves) in an Officer's
					Habit, whom he had carried all about to see Chappels &amp; Libraries, &amp; make Visits in the Face of Day. the Master raised his
					Posse-Comitatus in Order to search his Chambers, &amp; after long Feeling &amp; Snuffleing about the Bed, he declared they had
					certainly been there. wch was very true, &amp; the Captain was then locked up in a Cupboard there, while his Lover stood below in Order
					to convey him out at Window, when all was over. however they took Care not to discover her, tho' the Master affirm'd; had he but caught
					her, he would soon have known, whether it was a Man, or a Woman. upon this Mr Del: was desired to cut out his Name, &amp; did so: next
					Day Dr L: repented, &amp; wrote a Paper to testify he never knew any Hurt of him, wch he brought to Dr Whaley,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1243tm" /> who would have directly admitted him here, if Stuart<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1244tm" /> had not absolutely
					refused. he was offer'd about at several Colleges, but in vain. then Dr L: call[ed]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1245tm" /> two Meetings to
					get him re-admitted there, but every one was inexorable &amp; so he has lost his Pupil,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1246tm" /> who is gone,
					I suppose, to lie with his Aunt Price.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1247tm" /> Trollope continues in Dev'reux-Court:<anchor

						xml:id="id_tg1a.1251tm" /> both Writers of Odes? it is odd enough, but each is the half of a considerable Man, &amp; one the
					Counter-Part of the other. the first has but little Invention, very poetical choice of Expression, &amp; a good Ear. the second, a fine
					Fancy, model'd upon the Antique, a bad Ear, great Variety of Words, &amp; Images with no Choice at all. they both deserve to last some
					Years, but will not.</p>

				<p>It is doubtless an encouragement to continue writing to you, when you tell me you answer me with pleasure:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1254tm" /> I have another reason which would make me very copious, had I anything to say; it is, that I write to you
					with equal pleasure, though not with equal spirits, nor with like plenty of materials: please to subtract then so much for spirit, and
					so much for matter; and you will find me, I hope, neither so slow, nor so short, as I might otherwise seem. Besides, I had a mind to
					send you the remainder of Agrippina, that was lost in a wilderness of papers. Certainly you do her too much honour: she seemed to me to
					talk like an <hi rend="italic">Oldboy,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1255tm" /> all in figures and mere poetry, instead of nature and the language of real passion. Do you remember
						<hi rend="italic">Approchez-vous, </hi>

					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1256tm" /> &#x2014;Who would not rather have thought of that half line than all Mr. Rowe's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1257tm" /> flowers of eloquence? However, you will find the remainder here at the end in an outrageous long speech: it
					was begun above four years ago (it is a misfortune you know my age, else I might have added), when I was very young. Poor West put a
					stop to that tragic torrent<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1258tm" /> he saw breaking in upon him:&#x2013;have a care, I warn you, not to set
					open the flood-gate again, lest it should drown you and me and the bishop<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1259tm" /> and all.</p>
				<p>I am very sorry to hear you treat philosophy and her followers like a parcel of monks and hermits, and think myself obliged to
					vindicate a profession I honour, bien que je n'en tienne pas boutique (as mad. Sevigné says).<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1260tm" /> The
					first man that ever bore the name, if you remember, used to say, that life was like the Olympic games<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1261tm" />
					(the greatest public assembly of his age and country), where some came to show their strength and agility of body, as the champions;
					others, as the musicians, orators, poets, and historians, to show their excellence in those arts; the traders, to get money; and the
					better sort, to enjoy the spectacle, and judge of all these. They did not then run away from society for fear of its temptations: they
					passed their days in the midst of it: conversation was their business: they cultivated the arts of persuasion, on purpose to show men
					it was their interest, as well as their duty, not to be foolish, and false, and unjust; and that too in many instances with success:
					which is not very strange; for they showed by their life that their lessons were not impracticable; and that pleasures were no
					temptations, but to such as wanted a clear perception of the pains annexed to them. But I have done preaching à la Grecque. Mr.
						Ratcliffe<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1262tm" /> made a shift to behave very rationally without their instructions, at a season which they
					took a great deal of pains to fortify themselves and others against: one would not desire to lose one's head with a better grace. I am
					particularly satisfied with the humanity of that last embrace to all the people about him. Sure it must be somewhat embarrassing to die
					before so much good company!</p>
				<p>You need not fear but posterity will be ever glad to know the absurdity of their ancestors: the foolish will be glad to know they
					were as foolish as they, and the wise will be glad to find themselves wiser. You will please all the world then; and if you recount
					miracles you will be believed so much the sooner.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1263tm" /> We are pleased when we wonder; and we believe
					because we are pleased. Folly and wisdom, and wonder and pleasure, join with me in desiring you would continue to entertain them:
					refuse us if you can.</p>

				<p>I had been absent from this Place a few Days, &amp; at my Return found Cibber's Book<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1265tm" /> upon my Table:
					I return you my Thanks for it, &amp; have already run over a considerable Part, for who could resist Mrs Lætitia Pilkington's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1266tm" /> Recommendation? (by the Way is there any such Gentlewoman, or has somebody put on the Style of a
					scribbleing Woman's Panegyric to deceive &amp; laugh at Colley?) he seems to me full as pert &amp; as dull as usual. there are whole
					Pages of Common-Place Stuff, that for Stupidity might have been wrote by Dr Waterland<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1267tm" /> or any other
					grave Divine, did not the flirting saucy Phrase give them at a Distance an Air of Youth &amp; Gayety. it is very true, he is often in
					the right with regard to Tully's Weaknesses; but was there any one that did not see them? those, I imagine, that would find a Man after
					God's own Heart, are no more likely to trust the Doctor's Recommendation, than the Player's. &amp; as to Reason &amp; Truth: would they
					know their own Faces, do you think? if they look'd in the Glass, &amp; saw themselves so bedizen'd in tatter'd Fringe &amp; tarnish'd
					Lace, in French Jewels, &amp; dirty Furbelows, the frippery of a Stroller's Wardrobe? </p>
				<p>Litterature (to take it in its most comprehensive Sense, &amp; include every Thing, that requires Invention, or Judgement, or barely
					Application &amp; Industry) seems indeed drawing apace to its Dissolution; &amp; remarkably since the Beginning of the War. I should be
					glad to know why, if any one will tell me. for I believe there may be natural Reasons discoverable enough without haveing Recourse to
					St John, or St Alexander's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1268tm" /> Revelations. I remember to have read Mr Spence's pretty Book,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1269tm" /> tho' (as he then had not been at Rome for the last Time) it must have increased greatly since that in Bulk.
					if you ask me what I read; I protest I don't remember one Syllable; but only in general, that they were the best-bred Sort of Men in
					the World, just the Kind of <hi rend="italic">Frinds</hi> one would wish to meet in a fine Summer's Evening, if one wish'd to meet any
					at all. the Heads &amp; Tails of the Dialogues, publish'd separate in 16mo, would make the sweetest Reading in Natiur for young
					Gentlemen of Family &amp; Fortune, that are learning to dance: I am told, he has put his little Picture before it.<anchor

						Agripp:na<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1271tm" /> can stay very well, she thanks you; &amp; be damn'd at Leisure: I hope in God you have not
					mention'd, or shew'd to any Body that Scene (for trusting in it's Badness, I forgot to caution you concerning it) but I heard the other
					Day, that I was writeing a Play, &amp; was told the Name of it, wch no body here could know, I'm sure. the Employment you propose to

				<p>I have abundance of Thanks to return You for the Entertainment Mr Spence's Book has given me, wch I have almost run over already;
					&amp; I much fear (see what it is to make a Figure) the Breadth of the Margin, &amp; the Neatness of the Prints, wch are better done
					than one could expect, have prevail'd upon me to like it far better, than I did in Manuscript. for I think, it is not the very genteel
					Deportment of Polymetis, nor the lively Wit of Mysagetes, that have at all corrupted me. </p>
				<p>There is one fundamental Fault, from whence most of the little Faults throughout the whole arise. he professes to neglect the Greek
					Writers, who could have given him more Instruction on the very Heads he professes to treat, than all the others put together. who does
					not know, that upon the Latine, the Sabine, &amp; Hetruscan Mythology (wch probably might themselves at a remoter Period of Time owe
					their Origin to Greece too) the Romans ingrafted almost the whole Religion of Greece to make what is call'd their own? it would be hard
					to find any one Circumstance, that is properly of their Invention. in the ruder Days of the Republick the picturesque Part of their
					Religion (wch is the Province he has chose, &amp; would be thought to confine himself too) was probably borrowed entirely from the
					Tuscans, who, as a wealthy &amp; tradeing People, may be well supposed, &amp; indeed are known, to have had the Arts flourishing in a
					considerable Degree among them. what could inform him here, but Dionysius Halic: (who expressly treats of those Times with great
					Curiosity &amp; Industry) &amp; the Remains of the first Roman Writers? the former he has neglected as a Greek; &amp; the latter he
					says were but little acquainted with the Arts, &amp; consequently are but of little Authority. in the better Ages, when every Temple
					&amp; publick Building in Rome was peopled with imported Deities &amp; Hero's, &amp; when all the Artists of Reputation they made Use
					of were Greeks, what Wonder, if their Eyes grew familiarised to Grecian Forms &amp; Habits (especially in a Matter of this kind, where
					so much depends upon the Imagination) &amp; if those Figures introduced with them a Belief of such Fables, as first gave them Being,
					&amp; dress'd them out in their various Attributes. it was natural then; &amp; (I should think) necessary, to go to the Source itself,
					the Greek Accounts of their own Religion. but, to say the Truth, I suspect he was little conversant in those Books &amp; that Language,
					for he rarely quotes any but Lucian, an Author that falls in every Bodie's Way, &amp; who lived at the very extremity of that Period he
					has set to his Enquiries, later than any of the Poets he has meddled with, &amp; for that Reason ought to have been regarded, as but an
					indifferent Authority, especially being a Syrian too. as he says himself; his Book, I think, is rather a Beginning than a perfect Work;
					but a Beginning at the wrong End: for if any body should finish it by enquireing into the Greek Mythology, as he proposes; it will be
					necessary to read it backward. </p>
				<p>There are several little Neglects, that any one might have told him of, I minded in reading it hastily, as P: 311, a Discourse about
					Orange-Tree's occasion'd by Virgil's, inter odoratum lauri nemus.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1291tm" /> where he fancies the Roman Laurus
					to be our Laurel: tho' undoubtedly the Bay-tree, wch is <hi rend="italic">odoratum,</hi> &amp; (I believe) still call'd Lauro, or
					Alloro, at Rome. &amp; that the Pomum<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1292tm" /> Medicum in the Georgick is the Orange: tho' Theophrastus,
					whence Virgil borrow'd it, or even Pliny whom he himself quotes, might convince him, it is the Cedrato, wch he has often tasted at
					Florence. P: 144. is an Account of Domenichin's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1293tm" /> Cardinal Virtues, &amp; a Fling at the Jesuits;
					neither of wch belong to them. the Painting is in a Church of the Barnabiti, dedicated to St Carlo Borroméo, whose Motto is Humilitas.
					P: 151. in a Note he says, the old Romans did not <hi rend="italic">regard Fortune as a Deity.</hi> tho' Serv: Tullius (whom she was
					said to be in Love with; nay, there was actually an Affair between them) founded her Temple in Foro Boario. by the Way her Worship was
					Greek; &amp; this King was educated in the Family of Tarquin: Priscus, whose Father was a Corinthian. so it is easy to conceive, how
					early the Religion of Rome might be mixed with that of Greece .. &amp;c: &amp;c:</p>
				<p>Dr Midd:n has sent me to day a Book on the Roman Senate,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1294tm" /> the Substance of a Dispute between Ld
						Hervey<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1295tm" /> &amp; Him, tho' it never <hi rend="italic">interrupted their Friendship,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1296tm" /> he says, &amp; I dare say not ... Mrs Læt: Pilkington is a Name under certain recommendatory Verses
					in the Front of Cibber's Book,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1297tm" /> that seem designed to laugh at him. they were in a loose Sheet, not
					sow'd in. how does your Comedy<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1298tm" /> succeed? I am told, very well.</p>

				<p>As one ought to be particularly careful to avoid blunders in a compliment of condolence, it would be a sensible satisfaction to me
					(before I testify my sorrow, and the sincere part I take in your misfortune) to know for certain, who it is I lament. I knew Zara and
						Selima,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1300tm" /> (Selima, was it? or Fatima) or rather I knew them both together; for I cannot justly say
					which was which. Then as to your handsome Cat, the name you distinguish her by, I am no less at a loss, as well knowing one's handsome
					cat is always the cat one likes best; or, if one be alive and the other dead, it is usually the latter that is the handsomest. Besides,
					if the point were never so clear, I hope you do not think me so ill-bred or so imprudent as to forfeit all my interest in the surviver:
					Oh no! I would rather seem to mistake, and imagine to be sure it must be the tabby one that had met with this sad accident. Till this
					affair is a little better determined, you will excuse me if I do not begin to cry:</p>
				<q>
					<p>'Tempus inane peto, requiem, spatiumque doloris.'<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1301tm" />

				<p>Which interval is the more convenient, as it gives time to rejoice with you on your new honors.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1302tm" />

				<p>You ask me, what I would answer in case any one should ask me a certain Question concerning You.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1309tm" /> In
					my Conscience, I should say, Yes; &amp; the readier as I have had a Revelation about it: 'twas in a Dream that told me you had taken a
					Fancy to one of the four last Letters in the Alphabet. I think it can't be X, nor Z (for I know of no female Zeno, or Xenophon) it may
					be Y perhaps, but I have somehow a secret Partiality for W.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1310tm" /> am I near it, or no? by this Time I
					suppose, 'tis almost a done Thing. there is no struggling with Destiny, so I acquiesce. thus far only I should be glad to know with
					Certainty, whither it be likely [you]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1311tm" /> should continue in Statu Quo,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1312tm" />
					till the Commencement<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1313tm2" /> (wch I dont conceive) for o[therwise]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1313tm" /> I
					should think it rather better for [T:]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1314tm" /> to give up his Pretensions with a good Grace, than to wait the
					Pleasure of those dirty Cubs, who will infallibly prefer the first that offers of their own People. but I submit this to your
					Judgement, who (as you first made him a Competitor) ought to determine at what Time he may most decently withdraw. I have some
					Uneasiness too on Brown's Account, who has sacrificed all his Interests with so much Frankness, &amp; is still so resolute to do every
					Thing for us without Reserve, that I should see him with great Concern under the Paw of a fell Visitor, &amp; exposed to the Insolence
					of that old Rascal, the Master. Tr:pe<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1315tm" /> (if you remember) would engage himself no longer than the end
					of this Year? 'tis true he has never said any thing since, tending that Way; but he is not unlikely to remember it at a proper Time.
					and as to Sm:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1316tm" /> he must necessarily be abîmé, in a very short Time. his Debts daily increase (you
					remember the State they were in, when you left us) Addison,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1317tm" /> I know, wrote smartly to him last Week;
					but it has had no Effect, that signifies. only I observe he takes Hartshorn from Morning to Night lately: in the mean time he is
					amuseing himself with a Comedy<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1318tm" /> of his own Writeing, wch he makes all the Boys of his Acquaintance
					act, &amp; intends to borrow the Zodiack Room,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1319tm" /> &amp; have it performed publickly.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1320tm" /> our Friend Lawman, the mad Attorney, is his Copyist;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1321tm" /> &amp; truly the
					Author himself is to the full as mad as he. his Piece (he says) is inimitable, true Sterling Wit, &amp; Humour by God; &amp; he can't
					hear the Prologue without being ready to die with Laughter. he acts five Parts himself, &amp; is only sorry, he can't do all the rest.
					he has also advertised a Collection of Odes;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1322tm" /> &amp; for his Vanity &amp; Faculty of Lyeing, they are
					come to their full Maturity. all this, you see, must come to a Jayl, or Bedlam,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1323tm" /> &amp; that without
					any help, almost without Pity. by the Way now I talk of a Jayl, please to let me know, when &amp; where you would have me pay my own

				</p>
				<p>Chapman<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1325tm" /> (I suppose you know) is warm in his Mastership. soon after his Accession I was to see him:
					there was a very brillant<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1326tm" /> (Cambridge) Assembly, Middleton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1327tm" />
						Rutherforth,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1328tm" /> Heberden,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1329tm" /> Robinson,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1330tm" />
						Coventry,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1331tm" /> &amp; various others. he did the Honours with a great Deal of comical Dignity, assisted by
					a Bedmaker in greasy Leather Breeches &amp; a Livery, &amp; now he is gone to Town to get Preferment. but what you'll wonder at &amp;
					what delights me, Coventry is his particular Confident (tho' very disagreeably to himself) he can't open his Door, but he finds the
					Master there, who comes to set<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1332tm" /> with him at all Hours, &amp; brings his Works with him, for he is
					writeing a great Book on the Roman Constitution. well, upon the Strength of this I too am grown very great with Coventry, &amp; to say
					the Truth (bateing his Nose,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1333tm" /> &amp; another Circumstance, wch is nothing to me) he is the best Sort of
					Man in this Place. M:n<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1334tm" /> has publish'd a small Oct:vo on the Roman Senate, well enough, but nothing of
					very great Consequence, &amp; is now gone to be inducted into a Sine-Cure (not £100 a-Year)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1335tm" /> that Sr
					J: Frederick<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1336tm" /> gave him. what's worse, for the Sake of this little nasty Thing (I am told) he is
					determined to suppress a Work,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1337tm" /> that would have made a great Noise, or publish it all mangled &amp;
					disfigured, &amp; this when he has (I am assured) near 700£ a-year of his own already, &amp; might live independent, &amp; easy, and
					speak his Mind in the Face of the whole World Clerical and Laïcal. such a Passion have some Men to lick the Dust, &amp; be trampled
					upon. the Fellow-Com[mo]ners<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1338tm" /> (the Bucks) are run mad, they set Women upon their Heads in the Streets
					at [noon]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1339tm2" /> day, break open Shops, game in the Coffee-houses on Sundays, &amp; in short act after my
						[own]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1339tm" /> Heart.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1340tm" />
				</p>
				<p>My Works are not so considerable as you imagine. I have read Pausania[s and Athe]næus<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1341tm" /> all thro',
					&amp; Æschylus again. I am now in Pindar<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1342tm" /> &amp; Lysias: for I take Verse and Prose together, like
					Bread &amp; Cheese. the Chronology<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1343tm" /> is growing daily. the most noble of my Performances latterly is a
					Pôme on the uncommon Death of Mr W:s<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1344tm" /> Cat. wch being of a proper Size &amp; Subject for a Gentleman in
					your Condition to peruse (besides that I flatter myself, Miss &#x2014; will give her Judgement upon it too), I herewith send you. it

				<p>When I received the testimonial of so many considerable personages to adorn the second page of my next edition, and (adding them to
					the Testimonium Autoris de seipso) do relish and enjoy all the conscious pleasure resulting from six pennyworths of glory, I cannot but
					close my satisfaction with a sigh for the fate of my fellow-labourer in poetry, the unfortunate Mr. Golding,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1378tm" /> cut off in the flower or rather the bud of his honours, who had he survived but a fortnight more, might
					have been by your kind offices<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1379tm" /> as much delighted with himself, as I. Windsor and Eton might have gone
					down to posterity together, perhaps appeared in the same volume,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1380tm" /> like Philips<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1381tm" /> and Smith,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1382tm" /> and we might have set at once to Mr. Pond<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1383tm" /> for the frontispiece, but these, alas! are vain reflections. To return to myself. Nay! but you are such a
					wit! sure the gentlemen an't so good, are they? and don't you play upon the word. I promise you, few take to it here at all,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1384tm" /> which is a good sign (for I never knew anything liked here, that ever proved to be so any where else,) it
					is said to be mine, but I strenuously deny it, and so do all that are in the secret, so that nobody knows what to think; a few only of
					King's College gave me the lie, but I hope to demolish them; for if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't know, who should? Tell Mr. Chute, I
					would not have served him so, for any brother in Christendom, and am very angry. To make my peace with the noble youth<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1385tm" /> you mention, I send you a Poem that I am sure they will read (as well as they can) a masterpiece&#x2013;it
					is said, being an admirable improvement on that beautiful piece called Pugna Porcorum,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1386tm" /> which begins <q>
						<p>Plangite<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1387tm" /> porcelli Porcorum pigra propago;</p>

					</p>
					<p>Great D draws near&#x2013;the Dutchess sure is come, <lb /> Open the doors of the withdrawing-room; <lb /> Her daughters deck'd most
						daintily I see, <lb /> The Dowager grows a perfect double D. <lb /> E enters next, and with her Eve appears. <lb /> Not like yon
						Dowager deprest with years; <lb /> What Ease and Elegance her person grace, <lb /> Bright beaming, as the Evening-star, her face;
						<lb /> Queen Esther next&#x2013;how fair e'en after death, <lb /> Then one faint glimpse of Queen Elizabeth; <lb /> No more, our
						Esthers now are nought but Hetties, <lb /> Elizabeths all dwindled into Betties;<lb /> In vain you think to find them under E, <lb />
						They're all diverted into H and B. <lb /> F follows fast the fair&#x2013;and in his rear, <lb /> See Folly, Fashion, Foppery, straight
						appear, <lb /> All with fantastic clews, fantastic clothes, <lb /> With Fans and Flounces, Fringe and Furbelows. <lb /> Here
						Grub-street Geese presume to joke and jeer, <lb /> All, all, but Grannam Osborne's Gazetteer.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1390tm" />
						<lb /> High heaves his hugeness H, methinks we see, <lb /> Henry the Eighth's most monstrous majesty, <lb /> But why on such <hi
							rend="italic">mock</hi> grandeur should we dwell,<lb /> H mounts to Heaven, and H descends to Hell. </p>
					<p />
					<p> As H the Hebrew found, so I the Jew, <lb /> See Isaac, Joseph, Jacob, pass in view; <lb /> The walls of old Jerusalem appear,
						<lb /> See Israel, and all Judah thronging there. </p>
					<p />
					<p> P pokes his head out, yet has not a pain; <lb /> Like Punch, he peeps, but soon pops in again; <lb /> Pleased with his Pranks, the
						Pisgys call him Puck, <lb /> Mortals he loves to prick, and pinch, and pluck; <lb /> Now a pert Prig, he perks upon your face, <lb />
						Now peers, pores, ponders, with profound grimace, <lb /> Now a proud Prince, in pompous Purple drest, <lb /> And now a Player, a Peer,
						a Pimp, or Priest; <lb /> A Pea, a Pin, in a perpetual round, <lb /> Now seems a Penny, and now shews a Pound; <lb /> Like Perch or
						Pike, in Pond you see him come, <lb /> He in plantations hangs like Pear or Plum, <lb /> Pippin or Peach; then perches on the spray,
						<lb /> In form of Parrot, Pye, or Popinjay. <lb /> P, Proteus-like all tricks, all shapes can shew, <lb /> The Pleasantest Person in
						the Christ-Cross row. </p>
					<p />
					<p> As K a King, Q represents a Queen, <lb /> And seems small difference the sounds between; <lb /> K, as a man, with hoarser accent
						speaks, <lb /> In shriller notes Q like a female squeaks; <lb /> Behold K struts, as might a King become, <lb /> Q draws her train
						along the Drawing-room, <lb /> Slow follow all the quality of State, <lb /> Queer Queensbury<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1391tm" /> only
						does refuse to wait.</p>
					<p> </p>
					<p> Thus great R reigns in town, while different far, <lb /> Rests in retirement, <hi rend="italic">little</hi> Rural R;<lb /> Remote
						from cities lives in lone Retreat, <lb /> With Rooks and Rabbit burrows round his seat&#x2013; <lb /> S, sails the Swan slow down the
						Silver stream. </p>
					<p> </p>
					<p> So big with Weddings, waddles W, <lb /> And brings all Womankind before your view; <lb /> A Wench, a Wife, a Widow, and a
						W&#x2013;e, <lb /> With Woe behind, and Wantonness before. </p>

				<p> When you and Mr Chute can get the remainder of <hi rend="italic">Mariane,</hi>

				<p>It is a misfortune to me to be at a distance from both of you at present.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1406tm" /> A letter can give one so
					little idea of such matters! [ ] I always believed well of his heart and temper, and would gladly do so still. If they are as they
					should be, I should have expected every thing from such an explanation; for it is a tenet with me (a simple one, you'll perhaps say),
					that if ever two people, who love one another, come to breaking, it is for want of a timely eclaircissement, a full and precise one,
					without witnesses or mediators, and without reserving any one disagreeable circumstance for the mind to brood upon in silence.</p>
				<p>I am not totally of your mind as to Mr. Lyttleton's Elegy,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1407tm" /> though I love kids and fawns<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1408tm" /> as little as you do. If it were all like the fourth stanza,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1409tm" /> I should be
					excessively pleased. Nature and sorrow, and tenderness, are the true genius of such things; and something of these I find in several
					parts of it (not in the orange-tree):<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1410tm" /> poetical ornaments are foreign to the purpose; for they only
					show a man is not sorry;&#x2013;and devotion worse; for it teaches him, that he ought not to be sorry, which is all the pleasure of the
					thing. I beg leave to turn your weathercock the contrary way. Your Epistle<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1411tm" /> I have not seen a great
					while, and doctor M.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1412tm" /> is not in the way to give me a sight of it: but I remember enough to be sure all
					the world will be pleased with it, even with all its <hi rend="italic">faults upon its head,</hi> if you don't care to mend them. I
					would try to do it myself (however hazardous), rather than it should remain unpublished. As to my Eton Ode,<anchor

				<p>I rejoice to hear you are safe arrived, tho' drawn by <hi rend="italic">four wild Horses,</hi> like People one reads of in the Book

					Spirits &amp; Hobgoblins about you, &amp; Pleasure at one Entrance quite shut out; you must so much the more set open all the other
					Avenues to admit it, open your Folio's, open your De L'Isle,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1419tm" /> &amp; take a Prospect of that World, wch
					the cruel Architect has hid from your corporeal Eyes, &amp; confined 'em to the narrow Contemplation of your own <hi rend="italic"
						>Backside,</hi> &amp; Kitchen Garden. Mr Keene<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1420tm" /> has been here, but is now gone to Town for a little
					While, &amp; returns to pass the Winter with us. we are tolerably gracious, &amp; he speaks mighty well of you: but when I look upon
					his countenance &amp; his Ways, I can never think of bestowing [Tuthill]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1421tm" /> upon him (tho' it were never
					so advantagious, &amp; they both had a Mind to it) and so I have said nothing to either of them. I found, he had no Hopes of your
						Petition;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1422tm" /> &amp; believe, you are right in thinking no farther of it. your Mention of Mr Vane,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1423tm" /> reminds me of poor Smart<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1424tm" /> (not that I, or any other Mortal, pity him)
					about three Weeks ago he was arrested here at the Suit of a Taylor in London for a Debt of about 50£ of three Years standing. the
					College had about 28£ due to him in their Hands, the rest (to hinder him from going to the Castle,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1425tm" />
					for he could not raise a Shilling) Brown, May, &amp; Peele,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1426tm" /> lent him upon his Note. upon this he
					remain'd confined to his Room, lest his Creditors here should snap him; &amp; the Fellows went round to make out a List of his Debts,
					wch amount in Cambridge to above 350£. that they might come the readier to some Composition, he was advised to go off in the Night,
					&amp; lie hid somewhere or other. he has done so, &amp; this has made the Creditors agree to an Assignment of 50£ per ann: out of his
					Income, wch is above 140£, if he lives at Cambridge (not else). but I am apprehensive, if this come to the Ears of Mr Vane he may take
					away the 40£ hitherto allowed him by the Duke of Cleveland;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1427tm" /> for before all this (last Summer) I know
					they talk'd of doing so, as Mr Smart (they said) was settled in the World. if you found an Opportunity, possibly you might hinder this
					(wch would totally ruin him now) by representing his Absurdity in the best Light it will bear: but at the same Time they should make
					this a Condition of its Continuance; that he live in the College, soberly, &amp; within Bounds, for that upon any Information to the
					Contrary it shall be absolutely stop'd. this would be doing him a real Service, tho' against the Grain: yet I must own, if you heard
					all his Lies, Impertinence, &amp; Ingratitude in this Affair, it would perhaps quite set you against him, as it has his only Friend (Mr
						Addison)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1428tm" /> totally. &amp; yet one would try to save him, for Drunkenness is one great Source of all
					this, &amp; he may change it. I would not tell this Matter in the North,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1429tm" /> were I you, till I found it
					was known by other Means. we have had an Opinion from the Attor:ny General<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1430tm" /> in a manner directly
					contrary to the former. he does not seem to have been clear then; so that he may possibly not be so now. the Kings-Bench (he says) can
					take no Cognizance of it; the Visitor must do all, &amp; he is the Vice-Chancellor<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1431tm" /> by K: James's
					Charter, wch is good. this is sad indeed, &amp; the Fellows, before they acquiesce in it, seem desirous of consulting Dr Lee,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1432tm" /> who is well acquainted with College-Matters.</p>
				<p>Have you seen Lyttelton's Monody<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1433tm" /> on his Wife's Death? there are Parts of it too stiff &amp;
					poetical; but others truly tender &amp; elegiac, as one would wish. Dodsley is publishing three Miscellaneous Volumes;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1434tm" /> some new, many that have been already printed. Lyttelton, Nugent,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1435tm" /> and G:
						West<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1436tm" /> have given him several Things of theirs. Mr W: has given him three Odes of mine<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1437tm" /> (wch you have seen before) &amp; one of Mr West's (my Friend, who is dead) wch in Spite of the Subject is
					excellent: it is on the late Queen's Death.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1438tm" /> there is a Mr Archibald Bower,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1439tm" /> a Scotchman bred in Italy, Professour in three Universities there, &amp; of the Inquisition. he was

				<p>I am obliged to you for Mr. Dodsley's book,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1449tm" /> and, having pretty well looked it over, will (as you
					desire) tell you my opinion of it. He might, methinks, have spared the Graces<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1450tm" /> in his frontispiece, if
					he chose to be œconomical, and dressed his authors in a little more decent raiment &#x2013; not in whited-brown paper and distorted
					characters, like an old ballad. I am ashamed to see myself;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1451tm" /> but the company keeps me in countenance:
					so to begin with Mr. Tickell.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1452tm" /> This is not only a statepoem (my ancient aversion), but a state-poem on
					the peace of Utrecht.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1453tm" /> If Mr. Pope had wrote a panegyric on it, one could hardly have read him with
					patience: but this is only a poor short-winded imitator of Addison, who had himself not above three or four notes in poetry; sweet
					enough indeed, like those of a German flute, but such as soon tire and satiate the ear with their frequent return. Tickell has added to
					this a great poverty of sense, and a string of transitions that hardly become a schoolboy. However, I forgive him for the sake of his
						ballad,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1454tm" /> which I always thought the prettiest in the world. All there is of M. Green<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1455tm" /> here has been printed before: there is a profusion of wit every where; reading would have formed his
					judgment, and harmonized his verse, for even his wood-notes often break out into strains of real poetry and music. The
						Schoolmistress<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1456tm" /> is excellent in its kind, and masterly; and (I am sorry to differ from you, but)
						London<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1457tm" /> is to me one of those few imitations, that have all the ease and all the spirit of an
					original. The same man's verses at the opening of Garrick's theatre<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1458tm" /> are far from bad. Mr. Dyer<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1459tm" /> (here you will despise me highly) has more of poetry in his imagination, than almost any of our number; but
					rough and injudicious. </p>
				<p>I should range Mr. Bramston<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1460tm" /> only a step or two above Dr. King,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1461tm" />
					who is as low in my estimation as in yours. Dr. Evans<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1462tm" /> is a furious madman; and Pre-existence<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1463tm" /> is nonsense in all her altitudes. Mr. Lyttelton<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1464tm" /> is a gentle elegiac
					person: Mr. Nugent<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1465tm" /> sure did not write his own ode.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1466tm" /> I like Mr.
						Whitehead's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1467tm" /> little poems, I mean the Ode on a tent, the Verses to Garrick, and particularly those to
					Charles Townshend, better than any thing I had seen before of him. I gladly pass over H. Brown,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1468tm" /> and
					the rest, to come at you. You know I was of the publishing side, and thought your reasons against it none; for though, as Mr. Chute
					said extremely well, the <hi rend="italic">still small voice</hi> of Poetry was not made to be heard in a crowd; yet Satire will be
					heard, for all the audience are by nature her friends; especially when she appears in the spirit of Dryden, with his strength, and
					often with his versification; such as you have caught in those lines on the royal unction, on the papal dominion, and convents of both
					sexes, on Henry VIII. and Charles II. for these are to me the shining parts of your Epistle.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1469tm" /> There
					are many lines I could wish corrected, and some blotted out, but beauties enough to atone for a thousand worse faults than these. The
					opinion of such as can at all judge, who saw it before in Dr. Middleton's hands, concurs nearly with mine. As to what any one says,
					since it came out; our people (you must know) are slow of judgement; they wait till some bold body saves them the trouble, and then
					follow his opinion; or stay till they hear what is said in town, that is at some bishop's table, or some coffee-house about the Temple.
					When they are determined, I will tell you faithfully their verdict.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1470tm" /> As for the Beauties,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1471tm" /> I am their most humble servant. What shall I say to Mr. Lowth,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1472tm" /> Mr.
						Ridley,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1473tm" /> Mr. Rolle,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1474tm" /> the reverend Mr. Brown,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1475tm" /> Seward,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1476tm" /> &amp;c.? If I say, Messieurs! this is not the thing; write prose,
					write sermons, write nothing at all; they will disdain me, and my advice. What then would the sickly peer<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1477tm" /> have done, that spends so much time in admiring everything that has four legs, and fretting at his own
					misfortune in having but two; and cursing his own politic head and feeble constitution, that won't let him be such a beast as he would
					wish? Mr. S. Jenyns<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1478tm" /> now and then can write a good line or two &#x2013; such as these &#x2013;</p>
				<q>
					<p>Snatch us from all our little sorrows here, <lb /> Calm every grief, and dry each childish tear, &amp;c. </p>
				</q>
				<p>I like Mr. Aston Hervey's fable;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1479tm" /> and an ode<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1480tm" /> (the last of all) by
					Mr. Mason,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1481tm" /> a new acquaintance of mine, whose Musæus too seems to carry with it the promise at least
					of something good to come. I was glad to see you distinguished who poor West was, before his charming ode,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1482tm" /> and called it anything rather than a Pindaric. The town is an owl, if it don't like Lady Mary,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1483tm" /> and I am surprised at it: we here are owls enough to think her eclogues<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1484tm" />
					very bad; but that I did not wonder at. Our present taste is sir T. Fitz-Osborne's Letters.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1485tm" /> I send
					you a bit of a thing for two reasons: first, because it is one of your favourites, Mr. M. Green;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1486tm" /> and
					next, because I would do justice. The thought on which my second ode<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1487tm" /> turns is manifestly stole from
					hence: &#x2013; not that I knew it at the time, but, having<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1488tm" /> seen this many Years before, to be sure
					it imprinted itself on my Memory, &amp; forgetting the Author, I took it for my own. the Subject was the Queen's Hermitage.<anchor

					<p>Tho' yet no Palace grace the Shore <lb /> To lodge the Pair you<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1490tm" /> should adore;<lb /> Nor Abbies

						would chuse to go. <lb /> Wch sweet Abode, her wisest Choice, <lb /> Urania cheers with heavenly Voice: <lb /> While all the Virtues
						gather round <lb /> To see her consecrate the Ground. <lb /> If Thou, the God with winged Feet, <lb /> In Council talk of this

						Earth's Cells for Dwellings high: <lb /> And some, that did their six Wings keep, <lb /> Before they died, been forced to creep.
						<lb /> They Politicks, like ours, profess: <lb /> The greater prey upon the less. <lb /> Some strain on Foot huge Loads to bring,
						<lb /> Some toil incessant on the Wing: <lb /> Nor from their vigorous Schemes desist <lb /> Till Death; &amp; then are never mist.

				<p> Tho' I have been silent so long; do not imagine, I am at all less sensible to your Kindness, wch (to say the Truth) is of a
						Sort,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1500tm" /> that however obvious &amp; natural it may seem, has never once occur'd to any of my good
					Friends in Town, where I have been these seven Weeks. their Methods of Consolation were indeed very extraordinary: they were all so
					sorry for my Loss,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1501tm" /> that I could not chuse but laugh. one offer'd me Opera-Tickets, insisted upon
					carrying me to the Grand-Masquerade, desired me to sit for my Picture.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1502tm" /> others asked me to their
					Concerts, or Dinners &amp; Suppers at their Houses; or hoped, I would drink Chocolate with them, while I stayed in Town. all my
					Gratitude (or if you please, my Revenge) was to accept of every Thing they offer'd me: if it had been but a Shilling, I would have
					taken it. thank Heaven, I was in good Spirits; else I could not have done it. I profited all I was able of their Civilities, &amp; am
					returned into the Country loaded with their Bontés &amp; Politesses, but richer still in my own Reflexions, wch I owe in great Measure
					to them too. suffer a great Master<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1503tm" /> to tell them you for me in a better Manner</p>
				<q>
					<p>Aux sentimens de la Nature, <lb /> Aux plaisirs de la Verité, <lb /> Preferant le goût frelaté <lb /> Des plaisirs, qu'a fait

				<p>Your Friendship has interested itself in my Affairs so naturally, that I can not help troubleing you with a little Detail of them.
					the House I lost was insured for 500£, &amp; with the Deduction of 3 per Ct they paid me 485£, with wch I bought, when Stocks were
					lower, 525£. the Rebuilding will cost 590, &amp; other Expences, that necessarily attend it, will mount that Summ to 650.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1505tm" /> I have an Aunt<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1506tm" /> that gives me 100£; &amp; another,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1507tm" /> that I hope will lend me what I shall want: but if (contrary to my Expectation) I should be forced to have
					recourse to your Assistance: it can not be for above 50£; &amp; that, about Xmas next when the Thing is to be finish'd. and now, my
					dear Wharton, why must I tell you a Thing so contrary to my own Wishes, &amp; to yours, I believe? it is impossible for me to see you
					in the North, or to enjoy any of those agreeable Hours I had flatter'd myself with. I must be in Town several Times dureing the Summer;
					in August particularly, when half the Money is to be paid: the Relation,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1508tm" /> that used to do Things for
					me, is from Illness now quite incapable; &amp; the good People here would think me the most careless &amp; ruinous of Mortals, if I
					should think of such a Journey at this Time. the only Satisfaction I can pretend to, is that of hearing from you; &amp; particularly
					about this Time, I was bid to expect good News.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1509tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Your Opinion of Diodorus is doubtless right; but there are Things in him very curious, got out of better Authors now lost. do you
					remember the Egyptian History, &amp; particularly the Account of the Gold-Mines?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1510tm" /> my own Readings have
					been cruelly interrupted. what I have been highly pleased with is the new Comedy from Paris, by Gresset; Le Mechant,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1511tm" /> one of the very best Drama's I ever met with. if you have it not, buy his Works altogether in two little
						Volumes.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1512tm" /> they are collected by the Dutch Booksellers, &amp; consequently there is some Trash; but
					then there are the Ver-vert,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1513tm" /> the Epistle to P: Bougeant,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1514tm" /> the
						Chartreuse<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1515tm" /> that to his Sister,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1516tm" /> an Ode on his Country,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1517tm" /> &amp; another on Mediocrity;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1518tm" /> &amp; the Sidnei,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1519tm" /> another Comedy, wch have great Beauties. there is a Poem by Thomson,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1520tm" /> the
					Castle of Indolence, with some good Stanzas. Mr. Mason is my Acquaintance:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1521tm" /> I liked that Ode<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1522tm" /> very much, but have found no one else, that did. he has much Fancy, little Judgement, &amp; a good deal of
					Modesty. I take him for a good &amp; well-meaning Creature; but then he is really <hi rend="italic">in Simplicity a Child,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1523tm" /> &amp; loves every body he meets with: he reads little or nothing, writes abundance, &amp; that with
					a Design to make his Fortune by it. there is now, I think, no Hopes of the Pembroke Business<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1524tm" /> coming
					to any-thing. [My poor Tuthill]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1525tm" /> will be in a Manner destitute (even of a Curacy) at Midsummer.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1526tm" /> I need not bid you think of him, if any probable Means offer of doing him Good: I fear, he was not made to
					think much for himself. pray, let me hear from you soon. I am at Mrs Rogers's of Stoke near Windsor, Bucks. my thanks, &amp; best
					Compliments to Mrs Wharton, &amp; your Family. does that Name include any body, that I am not yet acquainted with?</p>

				<p>After having made my Compliments to the Godmothers of the little Doctress,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1528tm" /> who are to promise &amp;
					vow for her that she shall understand, &amp; be grateful some twelve or fifteen Years hence I congratulate Mrs Wharton &amp; your
					family on this Occasion, &amp; doubtless desire nothing more than to see you all the next Summer, tho' as to Promises, I dare not; lest
					some unlucky Event again come across, &amp; put the Performance out of my Power. I am not certain whether I shall be obliged to have
					recourse to your Assistance<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1529tm" /> or no about Christmas: but if I am, I will be sure to give you Notice in
					due Time.</p>
				<p>I am glad you have had any Pleasure in Gresset: he seems to me a truly elegant &amp; charming Writer. the Mechant is the best Comedy
					I ever read.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1530tm" /> Edward<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1531tm" /> I could scarce get thro': it is puerile; tho'
					there are good Lines; such as this, for Example <q>
						<p>Le jour d'un nouveau regne est le jour des ingrats.</p>
					</q> but good Lines will make any thing rather than a good Play. however you are to consider, this is a Collection made by the Dutch
					Booksellers. many Things unfinish'd or wrote in his Youth, or design'd not for the World, but to make a few Friends laugh, as the
					Lutrin vivant,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1532tm" /> &amp;c: there are two noble Verses, wch as they are in the middle of an <hi
						rend="italic">Ode to the King,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1533tm" /> may perhaps have escaped you. <q>
						<p>Le Cri d'un peuple heureux est la seule Eloquence, <lb /> Qui sçait parler des Rois.</p>
					</q> wch is very true, &amp; should have been a Hint to himself not to write Odes to the King at all. </p>
				<p>My Squabble with the Professor<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1534tm" /> I did not think worth mentioning to you. my Letter was by no means
					intended as a Composition, &amp; only design'd to be shew'd to some, who were Witnesses to the Impertinence, that gave Occasion for it:
					but he was Fool enough by Way of Revenge to make it mighty publick.</p>
				<p>I don't wonder your Mr Bolby<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1535tm" /> disapproves Mr [ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1536tm" /> Conduct at Rome:
					it was indeed very unlike his own. but when every body there of our Nation was base enough either to enter into an actual
					Correspondence with a certain most serene Person,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1537tm" /> or at least to talk carelessly &amp; doubtfully on
					what was then transacting at home, sure it was the Part of a Man of Spirit to declare his Sentiments publickly &amp; warmly. he was so
					far from making a Party, that he &amp; Mr ...<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1538tm" /> were the only Persons, that were of that Party. as to
					his Ends in it; from his first Return to England he has always frequented the Pr&#x2013;ces Court, &amp; been the open Friend of Mr. H:
						W:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1539tm" /> wch could certainly be no Way to recommend himself to the Ministry: unless you suppose his Views
					were very distant indeed.</p>
				<p>I should wish to know (when you can find Time for a Letter) what you think of my young Friend, St:r<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1540tm" />
					&amp; what Company he is fall'n into in the North. I fill up with the Beginning of a Sort of Essay.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1541tm" />
					what Name to give it I know not, but the Subject is, the Alliance of Education &amp; Government; I mean to shew that they must
					necessarily concur to produce great &amp; useful Men.</p>
				<q>
					<p>As sickly Plants betray a niggard Earth, <lb /> Whose flinty Bosom starves her generous Birth, <lb /> Nor genial Warmth, nor genial
						Juice retains <lb /> Their Roots to feed, &amp; fill their verdant Veins. <lb /> And as in Climes, where Winter holds his Reign,
						<lb /> The Soil, tho' fertile, will not teem in vain, <lb /> Forbids her Gems to swell, her Shades to rise, <lb /> Nor trusts her
						Blossoms to the churlish Skies. <lb /> So draw Mankind in vain the vital Airs, <lb /> Unform'd, unfriended, by those kindly Cares,
						<lb /> That Health &amp; Vigour to the Soul impart, <lb /> Spread the young Thought, &amp; warm the opening Heart. <lb /> So fond
						Instruction on the growing Powers <lb /> Of Nature idly lavishes her Stores: <lb /> If equal Justice with unclouded Face <lb /> Smile
						not indulgent on the rising Race, <lb /> And scatter with a free, tho' frugal, Hand <lb /> Light golden Showers of Plenty o'er the
						Land. <lb /> But gloomy Sway have fix'd her Empire there <lb /> To check their tender Hopes with chilling Fear, <lb /> And blast the
						vernal Promise of the Year. <lb />This spacious animated Scene survey <lb /> From where the rowling Orb, that gives the Day, <lb /> His
						sable Sons with nearer Course surrounds <lb /> To either Pole, and Life's remotest Bounds: <lb /> How rude soe'er th'exteriour Form we
						find, <lb /> Howe'er Opinion tinge the varied Mind; <lb /> Alike to all the Kind impartial Heav'n <lb /> The Sparks of Truth &amp;
						Happiness has given. <lb /> With Sense to feel, with Mem'ry to retain, <lb /> They follow Pleasure, &amp; they fly from Pain. <lb />
						Their Judgement mends the Plan their Fancy draws, <lb /> Th' Event presages, &amp; explores the Cause. <lb /> The soft Returns of
						Gratitude they know, <lb /> By Fraud elude, by Force repell the Foe, <lb /> While mutual Wishes, mutual Woes endear <lb /> The social
						Smile &amp; sympathetic Tear. <lb /> Say then, thro' Ages by what Fate confined <lb /> To different Climes seem diff'rent Souls
						assign'd? <lb /> Here measured Laws &amp; philosophic Ease <lb /> Fix &amp; improve the polish'd Arts of Peace: <lb /> There Industry
						&amp; Gain their Vigils keep, <lb /> Command the Winds, &amp; tame th'unwilling Deep, <lb /> Here Force &amp; hardy Deeds of Blood
						prevail: <lb /> There languid Pleasure sighs in every Gale. <lb /> Oft o'er the trembling Nations from afar <lb /> Has Scythia
						breath'd the living Cloud of War: <lb /> And where the Deluge burst, with sweepy Sway <lb /> Their Arms, their Kings, their gods were
						roll'd away, <lb /> As oft have issued, Host impelling Host, <lb /> The blue-eyed Myriads<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1542tm" /> from the
						Baltic Coast,<lb /> The prostrate South to the Destroyer yields <lb /> Her boasted Titles &amp; her golden Fields; <lb /> With grim
						Delight the Brood of Winter view <lb /> A brighter Day &amp; Skies of azure Hue <lb /> Catch the new Fragrance of the breathing Rose,
						<lb /> And quaff the pendent Vintage, as it grows. </p>

				<p>I was yesterday told, that Turner (the Professor of Modern History here) was dead in London.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1550tm" /> if it
					be true; I conclude, it is now too late to begin asking for it: but we had (if you remember) some Conversation on that Head at
					Twickenham; &amp; as you have probably found some Opportunity to mention it to Mr W: since, I would gladly know his Thoughts about it.
					what he can do, he only can tell us: what he will do, if he can, is with me no Question. if he could find a proper Channel; I certainly
					might ask it with as much, or more Propriety, than any one in this Place. if any thing were done, it should be as private as possible;
					for if the People, who have any Sway here, could prevent it, I think they would most zealously. I am not sorry for writing you a little
					interested Letter: perhaps it is a Stratagem: the only one I had left, to provoke an Answer from you, &amp; revive our &#x2013;
					Correspondence, shall I call it? there are many particulars relating to you, that have long interested me more than twenty Matters of
					this Sort, but you have had no Regard for my Curiosity: and yet it is something, that deserves a better Name! I don't so much as know
					your Direction, or that of Mr Whithed.</p>

				<p>Shall I be expeditious enough to bring you the News of the Peace, before you meet with it in the Papers? not the Peace of Aix la
						Chapelle,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1552tm" /> Mother of Proclamations &amp; of Fireworks, that lowers the Price of Oranges &amp;
						Malaga-Sack,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1553tm" /> &amp; enhaunces that of Poor-Jack<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1554tm" /> and barrel'd
						Cod:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1555tm" /> no, nor the Peace between Adil-Shah &amp; the Great Mogol;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1556tm" />
					but the Peace of Pembroke<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1557tm" /> sign'd between the high &amp; mighty Prince Roger, surnamed the Long, Lord
					of the great Zodiack, the Glass Uranium, &amp; the Chariot that goes without Horses,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1558tm" /> on the one Part;
					&amp; the most noble James Brown,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1559tm" /> the most serene Theophilus Peele,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1560tm" />
					and the most profound Nehemiah May,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1561tm" /> &amp;c: on the other.</p>
				<p>In short without farther Preliminaries Knowles,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1562tm" /> Mason,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1563tm" /> &amp;
						Tuthill<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1564tm" /> are elected, and the last of them is actually here on the Spot, as you will shortly hear
					from himself. the Negotiations, that preceded this wonderful Event, are inexplicable. the Success of the Affair was extremely uncertain
					but the very Night before it, &amp; had come to nothing, if Browne fixed &amp; obstinate as a little Rock had not resisted the
					Sollicitations of Smith,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1565tm" /> &amp; Smart,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1566tm" /> almost quarrel'd with Peele
					and May, &amp; given up, as in a Huff, the Liveing of Tylney,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1567tm" /> to wch he had that Morning been
					presented. I say, this seem'd to them to be done in a Huff, but was in reality a Thing he had determined to do, be the Event of the
					Election what it would. they were desirous of electing two, as the Master proposed, Knowles &amp; Mason, or Mason &amp;
						Gaskarth,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1568tm" /> for they were sure he would never admit Tuthill, as he had so often declared it. however,
					I say, Brown continued stedfast, that all three should come in, or none at all; &amp; when they met next day, he begun by resigning
					Tylney, &amp; then desired the Master would either put an End to their long Disputes himself, as they intreated him; or else they would
					refer the whole to a Visitor, &amp; did conjure him to call one in, as soon as possible. the rest did not contradict him, tho' the
					Proposal was much against their real Inclinations. so Roger believing them unanimous (after some few Pribbles &amp; Prabbles)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1569tm" /> said, well then, if it be for ye Good of ye College &#x2013; but you intend Knowles shall be Senior?
					&#x2013; To be sure, Master &#x2013; Well then &#x2013; &amp; so they proceeded to Election &amp; all was over in a few Minutes. I do
					believe, that Roger despairing now of a Visitor to his Mind, &amp; advised by all his Acquaintance (among whom I reckon Keene,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1570tm" /> whose Acquaintance I have cultivated with the same Views you mention'd in your Letter to Brown) to finish
					the Matter, had been for some Months determined to do so, but not till he made a last Effort. he made it indeed, but not having
					Sagacity enough to find out, how near carrying his Point he was; being ignorant of the Weakness of a Part of his College, &amp; they
					not cunning, or perhaps not dishonest enough, to discover it to him, he thought he had miss'd his Aim, &amp; so gave it up without
					farther Struggling. I hope you will be glad to see so good an End of an Affair you give Birth to: Brown is quite happy, &amp; we vastly
					glad to be obliged to the only Man left among them, that one would care to be obliged to. there are two more Fellowships remain to be
					filled up at the Commencement. by the Way Tuthill has been just holding a Candle &#x2013; not to the Devil, but to the Master, as he
					was reading some Papers in Hall; and the Boys peep'd in at the Screens to see it, &amp; to laugh. </p>
				<p>Keene is most sadly <hi rend="italic">implicated</hi> in the beginning of his Reign about an Election,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1571tm"
					 /> &amp; I am of his Cabinet-Council, hitherto for the Reasons you<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1572tm" /> wot of, &amp; now because I can't
					help it. but I am rather tired of College-Details (as I doubt not, you are) &amp; so I leave this Story to be recorded by the Annalists
					of Peterhouse; &amp; let Historians of equal Dignity tell of the Triumphs of Chappy,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1573tm" /> the
						Installations,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1574tm" /> the Visitations, &amp; other memorable Events, that distinguish &amp; adorn his
					glorious Reign.</p>
				<p>You ask for some Account of Books. the principal I can tell you of is a Work of the Presid:t Montesquieu's,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1575tm" /> the Labour of 20 Years. it is call'd, L'Esprit des Loix, 2 V: 4to, printed at Geneva.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1576tm" /> he lays down the Principles on wch are founded the three Sorts of Government, Despotism, the limited
					Monarchic, &amp; the Republican, &amp; shews how from thence are deduced the Laws &amp; Customs, by wch they are guided &amp;
					maintained; the Education proper to each Form, the influences of Climate, Situation, Religion, &amp;c: on the Minds of particular
					Nations, &amp; on their Policy. the Subject (you see) is as extensive as Mankind; the Thoughts perfectly new,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1577tm" /> generally admirable, as they are just, sometimes a little too refined: in short there are Faults, but such
					as an ordinary Man could never have committed: the Style very lively &amp; concise (consequently sometimes obscure) it is the Gravity
					of Tacitus (whom he admires) temper'd with the Gayety &amp; Fire of a Frenchman.</p>

				<p>I perceive, that Second Parts are as bad to write, as they can be to read; for this, wch you ought to have had a Week after the
					first, has been a full Month in coming forth. the Spirit of Lazyness (the Spirit of the Place),<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1581tm" />
					begins to possess even me, that have so long declaimed against it: yet has it not so prevail'd, but that I feel that Discontent with
					myself, that <hi rend="italic">Ennuy,</hi> that ever accompanies it in its Beginnings. Time will settle my Conscience, Time will
					reconcile me to this languid Companion: we shall smoke, we shall tipple, we shall doze together. we shall have our little Jokes, like
					other People, and our long Stories; Brandy will finish what Port begun; &amp; a Month after the Time you will see in some Corner of a
					London Even:ng Post, Yesterday, died the Revnd Mr John Grey, Senior-Fellow of Clare-Hall, a facetious Companion, &amp; well-respected
					by all that knew him.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1582tm" /> his death is supposed to have been occasion'd by a Fit of an Apoplexy, being
					found fall'n out of Bed with his Head in the Chamber-Pot.</p>
				<p>I am half ashamed to write University News to you, but as perhaps you retain some little Leven of Pembroke Hall, your nursing Mother,
					I am in hopes you will not be more than half-ashamed to read it. Pembroke then is all harmonious &amp; delightful since the
						Pacification:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1583tm" /> but I wish you would send them up some Boys, for they are grown extremely thin<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1584tm" /> from their late long Indisposition. Keene's <hi rend="italic">Implications</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1585tm" /> have ended queerly, for contrary to all Common-Sense Peter Nourse<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1586tm" />
					&amp; two others have joined Rogers,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1587tm" /> &amp; brought in a shameful low Creature by a Majority. the
					Master appeals to the Visitor against their Choice, as of a Person not qualified. he has received the Appeal, &amp; (I suppose) will
					put in Brocket<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1588tm" /> (Dr Keene's Man) by main Force. Chapman<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1589tm" /> is at
					present in Town in waiting; he has just married a Miss Barnwell, Niece to one Dr Barnwell,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1590tm" /> who was
					Minister of Trompington, with 2000£, a plain Woman, &amp; about his own Age. I hear, that when he sent to Leicester-House<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1591tm" /> to know, when the Prince would be waited upon with the Book of Verses on the Peace<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1592tm" /> the Prince appointed no Day at all; but order'd the Verses to be sent, &amp; left there. the Design of
					receiving the University at New-Castle House<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1593tm" /> is said to be alter'd; the Duke intending to come
					hither, (I imagine) after the Parliament is risen. Rosse's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1594tm" /> Epistles of Tully ad Familiares will come
					out in about a Week. it is in two handsome 8vo Volumes with an Introd:tion &amp; Notes in English,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1595tm" />
					but no Translation, dedicated to Ld Gower.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1596tm" /> now I am come to Books, there is a new Edition of
					Montesquieu's Work (wch I mention'd to you before) publishing in 2V 8vo.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1597tm" />
				</p>
				<p>have you seen old Crebillon's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1598tm" /> Catilina, a Tragedy, wch has had a prodigious Run at Paris?
					historical Truth is too much perverted in it, wch is ridiculous in a Story so generally known: but if you can get over this, the
					Sentiments &amp; Versification are fine, &amp; most of the Characters (particularly the principal one) painted with great Spirit.
					observe, if you chuse to send for it, not to have Brindley's Edition, wch is all false Prints, but Vaillant's.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1599tm" /> there is a Work publishing in Denmark by Subscription (4 Guineas) Travels in Egypt by Capt: Norden.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1600tm" /> he was once in England (as Tutor to a young Count Daniskiold, hereditary Admiral of Denmark) &amp; known to
					many Persons for a Man of Sense, &amp; that understood Drawing extremely well: accordingly it is the Plates, that raise it to such a
					price, &amp; are said to be excellent. the Author himself is dead, &amp; his papers are publish'd by the Academy at Copenhagen. Mr
						Birch,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1601tm" /> the indefatigable, has just put out a thick 8vo of original Papers of Q: Elizabeth's Time.
					there are many curious Things in it, particularly Letters from Sr Rob: Cecil (Salisbury)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1602tm" /> about his
					Negotiations with Henry the 4th of France; the Earl of Monmouth's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1603tm" /> odd Account of Q: Elizabeth's
					Death, several Peculiarities of James 1st &amp; Pr: Henry, &amp;c: and above all an excellent Account of the State of France with
					Characters of the King, his Court, &amp; Ministry, by Sr G: Carew,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1604tm" /> Ambassador there. this, I think,
					is all new worth mentioning, that I have seen or heard of, except a natural History of Peru in Spanish, printed at London,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1605tm" /> by Don &#x2014; something, a Man of Learning, sent thither by the Court on Purpose.</p>
				<p>I shall venture to accept of a Part of that kind Offer you once made me<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1606tm" /> (for my Finances are much
					disorder'd this Year) by desiring you to lend me twenty Guineas. the sooner you can do this, the more convenient it will be to me,
					&amp; if you can find a Method to pay it here; still more so. but if any thing should happen, that may defer it, or make this Method
					troublesome: then I will desire you to make it payable in Town after the first Week in June, when I shall be obliged to go thither.</p>
				<p>I want to hear from you, to know of your Health &amp; that of your Family. my best Compliments to Mrs Wharton, Mr Brown comes &amp;
					throws in his <hi rend="italic">little comps</hi> too, &amp; we are both very truly</p>

				<p>I promised Dr Keene<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1609tm" /> long since to give you an Account of our Magnificences here,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1610tm" /> but the News-Papers &amp; he himself in Person have got the Start of my Indolence, so that by this Time you
					are well acquainted with all the Events, that adorned that Week of Wonders. thus much I may venture to tell you, because it is probable
					no body else has done it, that our Friend Chappy's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1611tm" /> Zeal &amp; Eloquence surpassed all Power of
					Description. Vesuvio in an Eruption was not more violent than his Utterance, nor (since I am at my Mountains) Pelion with all its
					Pine-trees in a Storm of Wind more impetuous than his Action. and yet the Senate-house still stands, &amp; (I thank God) we are all
					safe and well at your Service. I was ready to sink for him, &amp; scarce dared to look about me, when I was sure it was all over: but
					soon found I might have spared my Confusion, for all People join'd to applaud him: every thing was quite right; &amp; I dare swear, not
					three People here but think him a Model of Oratory. for all the Duke's little Court came with a Resolution to be pleased; &amp; when
					the Tone was once given the University, who ever wait for the Judgement of their Betters, struck into it with an admirable Harmony. for
					the rest of the Performances they were (as usual) very ordinary. every one, while it lasted, was very gay, &amp; very busy in the
					Morning, &amp; very owlish &amp; very tipsy at Night. I make no Exceptions from the Chancellour to Blew-Coat.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1612tm" /> Mason's Ode<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1613tm" /> was the only Entertainment, that had any tolerable Elegance;
					&amp; for my own Part I think it (with some little abatements) uncommonly well on such an Occasion. pray let me know your Sentiments,
					for doubtless you have seen it. the Author of it grows apace into my good Graces, as I know him more: he is very ingenious with great
					Good-Nature &amp; Simplicity. a little vain, but in so harmless &amp; so comical a Way, that it does not offend one at all; a little
					ambitious, but withall so ignorant in the World &amp; its Ways, that this does not hurt him in one's Opinion. so sincere &amp; so
					undisguised, that no Mind with a Spark of Generosity would ever think of hurting him, he lies so open to Injury. but so indolent, that
					if he can not overcome this Habit, all his good Qualities will signify nothing at all. after all I like him so well, I could wish you
					knew him.</p>
				<p>[Tuthill],<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1614tm" /> who was here at the Installation &amp; in high Spirits, will come to settle in Cambridge
					at Michaelmas. and I have hopes, that these two with Brown's assistance may bring Pembroke into some Esteem: but then there is no
					making Bricks without Straw. they have no Boys at all,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1615tm" /> &amp; unless you can send us a Hamper or two
					out of the North to begin with, they will be like a few Rats straggling about an old deserted Mansion-House.</p>
				<p>I should be glad (as you will see Keene often<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1616tm" /> ) if you could throw in a Word, as of your own head
					merely, about a Fellowship for Stonhewer. he has several times mention'd it himself, as a Thing he would try to bring about either at
					Queen's or Christ's, where he has interest: but I know not how, it has gone off again, &amp; we have heard no more lately about it. I
					know it is not practicable here at Peter-house, because of his County;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1617tm" /> &amp; tho' at Pembroke we
					might possibly get a Majority, yet Roger<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1618tm" /> is an animal, that might play over again all his old Game,
					&amp; with a better appearance than before. you would therefore oblige me, if you would sound him upon this subject, for it is
					Stonhewer's Wish, &amp; (I think) would be an Advantage to him, if he had a Reason for continuing here some time longer. if you can get
					Keene to be explicit about it (but it must seem to be a Thought entirely of your own) I will desire you to let me know the Result. my
					best Wishes, Dear Sr, ever attend on you, &amp; Mrs Wharton. I am most sincerely &amp; unalterably</p>

				<p>The unhappy news I have just received from you equally surprises and afflicts me.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1621tm" /> I have lost a
					person I loved very much, and have been used to from my infancy; but am much more concerned for your loss, the circumstances of which I
					forbear to dwell upon, as you must be too sensible of them yourself; and will, I fear, more and more need a consolation that no one can
					give, except He who has preserved her to you so many years, and at last, when it was his pleasure, has taken her from us to himself:
					and perhaps, if we reflect upon what she felt in this life, we may look upon this as an instance of his goodness both to her, and to
					those that loved her. She might have languished many years before our eyes in a continual increase of pain, and totally helpless; she
					might have long wished to end her misery without being able to attain it; or perhaps even lost all sense, and yet continued to breathe;
					a sad spectacle to such as must have felt more for her than she could have done for herself. However you may deplore your own loss, yet
					think that she is at last easy and happy; and has now more occasion to pity us than we her. I hope, and beg, you will support yourself
					with that resignation we owe to him, who gave us our being for our good, and who deprives us of it for the same reason. I would have
					come to you directly, but you do not say whether you desire I should or not; if you do, I beg I may know it, for there is nothing to
					hinder me, and I am in very good health. </p>

				<p> As I live in a place, where even the ordinary tattle of the town arrives not till it is stale, and which produces no events of its
					own, you will not desire any excuse from me for writing so seldom, especially as of all people living I know you are the least a friend
					to letters spun out of one's own brains, with all the toil and constraint that accompanies sentimental productions. I have been here at
					Stoke a few days (where I shall continue good part of the summer); and having put an end to a thing,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1628tm" />
					whose beginning you have seen long ago,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1629tm" /> I immediately send it you.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1630tm" />
					You will, I hope, look upon it in the light of a <hi rend="italic">thing with an end to it</hi>; a merit that most of my writings have
					wanted, and are like to want, but which this epistle I am determined shall not want, when it tells you that I am ever</p>

				<postscript>
					<p>Not that I have done yet; but who could avoid the temptation of finishing so roundly and so cleverly in the manner of good queen
						Anne's days? Now I have talked of writings; I have seen a book, which is by this time in the press, against Middleton (though without
						naming him), by Asheton.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1631tm" /> As far as I can judge from a very hasty reading, there are things in it new

					</q> but Aristotle may say whatever he pleases. I do not find myself at all the worse for it. I could indeed wish to refresh my <hi
						rend="italic">Ενέργεια</hi> a little at Durham by a Sight of you, but when is there a Probability of my being so happy? it concerned
					me greatly when I heard the other Day, that your Asthma continued at Times to afflict you, &amp; that you were often obliged to go into
					the Country to breath. you cannot oblige me more than by giving me an Account of the State both of your Body &amp; Mind; I hope the
					latter is able to keep you chearful &amp; easy in spite of the Frailties of its Companion. as to my own it can do neither one, nor the
					other; &amp; I have the Mortification to find my spiritual Part the most infirm Thing about me. You have doubtless heard of the Loss I
					have had in Dr. Middleton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1634tm" /> whose House was the only easy Place one could find to converse in at
					Cambridge. for my Part I find a Friend so uncommon a Thing, that I can not help regretting even an old Acquaintance, wch is an
					indifferent Likeness of it, &amp; tho' I don't approve the Spirit of his Books, methinks 'tis pity the World should lose so rare a
					Thing as a good Writer.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1635tm" /> my Studies can not furnish a Recommendation of many new Books to you. there
					is a Defense de l'Esprit des Loix<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1636tm" /> by Montesquieu himself. it has some lively Things in it, but is
					very short, &amp; his Adversary<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1637tm" /> appears to be so mean a Bigot, that he deserved no Answer. there are
					3 V: in 4to of, Histoire du Cabinet du Roi,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1638tm" /> by Mess: Buffons,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1639tm" /> &amp;
						D'Aubenton.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1640tm" /> the first is a Man of Character, but (I am told) has hurt it by this Work. it is all a
					Sort of Introduction to Natural History. the weak Part of it is a Love of System,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1641tm" /> wch runs thro' it,
					the most contrary Thing in the World to a Science, entirely grounded upon Experiments, &amp; that has nothing to do with Vivacity of
					Imagination. there are some microscopical Observations, that seem'd curious to me, on those Animalcula to wch we are supposed to owe
					our Origin; &amp; wch he has discover'd of like Figure in Females not pregnant, &amp; in almost every Thing we use for Nourishment,
					even Vegetables, particularly in their Fruits &amp; Seeds. not that he allows them to be animated Bodies, but <hi rend="italic"
						>Molecules organisées.</hi> if you ask what that is, I can not tell; no more than I can understand a new System of Generation wch he
					builds upon it. but what I was going to commend is a general View he gives of the Face of the Earth, follow'd by a particular one of
					all known Nations, their peculiar Figure &amp; Manners, wch is the best Epitome of Geography I ever met with, &amp; wrote with Sense,
					&amp; Elegance: in short these Books are well worth turning over. the Memoires of the Abbé de Mongon<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1642tm" />
					in 5 V: are highly commended, but I have not seen them. he was engaged in several Embassies to Germany, England, &amp;c: during the
					Course of the late War. The Presid: Henault's Abregé Chronol:ique de l'Hist: de France<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1643tm" /> I believe I

				<p>You advised me in your last to be acquainted with [Keene]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1644tm" /> &amp; we are accordingly on very good

				<p>You are apprised by this time (I don't doubt) that your Mr Spencer<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1658tm" /> is chose at Pembroke. I
					received, while I was at Stoke, a Letter from [Tuthill],<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1659tm" /> wherein were these Words 'Spencer will, I am
					almost persuaded, be chose at this Audit, &amp; perhaps without a Quarrel. I shall vote for him with great Pleasure, because I believe
					he may justly claim it, &amp; because I believe Dr Wharton would, if he knew of our Election, desire it, for <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
					was maintain'd by his Mr Wilkinson.'<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1660tm" /> Dr Long did not make any Resistance, when he saw how it would
					go, so Chapman<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1661tm" /> had little Occasion for his <hi rend="italic">effectual Interest.</hi> oh, by the Way
					I give you joy of that agreeable Creature, who has got one of your Prebends of 400£ a Year,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1662tm" /> &amp;
					will visit you soon, with that dry Piece of Goods, his Wife.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1663tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Of my House<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1664tm" /> I can not say much: I wish I could! but for my Heart it is no less yours than it has
					long been; &amp; the last Thing in the World, that will throw it into Tumults, is a fine Lady.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1665tm" /> the
						Verses<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1666tm" /> you so kindly try to keep in countenance were wrote to divert that particular Family, &amp;
					succeeded accordingly. but, being shew'd about in Town, are not liked there at all. Mrs French,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1667tm" /> a
					very fashionable Personage, told Mr W: that she had seen a Thing by a Friend of his, wch she did not know what to make of, for it aim'd
					at every Thing, &amp; meant nothing. to wch he replied, that he had always taken her for a Woman of Sense, &amp; was very sorry to be
					undeceived. On the other hand the Stanza's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1668tm" /> wch I now enclose to you, have had the Misfortune by Mr
					W:s Fault<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1669tm" /> to be made still more publick, for wch they certainly were never meant, but it is too late
					to complain. they have been so applauded, it is quite a Shame to repeat it. I mean not to be modest; but I mean, it is a Shame for
					those, who have said such superlative Things about them, that I can't repeat them. I should have been glad, that you &amp; two or three
					more People had liked them, wch would have satisfied my ambition on this Head amply. I have been this Month in town, not at
					Newcastle-House, but diverting myself among my gay Acquaintance; &amp; return to my Cell with so much the more Pleasure. I dare not
					speak of my future Excursion to Durham for fear &#x2013; but at present it is my full Intention.</p>

					Science, Commerce, &amp;c: of his Subjects, &amp; on their Changes in Religion. it is much in Voltaire's Manner.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1673tm" /> the Book itself is at present hard to be got, but you may see a good Extract of it in the Mercure
						historique,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1674tm" /> a Work publish'd monthly: whether it is that for Oct: or Sept:r I can not justly say.
					there is also an Account of the History of Crusades, wch seem's to be Voltaire's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1675tm" /> &amp; promises
					well. I hear talk of a Pamphlet, call'd, Voix du Sage &amp; du Peuple,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1676tm" /> ascribed to Montesquieu; &amp;
					a Book, styled only <hi rend="italic">Lettres,</hi> by the Procureur General, Fleury,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1677tm" /> on the Power of
					the Clergy in France, but have not seen either of them, being very scarce as yet. Mr de Buffon<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1678tm" /> has

						<p>ELEGY, WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY-CHURCHYARD </p>
						<p>The Curfeu tolls the Knell of parting Day, <lb /> The lowing Herd wind slowly o'er the Lea, <lb /> The Ploughman homeward plods his
							weary Way, <lb /> And leaves the World to Darkness &amp; to me. <lb /> Now fades the glimm'ring Landscape on the Sight, <lb /> And
							all the Air a solemn Stillness holds: <lb /> Save where the Beetle wheels his droning Flight, <lb /> Or drowsy Tinkleings lull the
							distant Folds: <lb /> Save that from yonder ivy-mantled Tower <lb /> The mopeing Owl does to the Moon complain <lb /> Of such, as
							wand'ring near her secret Bower <lb /> Molest her ancient solitary Reign. <lb /> Beneath those rugged Elms, that Yewtree's Shade,
							<lb /> Where heaves the Turf in many a mould'ring Heap, <lb /> Each in his narrow Cell for ever laid, <lb /> The rude Forefathers of
							the Hamlet sleep. <lb /> The breezy Call of incense-breathing Morn, <lb /> The Swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built Shed, <lb />
							The Cock's shrill Clarion, &amp; the ecchoing Horn, <lb /> No more shall rowse them from their lowly Bed. <lb /> For them no more the
							blazing Hearth shall burn, <lb /> Or busy Huswife ply her Evening Care. <lb /> No Children run to lisp their Sire's Return, <lb />
							Nor climb his Knees the envied Kiss to share. <lb /> Oft did the Harvest to their Sickles yield, <lb /> Their Furrow oft the stubborn
							Glebe has broke, <lb /> How jocund did they drive their Team a-field! <lb /> How bow'd the Woods beneath their sturdy Stroke! <lb />
							Let not Ambition mock their useful Toil, <lb /> Their homely Joys, &amp; Destiny obscure; <lb /> Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful
							Smile <lb /> The short &amp; simple Annals of the Poor. <lb /> The Boast of Heraldry, the Pomp of Power, <lb /> And all that Beauty,
							all that Wealth e'er gave, <lb /> Awaits alike th' inevitable Hour. <lb /> The Paths of Glory lead but to the Grave. <lb /> Forgive,
							ye Proud, th' involuntary Fault, <lb /> If Memory to These no Trophies raise, <lb /> Where thro' the long-drawn Ile &amp; fretted
							Vault <lb /> The pealing Anthem swells the Note of Praise. <lb /> Can storied Urn or animated Bust <lb /> Back to its Mansion call
							the fleeting Breath? <lb /> Can Honour's Voice provoke the silent Dust, <lb /> Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold Ear of Death? <lb />
							Perhaps in this neglected Spot is laid <lb /> Some Heart, once pregnant with celestial Fire, <lb /> Hands, that the Reins of Empire
							might have sway'd, <lb /> Or waked to Extasy the living Lyre; <lb /> But Knowledge to their Eyes her ample Page <lb /> Rich with the
							Spoils of Time did ne'er unroll: <lb /> Chill Penury repress'd their noble Rage, <lb /> And froze the genial Current of the Soul.
							<lb /> Full many a Gem of purest Ray serene <lb /> The dark unfathom'd Caves of Ocean bear: <lb /> Full many a Flower is born to
							blush unseen, <lb /> And wast it's Sweetness on the desert Air. <lb /> Some Village-Hambden, that with dauntless Breast <lb /> The
							little Tyrant of his Fields withstood, <lb /> Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, <lb /> Some Cromwell, guiltless of his
							Country's Blood. <lb /> Th' Applause of list'ning Senates to command, <lb /> The Threats of Pain &amp; Ruin to despise, <lb /> To
							scatter Plenty o'er a smiling Land, <lb /> And read their Hist'ry in a Nation's Eyes, <lb /> Their Lot forbad: nor circumscribed
							alone <lb /> Their growing Virtues, but their Crimes confined; <lb /> Forbad to wade thro' Slaughter to a Throne, <lb /> Or shut the
							Gates of Mercy on Mankind, <lb /> The struggling Pangs of conscious Truth to hide, <lb /> To quench the Blushes of ingenuous Shame,
							<lb /> Or heap the Shrines of Luxury &amp; Pride <lb /> With Incense, kindled at the Muse's Flame. <lb /> Far from the madding
							Crowd's ignoble Strife, <lb /> Their sober Wishes never learn'd to stray: <lb /> Along the cool sequester'd Vale of Life <lb /> They
							kept the noiseless Tenour of their Way. <lb /> Yet ev'n these Bones from Insult to protect <lb /> Some frail Memorial still erected
							nigh, <lb /> With uncouth Rhymes &amp; shapeless Sculpture deck'd, <lb /> Implores the passing Tribute of a Sigh. <lb /> Their Name,
							their years, spell'd by th' unletter'd Muse, <lb /> The Place of Fame &amp; Elegy supply; <lb /> And many a holy Text around She
							strews <lb /> That teach the rustic Moralist to die. <lb /> For who to dumb Forgetfulness a Prey <lb /> This pleasing anxious Being
							e'er resign'd, <lb /> Left the warm Precincts of the chearful Day, <lb /> Nor cast one longing lingering Look behind? <lb /> On some
							fond Breast the parting Soul relies, <lb /> Some pious Drops the closing Eye requires: <lb /> Ev'n from the Tomb the Voice of Nature
							cries, <lb /> And in our Ashes glow their wonted Fires. <lb /> For Thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead <lb /> Dost in these
							Lines their artless Tale relate, <lb /> If chance by lonely Contemplation led <lb /> Some kindred Spirit shall enquire thy Fate;
							<lb /> Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say, <lb /> 'Oft have we seen him at the Peep of Dawn <lb /> 'Brushing with hasty Steps the
							Dews away <lb /> 'To meet the Sun upon the upland Lawn. <lb /> 'There, at the Foot of yonder nodding Beech, <lb /> 'That wreathes its
							old fantastic Roots so high <lb /> 'His listless Length at Noontide would he stretch <lb /> 'And pore upon the Brook, that babbles
							by. <lb /> 'Hard by yon Wood, now smiling as in Scorn <lb /> 'Mutt'ring his wayward Fancies would he rove <lb /> 'Now drooping
							woeful-wan, like one forlorn, <lb /> 'Or crazed with Care, or cross'd in hopeless Love. <lb /> 'One Morn I miss'd him on the custom'd
							Hill, <lb /> 'Along the Heath, &amp; near his fav'rite Tree: <lb /> 'Another came, nor yet beside the Rill, <lb /> 'Nor up the Lawn,

							Recompence as largely send: <lb /> He gave to Misery all he had, a Tear; <lb /> He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a Friend.
							<lb /> No farther seek his Merits to disclose, <lb /> Or draw his Frailties from their dread Abode, <lb /> (There they alike in

				<p>As you have brought me into a little Sort of Distress, you must assist me, I believe, to get out of it, as well as I can. yesterday I

						>Magazine of Magazines</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1687tm" /> into their Hands. they tell me, that an <hi rend="italic">ingenious</hi> Poem, call'd, <hi
						rend="italic">Reflections</hi> in a Country-Churchyard, has been communicated to them, wch they are printing forthwith: that they are
					inform'd, that the <hi rend="italic">excellent</hi> Author of it is I by name, &amp; that they beg not only his <hi rend="italic"
						>Indulgence,</hi> but the <hi rend="italic">Honor of his Correspondence,</hi> &amp;c: as I am not at all disposed to be either so
					indulgent, or so correspondent, as they desire; I have but one bad Way left to escape the Honour they would inflict upon me. &amp;
					therefore am obliged to desire you would make Dodsley print it immediately (wch may be done in less than a Week's time)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1688tm" /> from your Copy, but without my Name, in what Form is most convenient for him, but in his best Paper &amp;
					Character. he must correct the Press himself, &amp; print it without any Interval between the Stanza's, because the Sense is in some
					Places continued beyond them; &amp; the Title must be, Elegy, wrote in a Country Church-yard. if he would add a Line or two to say it
					came into his Hands by Accident,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1689tm" /> I should like it better. if you think fit, the 102d Line may be read <q>
						<p>Awake, &amp; faithful to her wonted Fires.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1690tm" /></p>

				<p> You have indeed conducted with great decency my little <hi rend="italic">misfortune</hi>: you have taken a paternal care of it, and
					expressed much more kindness than could have been expected from so near a relation. But we are all frail; and I hope to do as much for

					lives. But no matter: we have ourselves suffered under her hands before now;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1693tm" /> and besides, it will
					only look the more careless, and by <hi rend="italic">accident</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1694tm" /> as it were. I thank you for your advertisement, which saves my honour, and in a manner <hi

					intend to send you the beginning of a drama,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1696tm" /> not mine, thank God, as you'll believe, when you hear it
					is finished, but wrote by a person whom I have a very good opinion of. It is (unfortunately) in the manner of the ancient drama, with
					choruses, which I am, to my shame, the occasion of; for, as great part of it was at first written in that form, I would not suffer him
					to change it to a play fit for the stage, as he intended, because the lyric parts are the best of it, and they must have been lost. The
					story is Saxon, and the language has a tang of Shakespeare, that suits an old-fashioned fable very well. In short, I don't do it merely
					to amuse you, but for the sake of the author, who wants a judge, and so I would lend him <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>: yet not without
					your leave, lest you should have us up to dirty our stockings at the bar of your house for wasting the time and politics of the <hi

				<p>Elfrida (for that is the fair one's name) and her author<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1698tm" /> are now in town together. He has promised
					me, that he will send a part of it to you some morning while he is there; and (if you shall think it worth while to descend to

					fit for the ears of a <hi rend="italic">tender</hi> parent&#x2013;though, by the way, he has ingenuity and merit enough (whatever his

						sensibility</hi> (as she calls it) lady Vane<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1712tm" /> given you any amusement? Peregrine, whom she uses as a
					vehicle, is very poor indeed with a few exceptions. In the last volume is a character of Mr. Lyttelton, under the name of Gosling

				<p>I am ashamed, but not astonish'd at poor Mr Whithed's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1716tm" /> Insensibility. yet I had settled it with
					myself before, that he would give Mr Chute 500£ a Year, wch I thought at least by half too little. but this was just the Thing, in wch
					Mr Chute neither would, nor could, suggest to him what he ought to do; &amp; so he has done accordingly. I hope, it was only negative
					Ingratitude; but (I own to you) I do suspect, there was a little Reflection in it, &amp; that his Conversations with Mr L:, &amp;
					perhaps with another Person, who knows the Value of Money, better than that of Friendship, might have had their Effect upon his Mind. I
					do not wonder, that Mr Chute is satisfied with every Thing: I even believe, that when Time shall convince him, that Whithed has fall'n
					extremely short in his Acknowledgements to him, it will rather add to his Concern, than diminish it. my best Wishes always accompany
					him; &amp; I can only <hi rend="italic">wish,</hi> that they were of more Consequence. what a Change this Loss will make in his future
					Life! I can only guess at the Extent of it. the Brothers are nasty People,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1717tm" /> that don't deserve
					mentioning. I see <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> sets himself up in his Brother's Room, wch (I hope in God) will considerably reduce
					his Share in the Inheritance.</p>
				<p>You surprise me with the Account you give me of the Alteration in your own Family. what a Man must my Ld O:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1718tm" /> have been, who might so easily have prevented it? I am heartily concerned for the Share you must bear in
					it. sure Your Uncle,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1719tm" /> &amp; Mrs H:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1720tm" /> have it in their Power, if not
					to retrieve, at least much to alleviate, this Misfortune; for from the Mother<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1721tm" /> no body would expect
					anything. perhaps the good Qualities you mention in your Nephew<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1722tm" /> may go farther in repairing his Loss,
					than any of his Relations could have done. from the little I had seen &amp; heard of him, it did not seem probable, that he could
					continue long in the thoughtless Ways of Folly. You were very good, when you found Time to let me know, what I am interested in, not
					barely from Curiosity, but because it touches you so nearly. I can return that kindness no otherwise, than by not taking up your
					Attention longer, when it is so fully employed on your own Affairs.</p>

					he sets out this Week for Bedlam; but if you insist upon it, I don't doubt he will pay his Respects to you. I have seen two of Dr
						M:idns<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1732tm" /> unpublish'd Works. one is about 44 Pages in 4to against Dr Waterland,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1733tm" /> who wrote a very orthodox Book on the Importance of the Doctrine of ye Trinity, &amp; insisted, that
					Christians ought to have no Communion with such as differ from them in Fundamentals. M:idn enters no farther into the Doctrine itself
					than to shew that a mere speculative Point can never be call'd a Fundamental; &amp; that the earlier Fathers, on whose concurrent
					Tradition Wat:d would build, are so far, when they speak of the three Persons, from agreeing with the present Notion of our Church,
					that they declare for the Inferiority of the Son, &amp; seem to have no clear &amp; distinct Idea of the H: Ghost at all. the rest is
					employed in exposing the Folly &amp; Cruelty of Stiffness &amp; Zealotism in Religion, &amp; in shewing that the primitive Ages of the
					Church, in wch Tradition had its Rise, were (even by Confession of the best Scholars &amp; most orthodox Writers) the <hi rend="italic"
						>Æra of Nonsense &amp; Absurdity.</hi> it is finish'd, &amp; very well wrote; but has been mostly incorporated into his other Works,
					particularly the Enquiry: &amp; for this Reason I suppose he has writ upon it, <hi rend="italic">This wholly laid aside.</hi> the
					second is in Latin, on Miracles; to shew, that of the two Methods of defending Christianity, one from its intrinsic Evidence, the
					Holiness and Purity of its Doctrines; the other from its external, the Miracles said to be wrought to confirm it. the first has been
					little attended to by reason of its Difficulty; the second much insisted upon, because it appear'd an easier Task, but that it can in
					reality prove nothing at all. 'Nobilis illa quidem Defensio (the first) quam si obtinere potuissent, rem simul omnem expediisse,

					of the Pagans, compared with those of Xt. I only tell you the Plan, for I have not read it out (tho' it is short) but you will not

				<p>A little kind of Reproach, that I saw the other Day in a Letter of yours to Mr Brown, has made my Guilt fly in my Face, &amp; given
					me Spirit to be a Beast no longer. I desired him to tell you in the beginning of the Summer, that I fear'd my Journey into the North
					would be prevented by the Arrival of my Cousin, Mrs Forster<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1744tm" /> (whom you remember by the Name of
					Pattinson) from India. she came in August; &amp; I continued in Town with her a Month in order to do what little Services I could to a
					Person as strange, &amp; as much to seek, as tho' she had been born in the Mud of the Ganges. after this the Year was too far advanced
					to undertake such an Expedition; &amp; the Thought of seeing you here in the Spring<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1745tm" /> in some measure
					comforts me for the Disappointment; for I depend upon your coming then, when it will be far easier to confer together, &amp; determine
					about a Thing, in wch (I fear) I am too much interes[ted to deserve having]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1746tm" /> any great share in the
						Determination:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1747tm" /> for [ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1748tm" /></p>
				<p> People. you are aware undoubtedly, that a certain Deference, not to say Servility, to the Heads of Colleges is perhaps necessary to
					a Physician, that means to establish himself here: you possibly may find a Method to do without it. another Inconvenience your Wife,
					rather than you, will feel, the Want of Company of her own Sex; as the Women are few here, squeezy &amp; formal, and little skill'd in
					amusing themselves or other People. all I can say is, she must try to make up for it among the Men, who are not over-agreeable neither.
					I much approve of your settling seriously to your Profession; but as your Father is old, if you should lose him, what becomes of your
					Interest, &amp; to whom is it then to be transfer'd? would you leave London &amp; your Practise again to canvas an Election for
						yourself?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1749tm" /> it seems to me, that, if you execute your present Scheme, you must (in case of Mr
						Wh:n's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1750tm" /> Death) entirely lay aside all Views of that Kind. the gradual Transition you propose to make
					thro' Bath or Cambridge to London is very well judged, &amp; likely enough to succeed. for Bath, I am wholly unacquainted with it,
					&amp; consequently can say little to the Purpose. the Way of Life there might be more amusing to Mrs Wharton, than this; but to You, I
					think, would be less satisfactory. I sincerely congratulate you on the good Effects of your new Medecine, wch is indeed a sufficient
					Recompence for any Pains you have taken in that Study. but to make a just Tryal of its Efficacy &amp; of your own Constitution, you
					certainly ought to pass a little Time at London (a Month or so) &amp; that [ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1751tm" /> engaged himself to
					make it up 1000£, in case the Brothers will not do it, &amp; they have (after some Hesitation) refused it.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1752tm" /> our good Mr Brown goes out of his Office<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1753tm" /> today, of wch he is not a little
					glad. his College, wch had much declined for some time, is picking up again: they have had twelve Admissions this Year; &amp; are just
					filling up two Fellowships with a Mr Cardell,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1754tm" /> whom I do not know, but they say, he is a good Scholar;
					&amp; a Mr Delaval,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1755tm" /> a Fellow-Commoner (a younger Son to old Delaval<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1756tm" />
					of Northumberland) who has taken his Degree in an exemplary Manner, &amp; is very sensible, &amp; knowing. the Appeal,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1757tm" /> wch has been so long contended for, will, I believe, at last be yielded to with a good Grace, or rather
					bestowed, by the Advice of the D: of N:, &amp; my Lord Ch:r,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1758tm" /> &amp; will be the best &amp; most
					popular Thing they can do, but you must not mention it, till it is actually done. I am sorry your friend Chapman will lose all the
					Merit of his Pamphlet,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1759tm" /> wch (by the Way) has been answer'd exceedingly well, &amp; with all due
						Contempt.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1760tm" /> he seems much mortified, &amp; was preparing a Reply; but this Event, I doubt, will cut
					him short.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1761tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I know of nothing new in the literary Way, but the History of Lewis, 14th, by Voltaire;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1762tm" /> not that I

					of any of the Contents: but I have a round-about Way, or two in my head: if I succeed, you shall be sure to know immediately; but this

					possibly give you some Reasons, why you ought to have broke t'other Leg &amp; t'other Arm also: for it is too long to stay, till he is

				<p>I do not wonder at their Rage venting itself on Mr Chute.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1769tm" /> they think him easier to come at, &amp;

					had only heard of it from others. it must not be known on any account, that it came from me, for by that means it might easily be
					discover'd, whom I had it from, wch might be the Ruin of a Gentleman. I do not see any one End it can answer, but that of putting Mr C:
					in a silly Light to such, as do not know him. the Exactness of Dates, Hours, &amp; Minutes with the Observation of his different Tones
					of Voice, betray it to be the Work of a Listener, placed on purpose. I am told, that old H:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1774tm" /> does not
					deny his Design of getting her for D: W:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1775tm" /> after my Ld O: had refused her. he insists he was not once
					at C:rs<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1776tm" /> Chambers, while she was in his Hands, &amp; that the Story of the 10,000£ is a manifest Lye.
					he affects to treat it as a Fact asserted by Mr C:, tho' no such thing appears, even in the Paper itself. I can't find for certain,
					that Et:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1777tm" /> (tho he has been here a second time with his Budget) has given any Copies of this Paper
					about, yet I do not doubt but He has. this I know; he has shew'd your Letter to him, &amp; his own Answers to a few People here, tho' I
					have not seen them. I am in hast, but shall write again soon. pray tell me, as soon as you receive this.</p>

					<salute>DEAR SIR &#x2013;</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Very bad! I am YOURS &#x2013; equally bad!<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1780tm" /> it is impossible to conciliate these passages to nature
					and Aristotle.</p>
				<p>
					<hi rend="italic">'Allowed to modern caprice.'</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1781tm" /> &#x2013; It is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> caprice, but good sense that made these alterations in the
					modern Drama. A greater liberty in the choice of the fable, and the conduct of it, was the necessary consequence of retrenching the
						Chorus.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1782tm" /> Love, and tenderness delight in privacy. The soft effusions of the soul, Mr. Mason, will not
					bear the presence of a gaping, singing, dancing, moralizing, uninteresting crowd. And not love alone, but every passion is checked and
					cooled by this fiddling crew. How could Macbeth and his wife have laid the design for Duncan's murder? What could they have said to
					each other in the Hall at midnight, not only if a chorus, but if a single mouse had been stirring there? Could Hamlet have met the
					Ghost, or taken his mother to task in <hi rend="italic">their</hi> company? If Othello had said a harsh word to his wife before <hi
						rend="italic">them,</hi> would they not have danced to the window, and called the watch?</p>
				<p>The ancients were perpetually confined and hampered by the necessity of using the Chorus, and, if they have done wonders
					notwithstanding this clog, sure I am they would have performed still greater wonders without it. For the same reason we may be allowed
					to admit of more intrigue in our drama, to bring about a great action; it is often an essential requisite: and it is not fair to argue
					against this liberty, from that misuse of it, which is common to us, and was formerly so with the French, namely, the giving into a
					silly intricacy of plot, in imitation of the Spanish Dramas. We have also since Charles the Second's time, imitated the French (though
					but awkwardly) in framing scenes of mere insipid gallantry. But these were the faults of the writers, and not of the art, which enables
					us with the help of a little contrivance, to have as much love as we please, without playing the petits maîtres, or building
					labyrinths. </p>
				<p>I forgot to mention that Comedy contrived<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1783tm" /> to be an odd sort of Farce, very like those of the
					Italian theatre, till the Chorus was dismissed. When Nature and Menander brought it into that beautiful form which we find in Terence.
					Tragedy was not so happy till modern times. </p>
				<p>II </p>
				<p>I do not admit that the excellencies of the French writers are measured by the verisimilitude, or the regularities of their Dramas
						<hi rend="italic">only.</hi> Nothing in them, or in our own, even Shakespeare himself, ever touches us, unless rendered <hi
						rend="italic">verisimile,</hi> which by good management may be accomplished even in such absurd stories as the Tempest, the Witches in
					Macbeth, or the Fairies in the Midsummer Night's Dream: and I know not of any writer that has pleased chiefly in proportion to his <hi
						rend="italic">regularity.</hi> Other beauties may indeed be heightened and set off by its means, but of itself it hardly pleases at
					all. Venice Preserved,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1784tm" /> or Jane Shore,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1785tm" /> are not so regular as the
						Orphan,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1786tm" /> or Tamerlane,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1787tm" /> or Lady Jane Grey.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1788tm" />
				</p>
				<p>III </p>
				<p>
					<hi rend="italic">Modern Melpomene.</hi> &#x2013; Here are we got into our tantarums! It is certain that pure poetry may be introduced
					without any Chorus. I refer you to a thousand passages of <hi rend="italic">mere</hi> description in the Iambic parts of Greek
					tragedies, and to ten thousand in Shakespeare, who is moreover particularly admirable in his introduction of pure poetry, so as to join
					it with pure passion, and yet keep close to nature. This he could accomplish with passions the most violent, and transporting, and this
					any good writer may do with passions less impetuous, for it is nonsense to imagine that Tragedy must <hi rend="italic">throughout</hi>
					be agitated with the furious passions, or attached by the tender ones. The greater part of it must often be spent in a preparation of
					these passions, in a gradual working them up to their height, and must thus pass through a great many cooler scenes and a variety of
						<hi rend="italic">nuances,</hi> each of which will admit of a proper degree of poetry, and some the purest poetry. Nay, the boldest
					metaphors, and even description in its strongest colouring, are the natural expression of some passions, even in their greatest
					agitation. As to moral reflections, there is sufficient room for them in those cooler scenes that I have mentioned, and they make the
					greatest ornaments of such parts, that is to say, if they are well joined with the character. If not, they had better be left to the
					audience, than put into the mouths of a set of professed moralists, who keep a shop of sentences, and reflections, (I mean the chorus)
					whether they be sages, as you call them, or young girls that learnt them by heart, out of their samples and primers. </p>
				<p>There is nothing ungracious or improper in Jane Shore's reflections on the fate of women,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1789tm" /> but just
					the contrary, only that they are in rhyme, and in like manner it is far from a beautiful variety when the Chorus makes a transition in
					the &#x2014;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1790tm" /> from plain Iambics to high flown lyric thoughts, expressions and numbers, and when their
					vagaries are over, relapse again into common sense and conversation. A confidante in skilful hands, might be a character, and have both
					sense and dignity. That in Maffei's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1791tm" /> Merope has as much as any Chorus.</p>
				<p>The Greeks might sing better than the French, but I'll be burnt if they <hi rend="italic">danced</hi> with more grace, expression, or
					even pathos, yet who ever thought of shedding tears at a French Opera?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1792tm" />
				</p>
				<p>IV </p>
				<p>If modern music cannot, as you say, express poetry, it is not a perfection, but a deterioration; you might as well say that the <hi
						rend="italic">perfectionment</hi> of poetry would be the rendering it incapable of expressing the passions.</p>

				<p>Your pen was too rapid to mind the common form of a direction, and so, by omitting the words <hi rend="italic">near Windsor,</hi>
					your letter has been diverting itself at another Stoke,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1814tm" /> near Ailesbury, and came not to my hands till
					to-day. The true original chairs were all sold, when the Huntingdons broke;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1815tm" /> there are nothing now but
						Halsey-chairs,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1816tm" /> not adapted to the squareness of a Gothic dowager's rump. And by the way I do not see
					how the uneasiness and uncomfortableness of a coronation-chair can be any objection with you: every chair that is easy is modern, and
					unknown to our ancestors. As I remember, there were certain low chairs, that looked like ebony, at Esher,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1817tm" /> and were old and pretty. Why should not Mr. Bentley improve upon them?&#x2013; I do not wonder at
						Dodsley.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1818tm" /> You have talked to him of six <hi rend="italic">odes,</hi> for so you are pleased to call
					every thing I write, though it be but a receipt to make apple-dumplings. He has reason to gulp when he finds one of them only a long
						story.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1819tm" /> I don't know but I may send him very soon (by your hands) an ode to his own tooth, a high
					Pindarick upon stilts,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1820tm" /> which one must be a better scholar than he is to understand a line of, and the
					very best scholars will understand but a little matter here and there. It wants but seventeen lines of having an end, I don't say of
					being finished. As it is so unfortunate to come too late for Mr. Bentley, it may appear in the fourth volume of the
						Miscellanies,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1821tm" /> provided you don't think it execrable, and suppress it. Pray, when the fine book is to
					be printed, let me revise the press, for you know you can't;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1822tm" /> and there are a few trifles I could wish

					unaffected Devotion, insomuch that I am almost persuaded she indulged Lewis the 14th in no Liberties, till he actually married her,
					&amp; this not out of Policy &amp; Ambition, but Conscience; for she was what we should call a Bigot, yet with great good-sense. in
					short she was too good for a Court; Misfortunes in the beginning of her Life had form'd her Mind (naturally lively &amp; impatient) to
					reflexion, &amp; a habit of piety; she was always miserable, while she had the care of Mad: de Montespan's<anchor

				<p>I am not at all satisfied with the Title. to have it conceived, that I publish a Collection of <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (half
					a dozen little Matters, four of wch too have already been printed again &amp; again) thus pompously adorned would make me appear very
					justly ridiculous. I desire it may be understood (wch is the truth) that the Verses are only subordinate, &amp; explanatory to the
					Drawings, &amp; suffer'd by me to come out thus only for that reason. therefore if you yourself prefix'd this Title, I desire it may be
					alter'd; or if Mr W: order'd it so, that you would tell him, why I wish it were changed in the manner I mention'd to you at first, or
					to that purpose: for the more I consider it, the less I can bear it, as it now stands. I even think, there is an uncommon sort of
					Simplicity, that looks like affectation, in putting our plain Christian &amp; Surnames without a Mr before them;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1860tm" /> but this (if it signifies any thing) I easily give up; the other I can not. you need not apprehend, that
					this Change in the Title will be any prejudice to the Sale of the book. a showy title-page may serve to sell a Pamphlet of a shilling
					or two; but this is not of a price for chance-customers, whose eye is caught in passing by a window; &amp; could never sell but from
					the notion the Town may entertain of the Merit of the Drawings, wch they will be instructed in by some, that understand such
					things.</p>
				<p>I thank you for the Offer you make me, but I shall be contented with three Copies, two of wch you will send me, &amp; keep the third,
					till I acquaint you where to send it. if you will let me know the exact day they will come out a little time beforehand, I will give
					you a direction. you will remember to send two copies to Dr Thomas Wharton, M:D: at Durham. perhaps you may have burnt my Letter, so I
					will again put down the Title </p>

				<p>Sure You are not out of your Wits! this I know, if you suffer my Head to be printed,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1863tm" /> you infallibly
					will put me out of mine. I conjure you immediately to put a stop to any such design. who is at the Expence of engraving it, I know not;
					but if it be Dodsley, I will make up the Loss to him. the thing, as it was, I know will make me ridiculous enough; but to appear in
					proper Person at the head of my works, consisting of half a dozen Ballads in 30 Pages, would be worse than the Pillory. I do assure
					you, if I had received such a Book with such a frontispice without any warning, I believe, it would have given me a Palsy. therefore I
					rejoice to have received this Notice; &amp; shall not be easy, till you tell me all thoughts of it are laid aside. I am extremely in
					earnest, &amp; can't bear even the Idea!</p>
				<p>I had wrote to Dodsley to tell him, how little I liked the Title he had prefix'd, but your letter has put all that out of my Head. if

				<p>I am very sorry that the haste I made to deliver you from your uneasiness the first moment after I received your Letter, shoud have
					made me express myself in a manner to have the quite contrary effect from what I intended. You well know how rapidly and carelessly I
					always write my Letters; the note<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1867tm" /> you mention was written in a still greater hurry than ordinary,
					&amp; merely to put you out of pain. I had not seen Dodsley, consequently coud only tell you that I did not doubt but he woud have no
					Objection to satisfy you, as you was willing to prevent his being a Loser by the plate.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1868tm" /> Now, from
					this declaration how is it possible for you to have for one moment put such a construction upon my words, as woud have been a downright
					stupid brutality, unprovoked? It is impossible for me to recollect my very expression, but I am confident that I have repeated the
					whole substance.</p>
				<p>How the bookseller woud be less a Loser by being at more expense, I can easily explain to you: He feared the price of half a guinea
					woud seem too high to most purchasers; if by the expence of ten guineas more he coud make the book appear so much more rich &amp; showy
					(as I beleive I said) as to induce people to think it cheap, the profits from selling many more copies woud amply recompense him for
					his additional disbursement. </p>
				<p>The thought of having the head engraved was entirely Dodsley's own, &amp; against my opinion, as I concluded it woud be against
					yours, which made me determine to acquaint you with it before it's appearance. </p>
				<p>When you reflect on what I have said now, you will see very clearly, that I had &amp; coud have no other possible meaning in what I
					wrote last. you might justly have accused me of neglect, if I had deferr'd giving you all the satisfaction in my power, as soon as ever
					I knew your uneasiness. </p>
				<p>The Head I give up. The Title I think will be wrong, &amp; not answer your purpose, for, as the Drawings are evidently calculated for
					the poems, why will the improper disposition of the Word <hi rend="italic">Designs</hi> before <hi rend="italic">Poems,</hi> make the
					Edition less yours? I am as little convinced that there is any affectation in leaving out the <hi rend="italic">Mr</hi> before your
					Names; it is a barbarous addition; the other is simple &amp; classic, a rank I cannot help thinking due to both the Poet and Painter.
					Without ranging myself among Classics, I assure you, were I to print any thing with my name, it shoud be plain Horace Walpole: <hi
						rend="italic">Mr</hi> is one of the Gothicisms I abominate.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1869tm" /> The Explanation<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1870tm" /> was certainly added for people who have not Eyes &#x2013; such are almost all who have seen Mr Bentley's
					drawings, &amp; think to compliment him by mistaking them for prints. Alas! the generality want as much to have the words <hi
						rend="italic">a Man, a Cock,</hi> written under his drawings, as under the most execrable hieroglyphics of Egypt or of sign post
					painters!</p>
				<p>I will say no more now, but that you must not wonder if I am partial to you &amp; yours, when you can write as you do &amp; yet feel
					so little Vanity. I have used freedoms enough with your writings to convince you I speak truth: I praise &amp; scold Mr Bentley
					immoderately as I think he draws well or ill; I never think it worth my while to do either, especially to blame, where there are not
					generally vast Excellencies. goodnight &#x2013; dont suspect me when I have no fault but impatience to make you easy. </p>

				<p> You may well suppose me no longer here, as I have neglected thus long to answer two very kind letters, &amp; (wch is more) to

					<salute>Dear Mr. Gray,</salute>
				</opener>
				<p> You have been rightly informd that I have lost a most affectionate Father. I have felt for him, all that a heart not naturally hard,
					&amp; at the time already softend by preceeding anxiety could feel. But my Greiss rest not on him alone, only last tuesday my most
					intimate friend Dr Pricket<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1922tm" /> followd him, a Man who I assure you had more good Qualities of the Heart,
					than the brightest of the Head could outballance either in mine or your estimation, we were brought up together from infancy &amp; ever
					livd in the sincerest affection; in my long illness at London he attended me with a Care and assiduity almost unparralelld. I endeavord
					to repay that Care in my turn but alas his Fate did not give me time to discharge half the debt, yet what I could, I did. </p>
				<p>O Mr Gray how dreadful is it to sit besides a Dying Friend! to see as I did, reason withdraw herself gradually, often return by
					starts, to a Memory evry Minute less capable of furnishing her with Ideas, and a tongue less able to give them utterance. I talk
					nonsence I beleive, but let me do it, it gives me some relief, what makes his Loss to me more deplorable is, that I am afraid either
					the Physician who constantly attended him mistook his Case, or that the other who was calld in afterwards hastend his End, for a sudden
					change ensued the alteration of his medicines. But I will check myself till I see you and then you must bear with me, if I am even a
					Child or a Woman in my complainings. I must add however that in a Will he made five year ago his Friendship bequeathd to me two hundred
					pounds wch when my Debt is dischargd to his executor will be reducd to one, yet the sum will come at present as oportunly as any thing
					of the kind possibly could, as My Father by the Strangest disposition of his affairs that can be conceivd has left all my paternal
					estate to my Mother in Law<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1923tm" /> for her life and entaild it so on my little sister, that I can take up no
					Money upon it, so that without this Legacy I should not have had a Shilling at present. I beleive I shall be obligd to take a journey
					to Mr. Huttons<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1924tm" /> near Richmond and may perhaps be at York next sunday,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1925tm"
					 /> but this is so exceedingly uncertain that I only just name it but would not have you alter your schemes upon it for the sake of a
					meeting. Because my Mother is at present in a fever with three blisters but I hope on the recovery, yet I cannot leave her till there
					appears a greater certainty. Tom<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1926tm" /> has been also in a feavor and got out only to day, therefore I dont
					know whether he'll be in a condition to travel, and I cant easily relinquish the pomp of travelling with a Servt all on a sudden; and
					my Father's Servt, a Lad of the same age, died the week after his Master of a Fever also. from all this you may guess what a time I
					have gone thro lately. yet I am well myself at present except that my hands tremble, and my spiritts often, very often sink. yet have
					they supported me hitherto supprizingly. Pray tell Mr Brown when you see him that I fear I cannot be up at College by the tenth of
						October,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1927tm" /> yet I shall get there as soon as ever I can make any end of my perplext [affairs]<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1928tm" /> here. I wish you had told me how long you would stay in Buckinghamshire I hope it will be short, and that
					we may meet again at Cambridge soon. adieu. My best complmts to Dr Wharton.</p>

				</opener>
				<p> I have just received your Letter, &amp; am both surprized, &amp; angry (if you will suffer me to say so) at the weakness of your
					father. perhaps I ought not to use such words to a person, whose affliction for him is perhaps heighthen'd by that very weakness, for I
					know, it is possible to feel an additional sorrow for the faults of those we have loved, even where that fault has been greatly
					injurious to ourselves. this is certain, he has been (whether from his illness, or some other cause) at least guilty of a great
					weakness; &amp; it is as sure, that there must have been a great fault somewhere, probably in the Person<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1930tm"
					 /> who took advantage of his weakness, upon whom your care &amp; kindness is very ill-bestow'd. tho' you do not at present shew any
					resentment, nor perhaps ever will; at least let me desire you not to expose yourself to any farther danger in the midst of that scene
					of sickness &amp; death, but withdraw as soon as possible to some place at a little distance in the country, for I do not at all like
					the place you are in. I do not attempt to console you on the situation your fortune is left in. if it were far worse; the good opinion
					I have of you tells me, you will never the sooner do anything mean or unworthy of yourself, &amp; consequently I can not pity you on
					this account. but I sincerely do so on the new loss you have had of a good &amp; friendly Man, whose Memory I honour. may I remind you,
					how, like a Simpleton, I used to talk about him? it is foolish to mention it; but it feels I don't know how like a sort of guilt in me:
					tho' I believe you knew, I could not mean any thing by it. I have seen, what you describe, &amp; know how dreadful it is; I know too, I
					am the better for it. we are all idle &amp; thoughtless things, &amp; have no sense, no use in the world any longer than that sad
					impression lasts, the deeper it is engraved, the better. I am forced to break off by the Post.</p>

					<salute>My dear Doctor</salute>
					<dateline>Oct: 18. Stoke.</dateline>
				</opener>
				<p> You will wonder not to have heard sooner of me. the reason has been the instability of my own situation. as soon as I arrived at
						Cambridge,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1934tm" /> I found a letter informing me my Aunt Rogers had had a stroke of the Palsy, so that I
					stay'd only a single day,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1935tm" /> &amp; set out for this place. I found her recover'd surprisingly from the
					greatest danger. her speech only is not yet quite restored; but it is easily intelligible to such as are used to her. is not this
					something extraordinary at seventy seven?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1936tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I met Mason at York, &amp; pass'd that evening<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1937tm" /> with him. [ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1938tm" /> he
					has absolutely no support at present but his fellowship; yet he looks more like a Hero, than ever I knew him, like one that can stare
					poverty in the face without being frighted, &amp; instead of growing little &amp; humble before her, has fortified his Spirit &amp;
					elevated his brow to meet her like a Man. in short if he can hold it, I shall admire him, for I always maintain'd, that no body has
					occasion for Pride but the Poor, &amp; that every where else it is a sign of folly. my journey was not so bad as usual in a
					Stage-Coach. there was a Lady Swinburne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1939tm" /> a Roman-Catholick, not young, that had been much abroad,
					seen a great deal, knew a great many people, very chatty &amp; communicative, so that I pass'd my time very well; &amp; on the third
					day left them at Stilton, &amp; got to Cambridge that night. as I know, &amp; have heard mighty little to entertain you with, I can
					only tell you my observations on the face of the Country &amp; the Season in my way hither, that you may compare them with what you see
					at Durham. till I came to York I thought the face of every thing rather alter'd for the worse, certainly not better than that corner of
					the Bishoprick about Darlington. at Topcliff<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1940tm" /> I saw a large Vine full of black Grapes, that seemd
					ripe. at Helperby<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1941tm" /> met a flock of Geese <hi rend="italic">in full song.</hi> if their person had not
					betray'd them, one might have taken them for Nightingales. at York Walnuts ripe, 20 for a penny. from thence, especially South of
					Tadcaster, I thought the Country extremely beautiful, broke into fine hills cover'd with noble woods, (particularly toward the East)
					&amp; every thing as verdant almost, as at Midsummer. this continued to Doncaster; the Hazle &amp; White-thorn were turning yellow in
					the hedges, the Sycamore, Lime, &amp; Ash (where it was young, or much exposed) were growing rusty, but far greener than in your
					County. The old Ash, the Oak, &amp; other Timber shew'd no signs of winter. some few of the Lands were in stubble, but for the most
					part they were plough'd up, or cover'd with Turneps. I find Mr Evelyn in his book of Forest-trees<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1942tm" />
					publish'd in Q: Anne's time takes notice 'That Shropshire &amp; several other Counties, and rarely any beyond Stamford to Durham, have
					the Vernacula, (or French Elm) or the Mountain-Elm, (wch is what you call the English Elm,) growing for many miles together.' I cannot
					say I saw any, but about Scrubey<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1943tm" /> in Nottinghamshire, &amp; they were young ones newly planted near a
					hedge-row. he also mentions 'the Elm of a more scabrous Leaf, harsh, &amp; very large, wch [ ] for my part, [ ] o sort [ ]<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1944tm" /> at least of any size, or growing in a wild way, till I came into Northamptonshire. I thought the winter
					more advanced in Lincolnshire, &amp; so on, till I had pass'd Huntingdon, than it was in the W: Riding of Yorkshire. in
					Northamptonshire I first observed the appearances of a long drougth, wch continued quite hither. the Turf is every where brown &amp;
					burnt up, as in Italy, even the low Meadows want their usual verdure. at Cambridge the finest Grapes I ever saw there; the Lime-trees
					were only changing colour, but had drop'd few of their leaves. in the smoke of London they had almost lost their old leaves, but made
					fresh shoots, as green as in April. &amp; here before my window are two young Sycamores, wch have done the same, but still retain all
					their old leaves too without any change of colour. at Trompington the new Rye was green in the fields, &amp; three inches high. it is
					the same in this County. we are here upon a Loam with a bed of Gravel below, &amp; Ragstone beneath that. the Hay is usually all in by
					old Midsummer this year it was all cut by new Mids:r,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1945tm" /> but a great deal of it lost for want of rain,
					wch likewise spoil'd the Tares &amp; Peas. in the beginning of August was rain for near three weeks, wch saved the Corn. Oats were in
					some places cut before the wheat, wch was all got in by the 20th of August. Barley, Beans, &amp;c; by the 7th of Septr. I came hither
					the 6th of October, &amp; they had then within a mile of the Thames (where the soil is better, than here) begun to sow wheat. for six
					weeks before my arrival it had been continued fine weather, &amp; the air till Sunset was like July. never almost was such a year known
					for fruit. the Nectarines &amp; best Peaches had been all gather'd three weeks before. the Grapes were then perfectly ripe, &amp; still
					continue the best I ever eat in England. Oct: 9th it began to rain, &amp; we have had showers every day since, with brisk winds in the
					S: &amp; S:W:; today it is in the North, clear sunshine, but cold &amp; a little wintry: &amp; so ends my Georgick in prose. excuse me,
					if I had nothing better to send you. it is partly from my own eyesight, &amp; partly from the report of such as have no prejudices in
					favour of their county, because they hardly know, there is any other. </p>
				<p>I write chiefly to draw on a letter from you, for I am impatient to know many things; but remember, this election time<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1946tm" /> letters are apt to be open'd at the offices. pray, make my sincere acknowledgements to my <hi rend="italic"

				<p> I am not in a way of leaving this place yet this fortnight, &amp; consequently shall hardly see you in town. I rejoice in the mean
					time to think, that you are there, &amp; have left (I hope) a part of your disagreable reflections in the place, where they grew. Stoke
					has revived in me the memory of many a melancholy hour, that I have pass'd in it,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1949tm" /> &amp; tho' I have
					no longer the same cause for anxiety, I do not find myself at all the happier for thinking, that I have lost it. as my thoughts now
					signify nothing to any one, but myself, I shall wish to change the scene, as soon as ever I can.</p>
				<p>I am heartily glad to hear Mr Hutton<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1950tm" /> is so reasonable, but am rather sorry to find that
						design<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1951tm" /> is known to so many. Dr Wharton, who (I suppose) heard it from Avison,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1952tm" /> mentions it in a letter to me. were I you, I should have taken some pleasure in observing people's faces,
					&amp; perhaps in putting their kindness a little to the tryal. it is a very useful experiment; &amp; very possibly you will never have
					it in your power to put it in practise again. pray, make your bargain with all the circumspection, &amp; selfishness of an old Hunks;
					when you are grown as rich as Crœsus, do not grow too good-for-nothing. a little good-for-nothing to be sure you will grow: every body
					does in proportion to their circumstances, else indeed what should one do with one's money? my third <hi rend="italic">Sentence</hi>
					is, don't anticipate your revenues, &amp; live upon air, till you know what you are worth. you bid me write no more than a scrall to
					you, therefore I will trouble you, as you are so busy, with nothing more. </p>

				<p>You are to dispatch forthwith an Express to Angers to fetch the windows of St Bonaventure's Chappel in the Church of the Cordeliers
					there; in them are painted Margaret of Anjou herself kneeling; her Mother Isabella, Dutchess of Lorraine, first Wife of René, K: of
					Sicily; Joan de la Val, his second wife; Yolande, his eldest daughter, also D:ss of Lorraine; &amp; John, Duke of Calabria, his eldest
					Son. these are not mobbled Queens<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1968tm" /> upon a tomb, but fair &amp; flourishing figures with entire faces:
					the hair of the four Women is dishevel'd below their girdle, wch one would think was a fashion peculiar to them, for no other
					cotemporary Lady have I ever seen, that did not wear hers trussed up &amp; plaited, or quite hid. to stay your stomach till the return
					of the Courier, you may see them all in Montfaucon's Antiquities, (Tom: 3. Plates 47, &amp; 63.) I think you have the Book, &amp; pray

				<p>Now you are to determine whether the Picture represent the marriage at Tours, (wch may be; &amp; yet Henry 6th may be introduced,

					accompanied Margaret to England. they took leave of her at Bar-le-Duc with abundance of tears, &amp; at Rouen she was consign'd to her

					vestus de robes &amp; de chaperons noirs, chargez d'orfevrerie d'argent doré, qui estoient tous fils de Chevaliers; &amp; menoit le
					premier Page par la main une haquenée de son costé dextre, que ledit Roy d'Anglet:e envoyoit a la Reyne sa femme, ornée d'une selle
					&amp; de paremens, tels que le tout en estoit de fin or, &amp; les paremens des autres haquenées estoient tous d'argent doré. aprés
					suivoit le chariot, que le dit Roy lui envoyoit, lequel estoit le plus richement orné &amp; paré que depuis trés long tems il n'en
					estoit party du Royaume d'Ang:re un pareil; car il estoit couvert d'un trés riche drap d'or, &amp; armoyé des armes de France &amp;
					d'Angleterre: lequel chariot estoit tiré par 6 chevaux blancs de grand prix, &amp; estoit icelui chariot figuré par dedans &amp; dehors
					de plusieurs &amp; diverses couleurs, dans lequel estoient la Comtesse de Suffort, les Dames de Talbot, &amp; de Salsebery, &amp;
					estoit ladite Comtesse en l'estat de la Reyne pareil au jour qu'elle espousa. les autres dames ensuivans de degré en degré venoient
					aprés ce chariot montées sur haquenées. au plus prés d'icelui chariot estoit le Duc d'Jorcq d'un costé, &amp; le Sgr de Talbot de
					l'autre, tenant maniere et contenance, comme si la Reyne eust eté dedans. le Comte de Suffort alloit chevauchant devant le chariot
					representant la personne du Roy d'Ang:rre, &amp; aprés luy il y avoit 36 tant chevaux qu'haquenées de grand parage tous housséz de
					vermeil armoyé de ses armes. aprés icelui chariot il y avoit encore 5 chevaux richement ornéz, dont 2 estoient couverts de velours
					vermeil battu à or, seméz de roses d'or dedans, &amp; les autres estoient couverts de drap de damas cramoisy. aprés tout ce que dit
					est, venoit encore un chariot richement orné, dedans lequel estoient la Dame de Talbot la jeune, la Dame Marg:e Hoult, &amp; autres,
					lesquelles estoient toutes ordonnées &amp; destinées pour recevoir icelle nouvelle Reyne d'Angleterre.' (Matth:u de Coucy;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.1987tm" /> a Cotemp:ry p. 553).</p>
				<p>Out of these, if the Scene of the Picture lies in England, you may pick &amp; chuse; for it is likely they all waited upon her to
					Southwick. I am sorry Duke Humphrey could not be there, but you see he did not meet her till after the marriage in her way to London.
					much less could his Wife Jaqueline appear, as that marriage was set aside 18 years before: indeed his Dutchess Eleanor Cobham was now
					in prison, &amp; had been so (in spite of Shakespear<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1988tm" /> ) 3 or 4 years, before Margaret came over. the
					Cardinal Beaufort, then at least 70 years old, one would think should have the honour of joining their hands, especially in his own
					Diocese; but I recollect no marks of a Cardinal, &amp; what I take for the Pallium, wch he holds over their hands, is (I believe)
					peculiar to Archbishops: so it may be John Stafford, Archb:p of Canterbury, who certainly crown'd her the next month. I could tell you
					many small particulars, as the name of the Ship she came over in, wch was <hi rend="italic">Coq Johan de Charburgh</hi>; Thomas Adams,
					Master. the Ring she was married with, wch was a <hi rend="italic">fair Ruby, sometime yeven unto us</hi> (says the King) <hi
						rend="italic">by our bel Oncle the Cardinal of Englande, with the wch we were sacred in the day of our Coronacion at Parys, &amp; wch
						was broke, thereof to make another ring for the Quene's wedding.</hi> the Jewels he gave for New-year's gifts before the marriage to
					the D: of Gloucester, the Cardinal, the D: of Exeter, the Archbishop, Dutchess of Buckingham, Earl of Warwick, &amp;c: the George he
					wore himself, wch cost 2000 Marks; <hi rend="italic">the Puson of Golde, call'd Iklyngton Coler, garnish'd with 4 Rubees, 4 greet
						Saphurs, 32 greet Perles &amp; 53 other Perles; &amp; the</hi>
					<hi rend="italic">Pectoral of Golde garnished with rubees, perles &amp; diamondes; &amp; also the greet Owche garnished with diamondes,
						rubees &amp; perles, that cost 2000 Marcs, wch the Quene wore at the solempnitee of hir Coronation.</hi> if these suit your palate,
					you may see them all, &amp; many other curious Papers, in Rymer's Fœdera, V: 11. some dated from the Priory of Southwyk, &amp;
					witness'd by the Marquess of Suffolk, the Tresorer of Englande (wch was Sr Ralph Boteler, Ld Sudeley,) &amp; the Privy-Seal (Adam
					Moleyns, Dean of Salisbury, afterwards Bishop of Chichester, &amp; murther'd by the Mob at Southampton).</p>
				<p>Now I shall set down the ages of the parties concern'd. the King was barely 23 years old. (what shall we do with this stubborn date?)
					the Queen was in her 15th Year. her mother Isabella was probably about 35. René, her father, was 36. (see his picture, when old; done
					by himself, in Montfaucon). Mary, Q: of France, her aunt, was 40 (see her, ibid: with a very odd face, an odder Coif, &amp; high, but
					not pointed bonnet, from an original) Charles the 7th of France was 41. (see him in the same plate). John, her brother, D: of Calabria,
					was about 19. Yolande, her Sister, was not a year older than herself. </p>
				<p>There is so particular a description of the dresses in use about the middle of the 15th Century extant, that (long as it is) I must
					send it you. 'En ceste année delaisserent les dames &amp; damoiselles les queues a porter a leurs robes: &amp; en ce lieu meirent
					bordures a leurs robbes de gris de lestices, de martres, de veloux &amp; d'autres choses si larges, comme d'un veloux de haut ou plus.
					&amp; si meirent sur leurs tetes bourrelets a maniere de bonnet rond, qui s'amenuisoient par dessus de la hauteur de demie aulne, ou de
					trois quartiers de long tels y avoit: &amp; aucunes les portoient moindres, &amp; deliez couvrechess par dessus pendans par derriere
					jusques a terre, les aucuns &amp; les autres: &amp; prindrent aussi a porter leurs ceintures de soye plus larges beaucoup qu'elles
					n'avoient accoutumé &amp; de diverses façons; &amp; les ferrures plus somptueuses assez, &amp; coliers d'or a leurs cols autrement
					&amp; plus cointement beaucoup qu'elles n'avoient accoutumé. et en ce temps aussi les hommes se prindrent a vestir plus court, qu'ils
					n'eurent onques fait; tellement que l'on veoit la façon de leurs culs &amp; de leurs genitoires, ainsi comme l'en souloit vestir les
					singes, qui estoit chose tres malhonnête &amp; impudique. &amp; si faisoient les manches fendre de leurs robbes &amp; de leurs
					pourpoints pour monstrer leurs chemises deliées, larges, &amp; blanches. portoient aussi leurs cheveux si longs, qu'ils leur
					empêchoient leurs visages, mesmement leurs yeux. &amp; sur leurs testes portoient bonnets de drap hauts &amp; longs d'un quartier ou
					plus. portoient aussi, comme tous indifferemment, chaines d'or moult somptueuses chevaliers &amp; escuyers: les varlets mêmes,
					pourpoints de soye, de satin &amp; de veloux. et presque tous, especiallement és cours des Princes, portoient poulaines a leurs
					soulliers d'un quartier de long; et á leurs pourpoints gros mahoitres á leurs espaules pour monstrer, qu'ils fussent larges par les
					espaules; qui sont choses moult vaines, &amp; par adventure fort haineuses a Dieu. &amp; qui estoit huy court vestu, il estoit le
					lendemain long vestu jusques a terre.' </p>
				<p>(Monstrelet.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1989tm" /> V: 3. aprés P: 130).</p>
				<p>The Date he assigns to these new fashions is 1467. yet it is sure the sugar-loaf caps, the long close Hose, &amp; long-pointed shoes,
					are seen in paintings a good while before. as in Montfaucon, (V: 3. Plate 46.) where one of the Lords has a Hawk on his fist, <hi
						rend="italic">marque d'une grande qualité dans ces tems lá.</hi> Charles the 6th used to go to Council, <hi rend="italic">l'epervier
						sur le poing.</hi> (ibid: p. 189.) Mary, the Heiress of Burgundy, is the last Lady with a high Cap that I meet with. she died 1481,
					&amp; from what I recollect of the dresses in your picture, they are all older than that date, for about this time very different
					fashions came in. I even believe it was painted soon after 1445, &amp; the Glory about the King's head might be added afterwards; tho'
					Jo: Blackman,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1990tm" /> a Carthusian, who has wrote a short account, as an eye-witness, of Henry 6th's private
					Life, treats him already as a sort of Saint. the Pomegranates are only a fashionable Pattern for Embroidery &amp; Brocades about that
					time. Philip, D: of Burgundy made his entry into Ghent in such a robe, &amp; Charles the 7th into Paris (V: 3. Pl: 39, &amp; 45.)
					&amp;c:</p>
				<p>This is what I have yet met with to your purpose at all, tho' perhaps little to your satisfaction, with regard to that picture. now
					for the other,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1991tm" /> I must tell you my disappointment, wch has been the reason why I have made you &amp;
						<hi rend="italic">the world</hi> wait so long for this first volume of my Antiquities. a Senior-Fellow of Trinity, I was told, had got
					a Mss, in wch were painted Henry 7th, &amp; many of his court: he was absent, &amp; I have stayed with impatience for a sight of it: I
					have now met with him, but the painting is at his living in Cheshire. it is not a Mss, but a Roll of Vellom, as long as the Room (he
					says) in wch are represented that King and all his Lords going to Parliament. this must be a great curiosity, but we are not like to be
					the better for it. another disappointment! in reading Thomas of Otterbourne's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.1992tm" /> Chronicle I found
					mention of a Sainte-Ampoule kept in Westm:r Abbey. he speaks of Henry 4th's being inunctus sancto oleo, quod S: <hi rend="italic"
						>Thomæ</hi> martyri dedit beatiss:a Virgo Maria in exilio ejus. this seem'd to account for S: Thomas' attending Elizabeth of York as
					the future anointed Queen of England. but alas! on second thoughts these words must mean S: Thomas Becket.</p>
				<p>Immediately after the Battle of Bosworth, Aug: 22, 1485, the King sent Sr Rob: Willoughby to the Castle of Sheriff-Hutton in
					Yorkshire with orders to conduct the Princess Eliz:th to her Mother at London. he himself enter'd the City 5 days after; was crown'd,
					Oct: 30, by Cardl Tho: Bourchier, Archbp of Canterbury, &amp; married Jan: 18, 1486, at Westminster, being then in his 31st year, &amp;
					Elizabeth turn'd of 20. he (you see) is in his kingly ornaments; but he would not suffer her to be crown'd till almost two years after,
					when she had brought him a Son. if you are sure the Person who accompanies the King is a Cardinal, it must be Bourchier, who died very
					soon after this marriage, for the Writ, de custodiâ commissâ to Jo: Morton, Bp of Ely, who succeeded him, is dated July 13. 1486.
					Bourchier was not Legate de latere, but perhaps may bear the Legatine double-Cross as Archb: of Canterbury; for both our Archbishops
					were styled <hi rend="italic">Apostolicæ Sedis Legati</hi> (see Rymer. V: 12. p. 208 &amp; 245.) but I take the Person there
					represented to be James, Bishop of Imola, who granted the Dispensation for this marriage (they being in the 4th degree of Consanguinity
					to one another) &amp; was then <hi rend="italic">Orator &amp; Commissarius cum potestate Legati de latere in regnis Angliæ et
						Scotiæ.</hi> (see the Bull, in Rymer, V: 12. p. 213.) and somewhere, tho' I can not turn to the place, I found the King returning the
					Pope thanks for honouring the solemnity with the presence of his <hi rend="italic">Ambassador.</hi> 'tis true, this Legate was no
					Cardinal, but (I believe) as Legate he might wear the Purple: tho' I am not sure, his dress is any thing more, than a Dr in Divinity's
					scarlet robe, &amp; the hood, as usual, lined with Meniver. it is certain, there is no hat, tho' this was the distinction of a Cardinal
					long before these times.</p>

				<p> I am very glad my objections serve only to strengthen your first opinion about the subject of your picture:<anchor

				<p>Whether this is wit only, or a censure upon Dugdale's work, or upon the Heraldry added to it, I leave you to judge. the arms were

				<p>Having been some little time absent from hence<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2009tm" /> I missed of your letter, or I had answer'd it as
					soon as you desire me. the opportunity of a good House<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2010tm" /> I hope you will not suffer to escape you.
					whether the rent be too high, you alone can properly judge. there is great comfort to be sure in a good house. some appearance of
					Œconomy I should think would give you credit in that part of the town you are to be well with: they pride themselves in living much
					within their income. upon the whole I seem to have a partiality for Mr Crumpe, but be sure never to repent. if you think, you shall, by
					all means settle yourself in the great house. besides I do not know but some great old Doctor may come &amp; squat himself down there
					at your elbow (for I suppose there may be some convenience in succeeding to a house of the same Profession) &amp; then you would be
					horridly out of humour. in short you see with your own eyes, you know the Quarter, &amp; must necessarily be best qualified to decide.
					Dr Fothergill's<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2011tm" /> invitation is very civil. as to the depth of Science, wch you seem to dread, it
					always grows shallower, as one comes nearer, tho' it makes a great noise at a distance. the design of the Society<anchor

						xml:id="id_tg1a.2013tm" /> I should think the same reason, that makes Heb:n<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2014tm" /> withdraw himself, should
					prevent your admission into it: it will be easy to delay it however on various pretences without disobliging any one.</p>
				<p>I am glad you agree with me in admiring Mr Southcote's Paradise,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2015tm" /> wch whenever you see it again,

					again. he is a simple old Phobus,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2024tm" /> but nothing can spoil so glorious a situation, wch surpasses every
					thing round it. I take it ill, you should say any thing against ye Mole.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2025tm" /> it is a reflection, I see,
					cast at the Thames. do you think, that Rivers, wch have lived in London &amp; its neighbourhood all their days, will run roaring &amp;
					tumbling about, like your Tramontane Torrents in the North. no, they only glide &amp; whisper. in your next expedition you will see
						Claremont,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2026tm" /> &amp; Ld Portmore's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2027tm" /> wch joins my Ld Lincoln's,<anchor

					what it must be in the North. I suppose the roads are impassable with the deep snow still.</p>
				<p>I could write abundance more, but am afraid of losing this Post. pray, let me hear from you as soon as you can, &amp; make my

				<p>I rejoice to find you at last settled<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2034tm" /> to your heart's content, &amp; delight to hear you talk of
						<hi rend="italic">giving your house some Gothic ornaments</hi> already. if you project any thing, I hope it will be entirely within
					doors; &amp; don't let me (when I come gaping into Coleman-street<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2035tm" />) be directed to the Gentleman's at
					the ten Pinnacles, or with the Church-porch at his door. I am glad you enter into the Spirit of Strawberry-Castle. it has a purity
					&amp; propriety of Gothicism in it (with very few exceptions,) that I have not seen elsewhere. the eating-room &amp; library<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2036tm" /> were not compleated, when I was there, &amp; I want to know, what effect they have. my Ld Radnor's
						Vagaries<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2037tm" /> (I see) did not keep you from doing justice to his situation, wch far surpasses every thing
					near it, &amp; I do not know a more <hi rend="italic">laughing</hi> Scene, than that about Twickenham &amp; Richmond. Dr
						Akenside<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2038tm" /> (I perceive) is no Conjurer<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2039tm" /> in Architecture, especially
					when he talks of the Ruins of Persepolis, wch are no more Gothic, than they are Chinese. the Egyptian Style (see Dr Pococke,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2040tm" /> not his discourses, but his prints) was apparently the Mother of ye Greek; &amp; there is such a similitude
					between the Egyptian, &amp; those Persian Ruins, as gave room to Diodorus<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2041tm" /> to affirm, that the old
					buildings of Persia were certainly perform'd by Egyptian Artists. as to the other part of his opinion, that the Gothic manner is the
					Saracen or Moorish, he has a great Authority to support him, that of Sr Christ:r Wren,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2042tm" /> &amp; yet (I
					can not help thinking) is undoubtedly wrong. the Palaces in Spain I never saw but in description, wch gives us little or no Idea of
					things; but the Doge's Palace at Venice I have seen<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2043tm" /> (wch is in the Arabesque manner) &amp; the houses
					of Barbary you may see in Dr Shaw's book,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2044tm" /> not to mention abundance of other eastern Buildings in
					Turky, Persia, &amp;c: that we have views of, &amp; they seem plainly to be corruptions of the Greek Architecture, broke into little
					parts indeed, &amp; cover'd with little ornaments, but in a taste very distinguishable from that we call Gothic. there is one thing,
					that runs thro' the Moorish Buildings, that an Imitator would certainly have been first struck with, &amp; would have tried to copy,
					&amp; that is the Cupola's, wch cover everything, Baths, Apar[t]ments, &amp; even Kitchens. yet who ever saw a Gothic Cupola? it is a
					thing plainly of Greek original. I do not see any thing but the slender Spires, that serve for steeples, wch may perhaps be borrowed
					from the Saracen Minarets on their Mosques.</p>
				<p>I was in Northamptonshire,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2045tm" /> when I received your Letter, but am now returned hither. I have been at
					Warwick, wch is a place worth seeing. the Town is on an eminence surrounded every way with a fine cultivated Valley, thro' wch the Avon
					winds, &amp; at the distance of 5 or 6 miles, a circle of hills well wooded, &amp; with various objects crowning them, that close the
					Prospect. out of the town on one side of it rises a rock, that might remind one of your rocks at Durham, but that it is not so savage,
					or so lofty, &amp; that the river, wch washes its foot, is perfectly clear, &amp; so gentle, that its current is hardly visible. upon
					it stands the Castle, the noble old residence of the Beauchamps &amp; Neville's, &amp; now of Earl Brooke.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2046tm" /> he has sash'd the great Appartment, that's to be sure, (I can't help these things) &amp; being since told,
					that square sash-windows were not Gothic, he has put certain whim-wams withinside the glass, wch appearing through are to look like
					fretwork. then he has scooped out a little Burrough in the massy walls of the place for his little self &amp; his children,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2047tm" /> wch is hung with Paper &amp; printed Linnen, &amp; carved chimney-pieces, in the exact manner of
					Berkley-square or Argyle-Buildings. what in short can a Lord do now a days, that is lost in a great old solitary Castle, but sculk
					about, &amp; get into the first hole he finds, as a Rat would do in like case. a pretty long old stone-bridge leads you into the town
					with a Mill at the end of it, over wch the rock rises with the Castle upon it with all its battlements &amp; queer ruin'd towers, &amp;
					on your left hand the Avon strays thro' the Park, whose ancient Elms seem to remember Sr Philip Sidney,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2048tm"
					 /> (who often walk'd under them) and talk of him to this day. the Beauchamp Earls of Warwick<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2049tm" /> lie
					under stately Monuments in the Choir of the great Church, &amp; in our Lady's Chappel adjoining to it. there also lie Ambrose Dudley,
					E: of Warwick;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2050tm" /> &amp; his Brother, the famous Ld Leicester, with Lettice, his Countess.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2051tm" /> this Chappel is preserved entire, tho' the Body of the Church was burnt down 60 years ago, &amp; rebuilt by
					Sr C: Wren. I had heard often of Guy-Cliff two miles from the town, so I walked to see it; &amp; of all improvers commend me to Mr
						Greathead,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2052tm" /> its present Owner. he shew'd it me himself, &amp; is literally a fat young Man with a
					head &amp; face much bigger than they are usually worn. it was naturally a very agreeable rock, whose Cliffs cover'd with large trees
					hung beetleing over the Avon, wch twists twenty ways in sight of it. there was the Cell of Guy, Earl of Warwick, cut in the living
					stone, where he died a Hermit<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2053tm" /> (as you may see in a penny History, that hangs upon the rails in
						Moorfields)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2054tm" /> there were his fountains bubbling out of the Cliff; there was a Chantry founded to his
					memory in Henry the 6th's time.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2055tm" /> but behold the Trees are cut down to make room for flowering shrubs,
					the rock is cut up, till it is as smooth &amp; as sleek as sattin; the river has a gravel-walk by its side; the Cell is a Grotta with
						cockle-shells<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2056tm" /> and looking-glass; the fountains have an iron-gate before them, and the Chantry is a
					Barn, or a little House.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2057tm" /> even the poorest bits of nature, that remain, are daily threatned, for he
					says (&amp; I am sure, when the Greatheads are once set upon a thing, they will do it) he is determined, it shall be <hi rend="italic"
						>all new.</hi> These were his words, &amp; they are Fate. I have also been at Stow,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2058tm" /> at Woburn<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2059tm" /> (the Du[ke] of Bedford's), and at Wroxton<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2060tm" /> (Ld Guilford's) but I defer
					these Chapt[ers] till we meet. I shall only tell you for your Comfort, that th[e] part of Northampt:re, where I have been, is in
					fruits, in flowers [&amp; in] corn very near a fortnight night behind this part of Buckinghamshire, that they have no nightingales,
					&amp; that the other birds are almost as silent, as at Durham. it is rich land, but upon a Clay, &amp; in a very bleak, high, exposed
					situation. I hope, you have had some warm weather, since you last complained of the South. I have thoughts of seeing you about
					Michaelmas, tho' I shall not stay long in town. I should have been at Camb:ge before now, if the D: of Newc:le &amp; his
						foundation-stone<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2061tm" /> would have let me, but I want them to have done before I go.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2062tm" /> I am sorry Mr Brown should be the only one, that has stood upon Punctilio's with me, &amp; would not write
					first. pray tell him so. Mason is (I believe) in town, or at Chiswick.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2063tm" /> [no news of Tuthill]:<anchor

				<p> I am clear, that you are in the right way &amp; that you ought to make your excuses at the Queen's Arms<anchor

					<p>ODE, IN THE GREEK MANNER<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2073tm" /></p>
					<p>Strophe 1. </p>
					<p>Awake, Æolian lyre, awake, <lb /> And give to transport all thy trembling strings! <lb /> From Helicon's harmonious springs <lb /> A
						thousand rills their mazy progress take:<lb /> The laughing Flowers, that round them blow, <lb /> Drink life &amp; fragrance, as they
						flow. <lb /> Now the rich stream of musick winds along <lb /> Deep, majestic, smooth, and strong, <lb /> Thro' verdant vales, &amp;
						Ceres' golden reign: <lb /> Now rolling down the steep amain <lb /> With torrent-rapture see it pour; <lb /> The Rocks &amp; nodding
						Groves rebellow to the roar. </p>
					<p>(Antistrophe 1.) </p>
					<p>Oh Sovereign of the willing Soul, <lb /> Parent of sweet &amp; solemn-breathing airs, <lb /> Enchanting Shell! the sullen Cares;
						<lb /> And frantic Passions hear thy soft controul. <lb /> On Thracia's hills the Lord of war <lb /> Has curb'd the fury of his car,
						<lb /> And drop'd his thirsty lance at thy command. <lb /> Perching on the sceptred hand <lb /> Of Jove thy magick lulls the feather'd
						King <lb /> With ruffled plumes, &amp; flagging wing; <lb /> Quench'd in black clouds of slumber lie <lb /> The terrour of his beak,
						&amp; light'nings of his eye. </p>
					<p>Epode 1. </p>
					<p>Thee the Voice, the Dance, obey <lb /> Temper'd to thy warbled lay. <lb /> O'er Idalia's velvet-green <lb /> The rosy-crowned Loves
						are seen <lb /> On Cytherea's day <lb /> With antick Sports, &amp; blew-eyed Pleasures, <lb /> Frisking light in frolick measures:
						<lb /> Now pursuing, now retreating, <lb /> Now in circling troops they meet; <lb /> To brisk notes the cadence beating <lb /> Glance
						their many-twinkling feet. <lb /> Slow melting strains the Queen's approach declare;<lb /> Wher'e'er she turns, the Graces homage pay,
						<lb /> With arms sublime, that float upon the air, <lb /> In gliding state she wins her easy way. <lb /> O'er her warm cheek &amp;
						rising bosom move <lb /> The bloom of young Desire, &amp; purple light of Love. </p>
					<p>(Strophe 2da.) </p>
					<p>Man's feeble race what Ills await, <lb /> Labour &amp; Penury, the racks of Pain, <lb /> Disease, and Sorrow's weeping Train, <lb />
						And Death, sad refuge from the storms of Fate? <lb /> The fond complaint, my Song, disprove, <lb /> And justify the laws of Jove.
						<lb /> Say, has he given in vain the heavenly Muse? <lb /> Night, &amp; all her sickly Dews, <lb /> Her Spectres wan, and Birds of
						boding cry, <lb /> He gives to range the dreary sky: <lb /> Till fierce Hyperion from afar <lb /> Pours on their scatter'd rear his
						glitt'ring shafts of war. </p>
					<p>(Antistrophe 2da.) </p>
					<p>In climes beyond the solar road, <lb /> Where shaggy Forms o'er ice-built mountains roam, <lb /> The Muse has broke the
						twilight-gloom <lb /> To chear the shivering Native's dull abode; <lb /> And oft beneath the od'rous shade <lb /> Of Chili's boundless
						forests laid <lb /> She deigns to hear the savage Youth repeat <lb /> In loose numbers wildly sweet <lb /> Their feather-cinctured
						Chiefs &amp; dusky Loves. <lb /> Her track wher'e'r the Goddess roves, <lb /> Glory pursue, and generous Shame, <lb /> Th'
						unconquerable Mind, &amp; Freedom's holy flame. </p>
					<p>(Epode 2da.) </p>
					<p>Woods, that wave o'er Delphi's steep, <lb /> Isles, that crown th' Egæan deep, <lb /> Fields, that cool Ilissus laves, <lb /> Or
						where Mæander's amber-waves <lb /> In ling'ring labyrinths creep, <lb /> How do your tuneful Ecchoes languish <lb /> Mute, but to the
						voice of Anguish? <lb /> Where each old poetic Mountain <lb /> Inspiration breath'd around; <lb /> Every Shade &amp; hallow'd Fountain
						<lb /> Murmur'd deep a solemn sound: <lb /> Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour <lb /> Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains.
						<lb /> (Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant Power, <lb /> And coward Vice, that revels in her chains.) <lb /> When Latium had her
						lofty spirit lost, <lb /> They sought, oh Albion, next thy sea-encircled coast. </p>
					<p>(Strophe 3a.) </p>
					<p>Far from the Sun and summer-gale <lb /> In thy green lap was Nature's Darling laid, <lb /> What time, where lucid Avon stray'd,
						<lb /> To him the mighty Mother did unveil <lb /> Her aweful face: the dauntless Child <lb /> Stretch'd forth his little arms, &amp;
						smiled. <lb /> 'This pencil take, (she said) whose colours clear <lb /> 'Richly paint the vernal Year. <lb /> 'Thine too these golden
						keys, immortal Boy, <lb /> 'This can unlock the gates of Joy: <lb /> 'Of Terror that, &amp; thrilling Fears; <lb /> 'Or ope the sacred
						Source of sympathetic tears. </p>
					<p>(Antistrophe 3a.) </p>
					<p>Nor second He, that rode sublime <lb /> Upon the seraph-wings of Extasy <lb /> The secrets of th' Abyss to spy. <lb /> He pass'd the
						flaming bounds of Place &amp; Time. <lb /> The living Throne, the sapphire-Blaze, <lb /> Where Angels tremble while they gaze, <lb />
						He saw: but blasted with excess of light, <lb /> Closed his eyes in endless night. <lb /> Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous car
						<lb /> Wide o'er the fields of Glory bear <lb /> Two Coursers of ethereal race <lb /> With necks in thunder cloth'd, &amp;
						long-resounding pace. </p>
					<p>(Epode 3a.) </p>
					<p>Hark! his hands the Lyre explore. <lb /> Full-plume'd Fancy, hov'ring o'er <lb /> Scatters from her pictured Urn <lb /> Thoughts,
						that breath, &amp; Words, that burn: <lb /> But ah! 'tis heard no more&#x2014; <lb /> Oh Lyre divine, what daring Spirit <lb /> Wakes
						thee now? tho' he inherit <lb /> Nor the pride, nor ample pinion, <lb /> That the Theban Eagle bear <lb /> Sailing with supreme
						dominion <lb /> Thro' the azure deep of air: <lb /> Yet oft before his infant-eyes would run <lb /> Such Forms, as glitter in the
						Muse's ray <lb /> With orient hues, unborrow'd of the Sun. <lb /> Yet shall he mount, &amp; keep his distant way <lb /> Beyond the
						limits of a vulgar fate, <lb /> Beneath the Good how far! &#x2013; but far above the Great. </p>
				</q>
				<p>If this be as tedious to You, as it is grown to me, I shall be sorry that I sent it you. I do not pretend to <hi rend="italic"
						>debellate</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2074tm" /> any one's Pride: I love my own too well to attempt it. as to mortifying their Vanity it is too easy
					&amp; too mean a task for me to delight in. you are very good in shewing so much sensibility on my account. but be assured, my Taste
					for Praise is not like that of Children for fruit. if there were nothing but Medlars &amp; Blackberries in the world, I could be very
					well content to go without any at all. I dare say that M&#x2014;n (tho' some years younger than I,) was as little elevated with the
					approbation of Ld D: and Ld M:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2075tm" /> , as I am mortified by their silence. I desire you would by no means
					suffer this to be copied; nor even shew it, unless to very few, &amp; especially not to mere Scholars<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2076tm" />
					, that can scan all the measures in Pindar, &amp; say the Scholia by heart. the oftener, &amp; (in spite of poor Trollope<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2077tm" /> ) the <hi rend="italic">more</hi> you write to me, the happier I shall be. I envy your Opera. your
					Politicks I don't understand; but I think, matters can never continue long in the situation they now are. Barbarossa<anchor

						Arms<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2079tm" /> look'd askew upon me, than the Mitre; it is enough to be well-bred to both of them. You do not
					mention Ld Strathmore,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2080tm" /> so that I doubt, if you received my little Letter about him. Masn is still
					here: we are all mighty glad he is in Orders,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2081tm" /> &amp; no better than any of us. pray inform me, if Dr.
						Clerke<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2082tm" /> is come to Town, &amp; where he is fix'd, that I may write to him, angry as he is. my

				<p>According to my reckoning Mrs Wh: should have been brought to bed before this time; yet you say not a syllable of it. if you are so
					loth to publish <hi rend="italic">your productions,</hi> you can not wonder at the repugnance I feel to spreading abroad mine. but in

					<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2105tm" />
					<hi rend="italic">alone.</hi> I have two or three Ideas<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2106tm" /> more in my head. what is to come of them?
					must they too come out in the shape of little six-penny flams,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2107tm" /> dropping one after another, till Mr
					Dodsley thinks fit to collect them with Mr this's Song, and Mr t'other's epigram, into a pretty Volume? I am sure Mason must be

					Professions, have a bad effect upon the Mind. this it is my Duty, &amp; Interest to maintain; but I shall still be very ready to write
					a Satyr upon the Clergy, &amp; an Epode against Historiographers,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2108tm" /> whenever you are hard press'd;
					&amp; (if you flatter me) may throw in a few lines with somewhat handsome upon Magnesia alba, &amp; Alicant-Soap. as to Humanity you
					know my aversion to it; wch is barbarous &amp; inhuman, but I can not help it. God forgive me.</p>
				<p>I am not quite of your opinion with regard to Strophe &amp; Antistrophe.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2109tm" /> setting aside the
					difficulties, methinks it has little or no effect upon the ear, wch scarce perceives the regular return of Metres at so great a

					has several such Odes.</p>
				<p>Ld S:<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2110tm" /> is come, &amp; makes a tall genteel figure in our eyes. his Tutors<anchor

						Historian<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2112tm" /> shall hear of it. I am going to ask a favour of you, wch I have no better pretence for
					doing, than that I have long been used to give you trouble. it is, that you would go to the London Insurance Office in
						Birchin-Lane<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2113tm" /> for me, &amp; pay two Insurances, one of my House at Wansted<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2114tm" /> (Policy, No 9675.) the other of that in Cornhill<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2115tm" /> (No 23470.) from
					Lady-Day next to Lady-Day, 1756. the first is 20 Shillings; the 2d, 12 Shillgs: &amp; be pleased to inclose the two Receipts (stamp'd)
					in a Cover, and send them to me; the sooner the better, for I am always in a little apprehension during this season of
						Conflagrations.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2116tm" /> I know you will excuse me, &amp; therefore will make no excuses. I can not think of
					coming to town, till sometime in April myself.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2117tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I know, you have wrote a very obliging Letter [to Tuthill]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2118tm" /> but as I have not seen it, &amp; he is

				<p>Amongst the variety of rational entertainments that Travel affords to a thinking mind, I have always rankd with the principal that
					fund wch it presents of new Ideas, peculiarly proper to be thrown upon paper in order to form that wch we call a free Epistolary
						correspondence.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2120tm" /> An easy Communication of Sentiments neither obscurd by a cloud of reserve, wch is

				<p>Germany<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2122tm" /> is a country&#x2013;But why should I tell my Friend who has seen France who has seen Italy
					what kind of a country is Germany. And yet perhaps he will not dispise me for it. For tho France is remarkable for its savoir-vivre and
					Italy for its Virtù. Yet Germany is the reservoir of solid Litterature &amp; therefore not unworthy of the attention of a Person who
					unites all these qualifications in his own particular and may be calld without flattery a Microcosm of the talents both of his own
					Island &amp; the continent. But Hard very hard is my fate that I cannot give him any satisfactory account of the state of Germanic
					Learning Having only as yet had a single Interview with MynHerr Shite the Royal Librarian of this place. MynnHerr Shite is of a
					roundish squab figure and of a face corresponding, that is as his Body is cylindrical, his face is rather circular than Oval, He
					apparells himself generally in a decent grass-green Suit. With a fair full Peruke not too full to break upon the spherical form of his
					cheeks &amp; yet full enough to add a graceful squarness on each side of them. The Altitude of his square-toedshoe heels the breadth of
					his Milk and waterd Rollups<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2123tm" /> and the size of his amber-headed Cane are all truly symbolical not only
					of his own Genius but of that of all his Compatriots. When I say that Mynheer Shite is the only erudite person whom I have yet seen, I
					must be understood to mean in this place, for when I lately made a tour to Hamburg, I met with another tho of a different Sex, her name
					Madam Belcht. Her person I will not attempt to describe But will endeavor to give you a morceau of Her Conversation, for I was honord
					with it, She askd me who was the famous Poet that writ the Nitt toats. I replyd Doctr Yonge.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2124tm" /> She begd
					leave to drink his Health in a Glass of sweet wine adding that he was her favrite English Author. We toasted the Doctor. Upon wch
					having a mind to give my Parnassian Toast, I askd Madame Belch if she had ever read La Petite Elegie dans La Cœmeterie Rustique, C'est
					Beaucoup Jolie je vous Assure! (for I had said fort jolie very often before). Oui Monsr (replyd Madame Belch) Je lu, &amp; elle est
					bien Jolie &amp; Melancholique mais elle ne touche point La Cœur comme mes tres cheres Nitt toats.</p>
				<p>The Prudence you recommended to me at parting &amp; wch you yourself are so remarkable for I shall strictly observe &amp; therefore
					will say nothing of the Place I am in. Indeed I have nothing to say if I was not prudent, only that it is the noisiest Place I ever was
					in, &amp; that I want to get out of it, wch I hope is no treason. I have sent Lord John Cavendish<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2125tm" /> a
					list of the Noises &amp; their times of beginning wch will give you some Idea if he shews you the Letter.</p>
				<p>Oh Mr Gray! I bought at Hamburg such a piano Forte,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2126tm" /> and so cheap, it is a Harpsichord too of 2
					Unisons &amp; the Jacks serve as mutes (when the Piano Forte stop is playd) by the cleverest mechanism imaginable.<anchor

				<p>Pray Mr Gray write soon (how strangly is my stile changd since the beginning!) and tell me about Rousseau or any thing. It's great
					Charity, I do assure you; I would have writ to you before but Hamburg &amp; Reviews prevented me. Whitehead head is here with his two

				<p>I was just returned from my Hampshire expedition,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2146tm" /> &amp; going to enquire after your little family,
					&amp; how they had got over the measles, when I found a Letter from Stonhewer, in wch he says nothing on that head; whence I conclude
					they are out of danger, &amp; you free from anxiety about them.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2147tm" /> but he tells me, you expect me in
					town, for wch I am at a loss to account, having said nothing to that purpose, at least I am sure, nothing with that meaning. I said, I
					was to go to Twickenham,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2148tm" /> &amp; am now expecting a letter from Mr. W: to inform me, when he shall be
					there. my stay will be at farthest a week with him, &amp; at my return I shall let you know, &amp; if the season be better than it now
					is, enquire, if you continue inclined to visit Windsor &amp; its Environs. I wished for you often on the Southern Coast, where I have
						been,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2149tm" /> &amp; made much the same Tour, that Stonhewer did before me. take notice, that the Oaks grow
					quite down to the Beach, &amp; that the Sea forms a number of Bays little &amp; great, that appear glittering in the midst of thick
					Groves of them. add to this the Fleet (for I was at Portsmouth two days before it sail'd)<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2150tm" /> &amp; the
					number of Vessels always passing along, or sailing up Southampton-River (wch is the largest of these Bays I mention) and enters about
					10 mile into the Land, &amp; you will have a faint Idea of the <hi rend="italic">South.</hi> from Fareham to Southampton, where you are
					upon a level with the coast, you have a thousand such Peeps &amp; delightful Openings, but would you see the whole at once, you must
					get upon Ports-Down 5 Mile on this side Portsmouth. it is the top of a ridge, that forms a natural Terrass 3 Mile long, literally not
					three times broader than Windsor-Terrass with a gradual fall on both sides &amp; cover'd with a turf like New-Market. to the North
					opens Hampshire &amp; Berkshire cover'd with woods, &amp; interspersed with numerous Gentlemen's Houses &amp; Villages. to the South,
					Portsmouth, Gosport, &amp;c: just at your foot in appearance, the Fleet, the Sea winding, &amp; breaking in bays into the land, the
					deep shade of tall Oaks in the enclosures, wch become blue, as they go off to distance, Portchester-Castle, Carshot-Castle,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2151tm" /> &amp; all the Isle of Wight, in wch you plainly distinguish the fields, hedge-rows, &amp; woods next the
					shore, &amp; a back-ground of hills behind them. I have not seen a more magnificent or more varied Prospect. I have been also at
					Tichfield, at Netly-Abbey,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2152tm" /> (a most beautiful Ruin in as beautiful a situation) at Southampton, at
						Bevis-Mount,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2153tm" /> at Winchester, &amp;c: my Gout is gone, but I am not absolutely well yet. I hear Mason
					was expected on Monday last, but was not to speak of it, therefore you will say nothing till you see him. I do not understand this, nor
					what he means by coming. It seems wrong to me. what did you think of the <hi rend="italic">Morceau</hi>

				<p>I thank you for your intelligence about Herculaneum,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2172tm" /> which was the first news I received of it. I
					have since turned over Monsignor Baiardi's book,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2173tm" /> where I have learned how many grains of modern wheat
					the Roman Congius, in the Capitol, holds, and how many thousandth parts of an inch the Greek foot consisted of more (or less, for I
					forget which) than our own. He proves also by many affecting examples, that an Antiquary may be mistaken: That, for any thing any body
					knows, this place under ground might be some other place, and not Herculaneum; but nevertheless, that he can shew for certain, that it
					was this place and no other place; that it is hard to say which of the several Hercules's was the founder; therefore (in the third
					volume) he promises to give us the memoirs of them all; and after that, if we do not know what to think of the matter, he will tell us.
					There is a great deal of wit too, and satire and verses, in the book, which is intended chiefly for the information of the French King,
					who will be greatly edified without doubt.</p>
				<p>I am much obliged to you also for Voltaire's performance;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2174tm" /> it is very unequal, as he is apt to be in
					all but his dramas, and looks like the work of a man that will admire his retreat and his Leman-Lake no longer than till he finds an
					opportunity to leave it: However, though there be many parts which I do not like, yet it is in several places excellent, and every
					where above mediocrity. As you have the politeness to pretend impatience, and desire I would communicate, and all that, I annex a piece
					of the Prophecy;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2175tm" /> which must be true at least, as it was wrote so many hundred years after the
					events.</p>

				<p>Instead of going to Twickenham I was obliged to send my excuses,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2177tm" /> &amp; the same day Mr. W: sent a
					messenger to say he was confined in Town with a Fever &amp; a Rash.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2178tm" /> he has since wrote me word, that
					he is well again; but for me I continue much as I was, &amp; have been but once out of the house to walk, since I return'd from

					I sent for advice at last, &amp; expected Dr Hayes<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2179tm" /> should tell me presently, whether it were Gout or
					Rheumatism. in his talk he treated it rather as the former, but his prescription appears to me to be meant for the latter. you will
					judge. he took away 10 or 11 <hi rend="italic">Oz</hi> of blood, &amp; order'd these draughts night &amp; morning:&#x2013;<hi
						rend="italic">Sal: Absinth. Succ: Limon. finitâ effervescentiâ add: Aqu: Alexit. Simpl:, Menth: Piperit, Magnes. alb., Tinct: G.
						Guiac. Spirituos.</hi> the quantities I can't read; only I think there is a Dram of the Tincture, &amp; ½ a Dram of Magnesia in each
					draught. the Blood had no sign of inflammation, but of a bright red: the Serum of a dark yellow with little transparency, not viscid to
					the touch. the draughts (wch I took over night only) made me sweat almost immediately, &amp; open'd a little in the morning. the
					consequence is, that I have still many slight complaints. broken &amp; unrefreshing sleeps, as before. less feverish than I was, in a
					morning: instead of it a sensation of weariness and soreness in both feet, wch goes off in the day. a frequent dizziness &amp;
					lightness of head. easily fatigued with motion. sometimes a little pain in my breast, as I had in the winter. these symptoms are all
					too slight to make an illness; but they do not make perfect health. that is sure. </p>

					so strangely as they did four year ago, and are not frightful enough to make one Laugh.&#x2013;I was told yesterday by Lady H that it
					was her Birthday and she wondered I had not writ her some Verses. so I did, &amp; here they are.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2193tm" />
				</p>
				<q>
					<p>Had R&#x2013;d<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2194tm" /> bad my muse essay<lb /> To hail her, on her natal day <lb /> I soon had Ransackd
						Natures bowers <lb /> For Blushing fruit &amp; fragrant flowrs <lb /> And sworn till Fops believd it true <lb /> That all their
						sweetness all their hue <lb /> Were nought to what her cheekes advance <lb /> Adornd tout alamode de France </p>
					<p>Or had gay Lady C***<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2195tm" />
						<lb /> Been bent on such an odd design, <lb /> And deignd my verses to receive, <lb /> (For Verse is all I have to give) <lb /> It
						soon had been my tuneful prayr <lb /> To beg propitious Fate to spare <lb /> The Bliss she has, &amp; alway lend <lb /> An easy Lord
						and genrous friend. </p>
					<p>But how to suit my song to you <lb /> Is mighty hard, for entre nous <lb /> You're most unfashionably fair, <lb /> Content with your
						own face &amp; air, <lb /> And more unfashionably true, <lb /> A Husband bounds your utmost view. </p>
					<p>This then the Case, my Rhymes I'll close, <lb /> And wish in verse as plain as prose, <lb /> That Tunbridge from her springs may
						grant <lb /> The little added health you want; <lb /> And that for many a happy year <lb /> You need not to her fount repair, <lb />
						Unless to see as now you see <lb /> Each varied form of vanity, <lb /> And candid laugh, as now you do, <lb /> At all the fools her
						walks can shew. </p>
					<p>Yet one wish more &#x2013; May Fortune kind <lb /> Soon briskly blow a North-east wind;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2196tm" />
						<lb /> And then some few days past &amp; gone <lb /> Youll scarce pull Coifs for St Simon.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2197tm" />
					</p>
				</q>
				<p>You must observe this is not the St Simon mentioned in a Book you have formerly read calld the Testament, But another quite of a
					different family and whose name is pronounced Sĕnsĭmmong like a Dactyle.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2198tm" /> Well, how do you like my
					Verses? Whether shall I call them, To Lady H on her Birthday; or a Lampoon on Lady R &amp; Lady C? one talks of nothing but Lampoons
					here, pray unde derivatur Lampoon?<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2199tm" /> You have a pretty knack at an oldfashioned Welch Ode,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2200tm" /> but you are nothing like me at an Impromptu. If you write to me Direct to The young Man that my Aunt Dent
					had like to have ravishd. Axton<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2201tm" /> writ to me yesterday about his fellowship. twas rather a
					sesquipedalian Letter; however I answerd it today, &amp; hopd he would behave gratefully to Mr Brown who I sayd was much his friend,

					<salute>Dear Mr Gray </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>It is not true that I again make interest to be transported into Ireland;<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2222tm" /> and yet I beleive too it
					will be my fate. I am totally passive in the whole affair, and shall remain so, the only step I ever took, wch could be calld active,
					was to write a Letter to Mr Bonfoy,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2223tm" /> simply to enquire whether it was true that the Marquiss<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2224tm" /> intended to take me next; wch he has now answerd in the affirmative; but as Louth<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg1a.2225tm" /> is still to continue first Chaplain, the time when is uncertain, &amp; cannot be these two years, in wch
					space you know a Man may die or do a hundred pretty things. &#x2013; But I hear, since I came into these parts, that Seward the
						Critic<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2226tm" /> is very anxious about taking my Place, &amp; has made offers of making over to me a great
					living in the Peak,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2227tm" /> if he may go in my stead. Here too I preserve my Passivity. It being totally
					indifferent to me whether they thrust me into the Devil's A&#x2013;e,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2228tm" /> or an Irish Bog.</p>
				<p>Yet, tho I say I am indifferent to both these, I will in my present circumstances embrace either. The world has nothing to give me
					that I really care for, therefore Whatever she gives me, or however she gives it, does not matter a rush. And yet I own I would have
					some thing more of her too, merely because I have not Philosophy, or a better thing Œconomy, to make what I have a Competency.</p>
				<p>[ &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2229tm" /></p>
				<p>Whitehead has sent me some Verses from Vienna,<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2230tm" /> treating of my Indolence, &amp; other weighty
					matters, &amp; exhorting me not to detach myself too much from the World. The Verses are really very easy, &amp; natural, &amp; I would
					transcribe them for you if it was not too much trouble. &amp; yet you would not like them, if I did; because of some Words, wch I know
					would not digest upon your Stomach; neither do they on mine; for I dont know how it is, but the slops you have given me have made my
					Digestive facultys so weak, that several things of that sort, wch were once as easy to me as hasty pudding, never get thro the first
					concoction, &amp; lay as heavy in the prima Via as toasted Cheese. All wch I impute to your Nursery, where you would never let one eat
					any thing that was solid, as I did at St Johns.<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2231tm" />
				</p>
				<p>"Write (you say) something stately at Aston."<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2232tm" /> I writ nothing there but Sermons, &amp; those I only
					transcribd. Write yourself if you please, at least finish your Welch Ode<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2233tm" /> &amp; send it me to Hull,
					for there is an Alderman there, that I want to give his opinion about it.</p>
				<p>But pray Why Mr Gray! must I write &amp; you Not? Upon my word Sr! I really dont mean it as a flattery or any thing of that sort, no
					Sr I detest the insinuation. but, Blast my Laurells Sr if I dont think you write vastly better than I do. I swear by Apollo (my dear
					Sr) That I would give all my Elfrida<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2234tm" /> (Odes included) to be the Author of that pretty Elegy, that Miss
					Plumbtree can say off book. And I protest to you, that my Ode on Memory<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2235tm" /> after it has gone through all
					the Limæ Labor that our friend Horace prescribes, Nay Si prematur Nonum in Annum<anchor xml:id="id_tg1a.2236tm" /> (above half of wch
					time it has already I assure you been conceald Malgre my Partiality to it), I say that that very Ode is not, nor ever will be, half so
					terse, &amp; complete as the fragment of your Welch Ode; wch is as one may say now just warm from your Brain, &amp; one would expect as
					callow as a newhatchd Chicken (pardon the barndoor Simile) but all your productions are of a different sort, they come from you Armd
					Capapee at all points, as Minerva is said to have issued from the Head of Jupiter. I have thus said enough to shew you that however I
					may have laid aside the practical part of poetry I retain all that internal force, that Ignea vis, wch inspires evry true Son of
					parnassus with all wch I am fervently yours</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor</salute>
				</opener>
				<p> I am quite of Mr Alderman's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.5tm" /> opinion; provided you have a very fair prospect of success (for I do not
					love repulses, tho' I believe in such cases they are not attended with any disgrace) such an employment<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.6tm" />
					must necessarily give countenance &amp; name to one in your profession, not to mention the use it must be of in refreshing &amp;
					keeping alive the Ideas of Practise you have already got, &amp; improving them by new observation. it can not but lead to other
					business too in a more natural way, than perhaps any other; for whatever lucky chance may have introduced into the world here &amp;
					there a Physician of great vogue, the same chance may hardly befall another in an age; &amp; the indirect &amp; by-ways, that doubtless
					have succeeded with many, are rather too dirty for you to tread. as to the time it would take up, so much the better. whenever it
					interferes with more advantageous practise, it is in your power to quit it. in the mean time it will prepare you for that trouble &amp;
					constant attendance, wch much business requires a much greater degree of. for you are not to dream of being your own Master, till
					Old-age &amp; a satiety of gain shall set you free. I tell you my notions of the matter, as I see it at a distance, wch you, who stand
					nearer, may rectify at your pleasure.</p>
				<p>I have continued the Soap every other day from the time I left you, except an interval or two of a week or ten days at a time, wch I
					allow'd in order to satisfy myself, whether the good effects of it were lasting, or only temporary. I think, I may say it has
					absolutely cured that complaint I used to mention to you, &amp; (what is more) the ill-habit, wch perhaps was the cause of that, &amp;
					of the flying pains I have every now &amp; then felt in my joints. whenever I use it, it much increases my appetite, &amp; the
					Heart-burn is quite vanish'd. so I may venture to say, it does good to my Stomach. when I shall speak of its bad effects, you are no
					longer to treat me as a whimsical body, for I am certain now, that it disorders the head, &amp; much disturbs one's sleep. this I now
					avoid by taking it immediately before dinner; &amp; besides these things are trifles compared with the good it has done me. in short I
					am so well, it would be folly to take any other medecine: therefore I reserve Lime-water for some more pressing occasion. I should be
					glad to know the particulars of Ld Northumb:d<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.7tm" /> &amp; the Archbish:ps<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.8tm" />
					illnesses, &amp; how far it has eased them in the Gout.</p>
				<p>I am glad you admire Machiavel, &amp; are entertained with Buffon,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.9tm" /> &amp; edified with the Divine
						Ashton.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.10tm" /> the first (they say) was a good Man, as much as he has been abused; &amp; we will hope the
					best of the two latter. Mr. [Bedingfield],<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.11tm" /> who (as [ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.12tm" /> sent me word)
					desired to be acquainted with me, call'd here (before I came down) &amp; would pay a visit to my rooms. he made Dr Long<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.13tm" /> conduct him thither, left me a present of a Book<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.14tm" /> (not of his own writing)
					&amp; a Note with a very civil Compliment. I wrote to him<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.15tm" /> to thank him, &amp; have received an answer,
					that fifteeen years ago might have turn'd my head. I know [ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.16tm" /> will abuse him to you, but I insist he is
					a Slanderer, &amp; shall write a Satire upon him, if he does not do Justice to my new Admirer. I have not added a line more to old
						Caradoc;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.17tm" /> when I do, you will be sure to see it. you who give yourself the trouble to think of my
					health, will not think me very troublesome if I beg you to bespeak me a Rope-Ladder (for my Neighbours every day make a great progress
					in drunkenness, wch gives me reason to look about me) it must be full 36 Foot long, or a little more, but as light &amp; manageable as
					may be, easy to unroll, &amp; not likely to entangle. I never saw one, but I suppose it must have strong hooks, or something
					equivalent, a-top, to throw over an iron bar<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.18tm" /> to be fix'd withinside of my window. however you will
					chuse the properest form, &amp; instruct me in the use of it. I see an Ephraim Hadden near Hermitage Stairs Wapping,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.19tm" /> that advertises them, but perhaps you may find a better Artisan near you. this with a Canister of Tea &amp;
					another of Snuff, wch I left at your house, &amp; a Pound of Soap from Mr. Field<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.20tm" /> (for mine is not so
					good here) will fill a Box, wch I beg the favour of you to send [me],<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.21tm2" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.21tm1" /> when you can conveniently. my best Compliments to M[rs].<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.21tm" /> Wharton.</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>

				<p>Tho' I had no reasonable excuse for myself before I received your last letter, yet since that time I have had a pretty good one,
					having been taken up in quarrelling with Peter-house, &amp; in removing myself from thence to Pembroke.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.23tm" />
					this may be look'd upon as a sort of Æra<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.24tm" /> in a life so barren of events as mine, yet I shall treat it in
					Voltaire's manner,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.25tm" /> &amp; only tell you, that I left my lodgings, because the rooms were noisy, &amp;
					the People of the house dirty. this is all I would chuse to have said about it; but if you in private should be curious enough to enter
					into a particular detail of facts &amp; minute circumstances, Stonhewer who was witness to them will probably satisfy you. all, I shall
					say more, is, that I am for the present extremely well lodged here,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.26tm" /> &amp; as quiet as in the Grande
					Chartreuse; &amp; that every body (even the Dr Longs<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.27tm" /> &amp; Dr Mays<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.28tm" />) are
					as civil, as they could be to Mary de Valence<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.29tm" /> in person. with regard to any advice I can give as to the
						Hospital,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.30tm" /> I freely own it ought to give way to Dr. H:s<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.31tm" /> counsels, who
					is a much better judge, &amp; (I should think) disinterested. I love refusals no more than you do; but as to your Effluvia, I maintain,
					that one sick <hi rend="italic">rich</hi> has more of pestilence &amp; putrefaction about him, than a whole ward of sick Poor.</p>
				<p>You should have received Mason's present<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.32tm" /> as last Saturday.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.33tm" /> I desire
					you to tell me your critical opinion of the new Ode:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.34tm" /> &amp; also whether you have found out two lines,
					wch he has inserted in another of them, that are superlative.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.35tm" /> we do not expect, that the world, wch is
					just going to be <hi rend="italic">invaded,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.36tm" /> will bestow much attention on them. if you hear any thing, you will tell us.</p>
				<p>The similitude between the Italian Republicks &amp; those of ancient Greece has often struck me, as it does you. I do not wonder,
					that Sully's Memoirs<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.37tm" /> have highly entertain'd you. but can not agree with you in thinking him or his
					Master two of the <hi rend="italic">best Men</hi> in the world. the King<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.38tm" /> was indeed one of the
					best-natured Men, that ever lived. but it is owing only to chance, that his intended Marriage with Mad: d'Estrées, or with the Marq:se
					de Verneuil, did not involve him &amp; the kingdom in the most inextricable confusion; &amp; his design upon the Princess of
						Condé<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.39tm" /> (in his old age) was worse still. as to the Minister, his base application to Concini<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.40tm" /> after the murther of Henry has quite ruin'd him in my esteem,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.41tm" /> &amp; destroy'd
					all the merit of that honest surly Pride, for wch I honour'd him before. yet I own, that as Kings &amp; Ministers go, they were both
					extraordinary Men. pray look at the end of Birch's State Papers of Sr T: Edmonde's, for the Character of the French Court at that time,
					written by Sr George Carew.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.42tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Pray don't suspect me of any such <hi rend="italic">suspicions,</hi> as you mention. I would hardly believe you were tired of me,
					tho' you told me so yourself, sensible as I am nevertheless, that you might have reason enough to be so. to prove what I say, I have
					thoughts of coming to you for three days in April. there is to be a Concerto Spirituale, in wch the Mingotti<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.43tm" /> (who has just lain in) &amp; Ricciarelli will sing the <hi rend="italic">Stabat Mater</hi> of
						Pergolesi.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.44tm" /> You &amp; Mason &amp; I are to be at it together, so pray make no excuses, nor put-offs.
					saving to you however the liberty of saying whether you have a bed to spare (I mean for me, not for him) in your house.</p>

				<p> I do not doubt but before this time You have made many reflections on my caprice, or extreme unpoliteness, in giving no sign of
					gratitude, or even of bare sensibility, to your very obliging Letter. but I shall throw part of the fault on you, for only consider how
					embarassing it is, to receive the highest applause, (&amp; that given with an air of sincerity) without either exposing one's own pride
					quite naked, or affecting to cover it with an aukward humility, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> every body has eyes to see through. in short
					I hope You very accurately informed yourself of my age, before you ventured to treat me so, for had I been some years younger, it might
					have turn'd my head. as it is, I find myself still young enough to tast the sweets of praise (and to like the taste too) yet old enough
					not to be intoxicated with them. to own the truth, they give me spiritis, but I begin to wonder, they should hurt any body's health,
					when we can so easily dash them with the bitter salutary drop of misery &amp; mortality, that we always carry about us. I well remember
					the honour You did me in expressing so kind a prejudice &amp; partiality for one as yet unknown to you, as to offer him your
					Friendship. I own it is difficult to excuse my silence here, &amp; therefore I will trust this part of my cause to your humanity. begin
					to exercise your Good-Will to me by bearing with that natural gloom &amp; heaviness of temper, that hangs about me. when we are better
					acquainted, I fear you will meet with many more essential faults to exercise your indulgence upon.</p>
				<p> You must indulge me too in another instance of less importance. that Ode, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> has been mention'd to you<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.47tm" /> under the name of the <hi>Powers of Poetry</hi><anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.48tm" /> I should very readily shew
					you, whenever we meet, &amp; be glad to ask your opinion of it: but I can convey it to you no other way than by the Post, w<hi
						rend="super">ch</hi> is not to be depended upon, &amp; I have been already threaten'd with publication, tho' there are no more than
					three copies<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.49tm" /> of it in the world. to abate your curiosity I assure you it is very incorrect, &amp; being
					wrote by fits &amp; starts at very distant intervals is so unequal that it will hardly admit of particular corrections. You may believe
					me, for I pretend to judge of myself with tolerable impartiality. you call it <hi>celebrated</hi>, but its celebrity is only owing to
					its being yet unpublish'd. I have written part of another,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.50tm" /> w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> intends to be much
					better, but my Inspiration is very apt to fail me before I come to a conclusion. I desire to know your opinion of M<hi rend="super"
						>r</hi> Mason's four new Odes.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.51tm" /> you will see, that He is a particular Friend of mine, from reading
						them:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.52tm" /> yet I expect your judgement upon them &amp; that of your best Northern Criticks, if there be any
					Criticks there. provided You shew yourself noble &amp; forgive my long inactivity, I will repay your Criticism in Poetry, but it must
					be Latin, for I too wrote Latin once upon a time.</p>
				<p> My Compliments have now a sort of right to wait upon Lady Swinburne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.53tm" /> whose former politeness I well
					remember'd, &amp; whose invitation I should gladly embrace if I had the good fortune of seeing York again. there is another Lady<anchor

				<p> If all the Greek you transcribed<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.58tm" /> for me were Poetry already I would bestir myself to oblige you
					&amp; Mr Rivett,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.59tm" /> but as it is no more than measured Prose, &amp; as unfortunately (in English verse) a
					Tripod with two ears, or more, has no more dignity than a Chamber-pot with one, I do not see, why you would have me Dress it up with

					translation, as in the best numbers of Dryden. if you think otherwise, why don't you do it yourself, &amp; consult me, if you think
					fit. I rejoice to hear the Prints succeed so well, &amp; am impatient for the work, but do not approve the <hi rend="italic">fine

				<p>I feel a contrition for my long silence; &amp; yet perhaps it is the last thing you trouble your head about. nevertheless I will be
					as sorry, as if you took it ill. I am sorry too to see you so punctilious, as to stand upon answers, &amp; never to come near me, till
					I have regularly left my name at your door, like a Mercer's Wife, that imitates People, who go a-visiting. I would forgive you this, if
					you could possibly suspect I were doing any thing, that I liked better. for then your formality might look like being piqued at my
					negligence; wch has somewhat in it like kindness: but you know I am at Stoke, hearing, seeing, doing, absolutely nothing. not such a
					nothing, as you do at Tunbridge, chequer'd &amp; diversified with a succession of fleeting colours; but heavy, lifeless, without form,
					&amp; void; sometimes almost as black, as the <hi rend="italic">Moral</hi> of Voltaire's Lisbon,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.73tm" /> wch
					angers you so. I have had no more pores &amp; muscular inflations, &amp; am only troubled with this depression of mind. you will not
					expect therefore I should give you any account of my <hi rend="italic">Verve,</hi> wch is at best (you know) of so delicate a
					constitution, &amp; has such weak nerves, as not to stir out of its chamber above three days in a year. but I shall enquire after
					yours, &amp; why it is off again? it has certainly worse nerves than mine, if your Reviewers have frighted it. sure I (not to mention a

					Presbyterian Parsons,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.75tm" /> that ever were born. pray give me leave to ask you. do you find yourself tickled
					with the commendations of such People? (for you have your share of these too) I dare say not. Your Vanity has certainly a better taste.
					and can then the censure of such Criticks move you? I own, it is an impertinence in these Gentry to talk of one at all either in good
					or in bad, but this we must all swallow, I mean not only we, that write, but all the <hi rend="italic">we's</hi> that ever did any
					thing to be talk'd of. I canot pretend to be learned without books, nor to know the Druids from the Pelasgi<anchor

					view it has of Caernarvonshire, from wch it is separated by the Menai, a narrow arm of the Sea. forgive me for supposing in you such a

				<p>I congratulate you on our glorious successes in the Mediterranean. shall we go in time, &amp; hire a house together in

					vote for him. Mr Mason, who is himself qualified to be Master, &amp; might probably enough succeed, I am fully persuaded (tho' you will
					think there is not common Sense in the assertion) will do every thing to further Mr Brown's election. he (if you will let him know,
					when you are at home,) will wait upon you, &amp; give you any necessary information. I can answer for Mr Bs Principles in Government,

					be decided in 8 or 10 days, I believe, the obligation you will lay upon me by this, will be as great or greater than if I myself were
					the immediate object of your kindness. but I repeat, that You only are to judge, how far it can answer the end I propose. Mason comes
					to Town from Tunbridge today, &amp; will stay there, I imagine, some days.</p>

					<dateline>July 30. Friday. 1756. <lb /> Stoke </dateline>
					<salute>Dear Mason</salute>
				</opener>
				<p> I received your Letters both at once<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.97tm" /> yesterday which was Thursday, such is the irregularity of our
					Post. the affair of Southwell<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.98tm" /> at this time is exceedingly unlucky. if it is committed to you, by all
					means defer it. it is even worth while to stop Mrs Southwell,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.99tm" /> who will enter into the reason of it.
					another thing is, you have very honestly &amp; generously renounced your own interest (I mention it not as a compliment, but <hi
						rend="italic">pour la rareté du fait</hi>) to serve Mr B:; but what if you might serve him still better by seemingly making interest
					for yourself.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.100tm" /> Addison<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.101tm" /> must certainly be a Competitor. he will have
					the old (new) Ld Walpole of Wolterton, his Patron, to back him, the Bp of Chester, the Heads, who know him for a staunch Man, &amp;
					consequently the D: of N:. if you can divide or carry this interest, &amp; by it gain the dirty part of the College, so as to throw it
					into Mr B:s scale at pleasure, perhaps it may produce an unanimous election. this struck me last night as a practicable thing. but I
					see some danger in it. for you may disoblige your own friends, &amp; Ld H: must, I doubt, be acquainted with your true design, who very
					likely will not come into it. T:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.102tm" /> also &amp; Mr B: himself should be acquainted with it immediately.
					consider therefore well, whether this or the plain open way (wch, I own, is commonly the best) be most likely to succeed. the former,
					if it be found impracticable for Mr B: at last, may make it sure for yourself, wch is to be wish'd in the next place. it is odd to talk
					thus to a Man about himself, but I think, I know to whom I am talking. I have puzzled my head about a list of the College, &amp; can
					make out only these. pray, supply it for me. </p>

				<p>I should hope 9 of these,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.115tm" /> &amp; perhaps Mapletoft too, if Gaskarth pleases, might be got for Mr B:,
					but I can answer only for T: Bedford has always profess'd a friendship for Mr B:, but he is a queer man. his Patron is a Mr Buller of
						Cornwall<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.116tm" /> a Tory. Delaval, Gask:th, Milbourne &amp; Axton you may soon enquire into yourself. Spencer
					(if he is one) has promised Dr. Wharton.</p>
				<p>I write to Mr. W: (your Neighbour over the way)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.117tm" /> to desire him to speak to Mr. F:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.118tm" /> or the D: of B:d,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.119tm" /> if it may be of use; &amp; add, that if he will let you
					know, he is at home, you will come, &amp; give him any information necessary. whether this will signify I can't say, but I do not see
					any hurt it can do.</p>
				<p>I wish, like you, I were at Camb:; but to hurry down on this occasion would be worse, than useless, according to my conception. I am
					glad you think of going,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.120tm" /> if they approve it. Dr L:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.121tm" /> if he is not

					<salute>Dear Sr</salute>
				</opener>
				<p> I see &amp; feel the very natural unwillingness you must have to apply to those Persons<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.123tm" /> for any
					thing, that may imply a sort of obligation; &amp; I more strongly see &amp; feel the obligation I have to you for being so ready to
					conquer that reluctance on my account. I could not at this distance do otherwise than refer you to Mr M:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.124tm"
					 /> (who, I hope, has seen you) for particulars, wch he is better inform'd of than I am. I have heard since, that Dr L:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.125tm" /> is alive, &amp; thought to be out of danger; but he is a very old Man, &amp; tho' I am glad to see we may
					probably spare you this trouble for the present, I can only look upon it as defer'd for a time. Mr Bn<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.126tm" />
					so little knew of my intention, that the good Man has wrote to acquaint me of Dr L:s illness, &amp; (if I will qualify myself by taking
						orders,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.127tm" /> &amp; I know not what) offers me his utmost endeavours to serve me in the same way, &amp;
					make me <hi rend="italic">his Master.</hi> you will know before now from Mn,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.128tm" /> whether the Man be dead,
					or dying, or alive &amp; well at last. my zeal (indeed gratitude) to Mr B: only could have forced me to put you upon a disagreeable
					task, &amp; I shall be glad to hear, there is no farther occasion for doing any thing. if you find there is not, you will be so good to
					mention nothing of what has past, for I am aware too, that my desire to serve him may chance to do hurt; yet was unwilling to omitt any
					thing, that might possibly do good.</p>
				<p>I put the thing in the strongest light to you (being obliged to be concise) &amp; I don't wonder it appear'd somewhat desperate to
					your foresight. but in reality Mr B: has a pretty-strong natural interest among his own society, &amp; might possibly be chose without
					any <hi rend="italic">brigue</hi> at all, &amp; spite of opposition. only I would wish to bring it to a certainty. no body calls him
						Jac:te;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.129tm" /> I only mean, in case of disputes he might be call'd that, or something as absurd, for want of
					other abuse.</p>
				<p>I will go to Town on Friday to see poor Mr Ch:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.130tm" /> &amp; at your return hope to thank you at Strawby for
					your kindness. if I made you no excuse before, it was because I thought you might have forgot the occasion of it.</p>

				<p> Upon my return hither after an absence of about three weeks,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.132tm" /> I find a letter, &amp; a
						present<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.133tm" /> inclosed in it from you. I receive, &amp; shall wear it, with pleasure both as a mark of your
					kindness, &amp; as it is in itself excessively pretty: but yet I have some little scruples of conscience. I own, it feels to me like a
					robbery of M<hi rend="super">rs</hi> Bedingfield.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.134tm" /> the crime is chiefly yours, but I am the Receiver.
					you indeed may make your peace on easy terms, but what attonement can I make her?</p>
				<p> I accept too with pleasure the marks of approbation you bestow on my two fragments,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.135tm" /> but here I have
					still greater scruples. I will not enter into a discussion of them; but only tell you, that <hi>admiration</hi> is a word, that has no
					place between two people, that ever mean to come together. besides (believe me) there is but one thing in life, that deserves it, &amp;
					that is not Poetry. I leave it to time, &amp; to our nearer acquaintance to abate your fervour (tho' setting aside my present interest
					in it, I do think it is the best of faults) &amp; demand of you a little more severity, than I have hitherto experienced. here is the
					continuation of the British Ode,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.136tm" /> on w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> you may exercise it.</p>

					of composition. if Parts only &amp; Imagination &amp; Sensibility were required, one might (I doubt not) find them in that Sex full as

				<p>Poor Mr Chute has now had the Gout for these five days with such a degree of pain &amp; uneasiness, as he never felt before. whether
					to attribute it to Dr La Cour's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.158tm" /> forcing medecines, or to a little cold he got as soon as he came
					hither, I know not, but for above forty hours it seem'd past all human suffering, &amp; he lay screaming like a Man upon the rack. the
					torture was so great, that (against my judgement &amp; even his own) he was forced to have recourse to [an]<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.159tm" /> infusion of Poppy-heads, wch Cocchi<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.160tm3" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.160tm2" /> used to give him, &amp; in [half]<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.160tm1" /> an hours time was easy, fell
					into a gentle perspiration, [&amp;]<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.160tm" /> slept many hours. this was the night before last, &amp; all
					yesterday he continued chearful &amp; in spirits. at night (as he expected) the pain returned, not so violent, but in more places, for
					now it is in one foot, both knees, &amp; one hand, and I hourly dread it will increase again to its former rage. if any thing sudden
					happen, who can I send to? here is no assistance nearer than a Dr Langrish<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.161tm" /> at Winchester, of whom he
					has no great opinion. as to Lacour he is enraged against him, &amp; looks upon him as the cause of all he suffers. I can not think
					there is any danger, for tho' with all this he is at times in a high Fever, yet it seems to depend upon the Gout entirely, increasing
					&amp; abating with the pain. but if anything unexpected happen, here are no body but myself &amp; Muntz<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.162tm"
					 /> in the house, would you advise to send to Mrs Pawlet,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.163tm" /> or to whom? you will oblige me, if you will
					answer me in a loose paper, for he must see your Letter. it will be a charity too to insert any thing of news, or whatever you please
					to tell us, for when he gets any respite from pain, he is capable &amp; desirous of entertainment, &amp; talks with an eagerness of
					spirits, that seems to make part of his distemper. pray tell us how Mr Man<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.164tm" /> does.</p>

				<p>I have the pleasure to tell you that after repeating once again his infusion of Poppies, wch caused each time an entire cessation
					from pain, &amp; an easy perspiration for near 24 hours, Mr Chute has had no return of his tortures, but for these four days has
					continued in a very tolerable state, chearful enough &amp; in good spirits in the day-time, his appetite beginning to return, &amp; all
					last night pass'd in quiet &amp; natural sleep. but he is (as you may imagine) still nail'd to his bed, &amp; much weaken'd. God knows,
					when he will be able to get up, or bear any motion, &amp; the least cold, as Autumn is coming on, will certainly bring it all back
					again. I am quite of your opinion about going to Town, as soon as it is possible; &amp; had of my own accord talk'd about it, but he
					seems rather set against it: however I hope to prevail. as to the Tracies,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.169tm" /> I think he told me just
					before this illness, that they were all coming, &amp; he had wrote to hinder it on some pretence or other. what you say about Mrs
						P:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.170tm" /> is very true. I only mention'd her, because she was more within reach than any body else: but I
					have now no farther thought of danger.</p>

				<p>Mr. Chute's proceedings are, as follows. soon after I wrote to you, being very easy, he got up &amp; sate in a chair for two days,
					where having caught cold, he proceeded to go to bed again. however as he has felt no great matter of pain, today he is to be seen once
					more sitting by the fire-side. he won't hear of London, but talks of Bath, so I am easy about it, as that seems full as well. yet I
					wish, he would hasten his journey. I think of returning in four or five days to Stoke, as he is now no longer alone in the house. we
					are much obliged to you for your Packets &amp; Newses, particularly for your old News. I, who deal in sequels &amp; second Parts, am
					anxious to know, what became of my Lady Sundon.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.175tm" /> whether she sunk into the ground, or flew thro' the
					window after this thunderclap.</p>

				<p>If you continue your intention of coming hither, Mr Chute desires, you would give yourself the trouble of looking among your prints
					(of Hollar<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.178tm" /> or others) for an inside-view of St George's Chappel at Windsor, &amp; be so good to bring
					it with you. I have a notion, there is such a Print in Ashmole's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.179tm" /> Book of the Garter.</p>
				<p>We have been up a second time for two days in our Chair, but are forced to lie in bed again today with the Gout in one ancle, yet

				<p>I have not been dead, but only gone to [Mr Chute who had been]<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.181tm" /> seized with a cruel fit of the Gout,
					wch held him five weeks, &amp; as he had no other company in the house it was impossible to leave him in that condition. since my

				<p>I grow impatient to be in Town, &amp; hope for the pleasure of seeing you on Tuesday next.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.205tm" /> I must
					confess, the present revolution of affairs,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.206tm" /> wch are settling so slowly, is some spur to my curiosity,
					tho' my own interests have no more concern in it, than those of any Cottager in the nation. I flatter myself, that necessity will at
					last throw the management of affairs into more capable, if not more honest hands, than usual. my Gazette<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.207tm"
					 /> says, that Mr. P:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.208tm" /> will be Sec: of State, &amp; has accepted it (tho' ill of the Gout in the
					Country) that the D: of Devonshire<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.209tm" /> has consented (wch was one of the conditions of acceptance) to be
					at the head of the Treasury. Ld Temple<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.210tm" /> of the Admiralty. G: Grenville,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.211tm"
					 /> Paymaster. Mr Legge<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.212tm" /> Chanc:r of the Exchequer. Sr G: Lee<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.213tm" /> Sec: at
					War. Mr. F:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.214tm" /> nothing. how far all this is fact, you know by this time. I do not forget your letter,
					when I say this, &amp; to whom it was wrote; but I much doubt, whether you would have received more benefit from his good-offices,
					while he continued in, than now he is in effect out.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.215tm" /> I am concerned too for another person,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.216tm" /> who surely can never continue, where he is (if he should, it is a wonderful proof of the force of
					insignificancy) &amp; if he does not, a good Friend<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.217tm" /> of ours must feel it a little in a part very
					tender to most people, his hopes; but he very wisely has been arming it for some time, I believe, with a reasonable insensibility,
					&amp; taking, by way of precaution a dose of my sovereign anodyne Fastidium.</p>
				<p>Don't fancy to yourself, that I have been doing any thing here. I am as stupid as a Post, &amp; have not added a syllable,<anchor

				<p> I will beg the favour of your Milton<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.258tm" /> once more. I have considerd your Observations<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.259tm" /> in the Paper you oblig'd me with yesterday. I think them excellent and shall correct accordingly.</p>
				<p> The only one of the least consequence that sticks with me is your hint about the Introduction. And I owe it to your frankness, to
					tell you my sincere sentiments. I hate the hypocrisy of those men who think to cover their own dullness under the mask of piety, as
					much as you can do. I know too what is to be said for those who have not devoted themselves to a Profession And still further for those
					who read the Poets, not for amusement only, but to contend with the best of them. I honour, in a word, true poetry and true Poets as
					much as any body. And I think, in particular, with you that M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Pope's apologies for himself were very needless.
					Yet still in my own case I must profess to you with sincerity, that what I say in the Letter is my real opinion.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.260tm" /> The Profession, I am of, is a sacred one. And tho' it does not oblige me to renounce the poets, my business,
					I think, should lie elsewhere. I assure you, I take this design to be but a decent one in my circumstances, and, considering the
					circumstances of the time, an absolute Duty. So that when these things are out of my hands, and the few Dialogues I mention'd to you, I
					have determin'd long since to pass the remainder of my Life (I mean if in that remainder I do any thing as a writer) in the concerns of
					my own Profession. However there are some things in the Introduction put more strongly than they needed to have been, and these I shall
					soften; principally because what I leave will then be understood, not as words of course, but as my real meaning.</p>
				<p> You will think I treat you very formally, in entering into this serious explanation. I do it to show you on what grounds, and with
					what reluctance, I deny myself the use of any part of your kind Intimations to me.</p>

				<p> I too am set down here with something greater hopes of quiet, than I could entertain, when I saw you last. at least nothing new has
					happen'd to give me any disturbance, &amp; the assurances, you gave me in your letter from hence,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.290tm" /> are

					chuses to part with, at any price he pleases, even with his want of sleep &amp; weak Bowels into the bargain. and I will be your
					Curate, &amp; he shall live here with all my wit, &amp; a power of learning. Dr Brown's book<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.292tm" /> (I hear)
					is much admired in Town, wch I do not understand. I expected it should be admired here; but they affect not to like it, tho' I know
					they ought. what would you have me do? there is one thing in it I applaud, wch is the dissertation against Trade, for I have always
					said, it was the ruin of the Nation. I have read the little wicked book about Evil,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.293tm" /> that settled Mr
					Dodsley's conscience in that point, &amp; find nothing in it, but absurdity. we call it Soame Jennyns's, but I have a notion you
					mention'd some other name to me, tho' I have forgot it. St: has done me the honour to send me your friend Ld Newnham<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.294tm" /> hither with a fine recommendatory letter (written by his own desire) in Newmarket-week.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.295tm" /> do not think he was going to New-Market. no! he came in a Solitaire,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.296tm" /> great
					Sleeves, jessamine-powder, &amp; a large Bouquet of Jonquils within twelve miles of that place on purpose not to go thither. we had
					three days intercourse, talk'd about the Beaux-Arts, &amp; Rome, &amp; Hanover &amp; Mason, whose praises we celebrated <hi
						rend="italic">a qui mieux mieux,</hi> vowed eternal friendship, embraced, &amp; parted. I promised to write you a thousand compliments
					in his name. I saw also Ld Villiers<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.297tm" /> &amp; Mr Spencer,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.298tm" /> who carried him
					back with them, <hi rend="italic">en passant.</hi> they did not like me at all. here has been too the best of all Johns<anchor

					no body else was present. Mr Franklyn<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.303tm" /> is not his Tutor. these are the most remarkable events at

				<p>Mr B:y<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.304tm" /> has been here. he had not done what you recommended to him, before he came out of Town, &amp;

					of the 5th Stanza are new.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.322tm" /> tell me, if they will do.</p>
				<p>I have seen your friend, the Dean of S:y,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.323tm" /> here to-day in the Theatre,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.324tm"

					lice, but with a painful infirmity, that has to me the charms of novelty, but would not amuse you much in the description. </p>
				<p>I hope you divert yourself much better, than I do. you may be sure, Dodsley had orders to send you some Odes,<anchor

					they will come to Sheffield in the shape of a small parcel by some coach or waggon: but if there is time, I will prevent it. they had
					been out three weeks ago, but Mr W:, having taken it into his head to set up a Press of his own at Twickenham, was so earnest to
					handsel it with this new pamphlet, that it was impossible to find a pretence for refusing such a trifle. you will dislike this, as much
					as I do, but there is no help. you understand, it is he, that prints them not for me, but for Dodsley.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.378tm" />
					I charge you send me some Caractacus,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.379tm" /> before I die. it is impossible, this weather should not bring

				<p>I am extremely sorry to hear of poor Mr Bentley's illness. what I can not account for is, that You or He should trust such a Dog of
					an Apothecary, after he had shew'd himself, to do any thing, even to sell medecines; when it is just as easy for him to put in a grain
					of slow poison, as to administer a dose of pure &amp; innocent brown-Paper. </p>
				<p>Dodsley sent me some copies<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.381tm" /> last week: they are very pleasant to the eye, &amp; will do no dishonour
					to your Press. as you are but young in the trade, you will excuse me if I tell you, that some little inaccuracies have escaped your

					if you do not commit greater faults in your next work, I shall grow jealous of Hentzerus.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.384tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I am going to add to the trouble I have given you by desiring you would tell me, what you hear any body say, (I mean, if any body

				<p> I give you many thanks for the favour of your Odes, which I have received after a tedious expectation. You may be sure the
					title-page amused us a good deal, but M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Brown has explained it.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.400tm" /> It is not worth
					while to tell you how they are received here. But every body would be thought to admire. 'Tis true, I believe, the greater part don't
					understand them.</p>
				<p> I have been amusing myself in my way, since you left us. The Letter to Mason<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.401tm" /> is printed off, and I
					shall send you a copy very soon to Dodsley's. The dialogues<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.402tm" /> too are all finished after a sort; so that
					I shall have work enough for you against our next meeting in November. I should be better pleased if you would find work for me. And I
					hope you don't forget, among your other amusements this summer, your design for a history of the English poetry. You might be
					regulating your plan, and digesting the materials you have by you.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.403tm" /> I shall teaze you perpetually, till
					you set about the project in good earnest. It is a wonderful favourite with me, and will, I am certain, in your hands be a work of much
					use as well as elegance.</p>
				<p> Mason has never once writ in all this time, which I take prodigiously ill, and desire you will tell him so. D<hi rend="super">r</hi>
					Warburton sends me word too, he did not keep his appointment with him of going to Durham. So that I can only conclude he is laid up of
					a fit of the Muse, or perhaps is gone to pay a visit to his Druids at Mona.</p>
				<p> If you give me the pleasure of hearing from you, you must write very soon. For I grow sick of this place, and set out on the 29<hi
						rend="super">th</hi> on my summer rambles. It will be a satisfaction to hear that you are well. I am sollicitous for nothing else. For
					you can never want the best sort of amusements. Once more, let me thank you for the Odes, which I like the better upon every reading.
						M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Nevile<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.404tm" /> too desires me to make his acknowledgments in full form. He is
					mightily flatter'd with the Present you was so kind to make him.</p>

					unfashionable thing, for all people of condition are agreed not to admire, nor even to understand: one very great man,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.413tm" /> writing to an acquaintance of his and mine, says that he had read them seven or eight times, and that now,
					when he next sees him, he shall not have above thirty questions to ask. Another, a peer,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.414tm" /> believes that
					the last stanza of the Second Ode relates to King Charles the First and Oliver Cromwell. Even my friends tell me they do not succeed,
					and write me moving topics of consolation on that head; in short, I have heard of nobody but a player<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.415tm" />
					and a doctor of divinity<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.416tm" /> that profess their esteem for them. Oh yes! a lady of quality,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.417tm" /> a friend of Mason's, who is a great reader. She knew there was a compliment to Dryden, but never suspected
					there was anything said about Shakspeare or Milton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.418tm" /> till it was explained to her; and wishes that
					there had been titles prefixed to tell what they were about.</p>
				<p>From this mention of Mason's name you may think, perhaps, we are great correspondents; no such thing; I have not heard from him these
					two months. I will be sure to scold in my own name as well as in yours. I rejoice to hear you are so ripe for the press, and so
						voluminous,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.419tm" /> &#x2013;not for my own sake only, whom you flatter with the hopes of seeing your labours
					both public and private, &#x2013; but for yours too, for to be employed is to be happy.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.420tm" /> This principle
					of mine, and I am convinced of its truth, has, as usual, no influence on my practice. I am alone and <hi rend="italic">ennuyé</hi> to
					the last degree, yet do nothing; indeed I have one excuse; my health, which you so kindly enquire after, is not extraordinary, ever
					since I came hither. It is no great malady, but several little ones, that seem brewing no good to me.</p>
				<p>It will be a particular pleasure to me to hear whether Content dwells in Leicestershire,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.421tm" /> and how she
					entertains herself there; only do not be too happy, nor forget entirely the quiet ugliness of Cambridge.</p>

				<p> I write this to be conveyed to you by M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason. We were together, when your favour of the 25<hi rend="super"
						>th</hi><anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.423tm" /> arrived, and laughed very heartily at the judgments of your great men and great women. Poor
					people, it is not for them to understand what you write. But without understanding, they will learn to admire, of their Betters. Every
					body here, that knows anything of such things, applauds the Odes. And the readers of Pindar dote upon them.</p>
				<p> I am truly concerned for what you tell me of your indisposition. You must abstain from books for the present, and use all the
					exercise you can. I should fancy, if you took a Post-chaise and went to dine with Mason at Kensington,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.424tm" />
					it would be a relief to you. His Caractacus mends daily, and will come to good in the end, in spite of Lords and Ladies, who will not
					like it.</p>
				<p> I set forward on my journey tomorrow. If I find a day of leisure, or rather of <hi>ennui</hi>, I may attempt to enliven it by
					writing to you again. In the mean time take care of your health and believe me,</p>

				<p> I am greatly obliged to your care &amp; kindness for considering with more attention, than it deserves, the article of my
						health.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.448tm" /> at present I am far better, &amp; take long walks again, have better spirits, &amp; am more

					for variety, &amp; because it will answer another end by furnishing me with a reason for not going into the country to <hi
						rend="italic">a place, where I am invited.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.449tm" /> (I think, you understand me) but the truth is, I can not afford to hurry about from place to place;
					so I shall continue, where I am, &amp; trust to <hi rend="italic">illness,</hi> or some other cause for an excuse, since to <hi

					I can not, &amp; something must be said. these are cruel things!</p>
				<p>The family<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.450tm" /> you mention near me are full as civil as ever; Miss Sp: seems to understand; &amp; to all

				<p>The Encyclopedie,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.462tm" /> I own, may cloy one, if one sets down to it. but you will own, that out of one

					<dateline>Sept: 28. 1757. Stoke. </dateline>
					<salute>Dear Mason</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I have (as I desired St:r to tell you) read over Caractacus twice not with pleasure only, but with emotion.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.468tm" /> you may say what you will, but the contrivance, the manners, the interests, the passions, &amp; the
					expression, go beyond the dramatic part<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.469tm" /> of your Elfrida many many leagues. I even say (tho' you will
					think me a bad judge of this) that the <hi rend="italic">World</hi> will like it better. I am struck with the Chorus, who are not there
					merely to sing &amp; dance, but bear throughout a principal part in the action, &amp; have, (beside the <hi rend="italic">Costume,</hi>
					wch is excellent) as much a character of their own, as any other Person. I am charmed with their priestly pride &amp; obstinacy, when
					after all is lost, they resolve to confront the Roman General, &amp; spit in his face: but now I am going to tell you, what touches me
					most, from the beginning. the first opening is greatly improved: the curiosity of Didius<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.470tm" /> is now a very
					natural reason for dwelling on each particular of the scene before him, nor is the description at all too long. I am glad to find the
					two young Men<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.471tm" /> are Cartismandua's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.472tm" /> Sons. they interest me far more. I
					love People of Condition. they were Men before, that no body knew: one could not make them a bow, if one had met them at a publick
					place.</p>
				<p>I always admired that interruption of the Druids to Evelina,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.473tm" />
					<hi rend="italic">Peace, Virgin, peace</hi> &amp;c: &amp; chiefly the <hi rend="italic">abstract Idea personified</hi> (to use the
					words of a Critick) at the end of it. that of Caractacus <hi rend="italic">would save my Queen,</hi> &amp;c: &amp; still more that, <hi
						rend="italic">I know it reverend Fathers, 'tis Heav'ns high will</hi> &amp;c: to <hi rend="italic">I've done. begin the rites!</hi>
					this latter is exemplary for the expression (always the great point with me) I do not mean by expression the mere choice of words, but
					the whole dress, fashion, &amp; arrangement of a thought. here in particular, it is the brokenness, the ungrammatical position, the
					total subversion of the period, that charms me. all that ushers in the Incantation from <hi rend="italic">Try we yet, what holiness can
						do</hi> I am delighted with in quite another way, for this is pure poetry, as it ought to be, forming the proper transition, &amp;
					leading on the mind to that still purer poetry, that follows it. You have somehow mistaken my meaning about the <hi rend="italic">sober
						Sisters</hi>: the verb <hi rend="italic">nod</hi> before only seem'd to be a verb neuter; now you have made it absolutely such, wch
					was just my objection to it. but it is easily alter'd, for if the accusative case come first, there is no danger of ambiguity. I
					read</p>
				<q>
					<p>See! their gold &amp; ebon rod <lb /> Where the sober Sisters nod, <lb /> And greet in whispers sage &amp; slow. <lb /> Snowden
						mark! 'tis Magick's hour; <lb /> Now the mutter'd spell hath power, <lb /> Power to rift thy ribs of rock, <lb /> To burst thy base
						with thunder's shock, <lb /> But &amp;c: &amp;c: <lb /> &#x2014;&#x2014; than those, that dwell <lb /> In Musick's &amp;c: </p>
				</q>
				<p>you will laugh at my <hi rend="italic">to</hi>ses &amp; <hi rend="italic">those</hi>s, but they strike my ear better. what Mador
					sings, must be the finest thing, that ever was wrote; &amp; the next Chorus, where they all go to sleep, must be finer still.</p>
				<p>In the beginning of the succeeding Act, I admire the Chorus again, <hi rend="italic">Is it not now the hour, the holy hour,</hi>
					&amp;c: &amp; their evasion of a lie, Sayst thou, proud Boy, &amp;c: &amp; <hi rend="italic">sleep with the unsun'd silver,</hi> wch is
					an example of a <hi rend="italic">dramatic</hi> Simile. the sudden appearance of Caractacus, the pretended respect &amp; admiration of
					Vellinus, &amp; the probability of his story, the distrust of the Druids, &amp; their reasoning with Caractacus, &amp; particularly
					that, <hi rend="italic">'Tis meet thou should'st, thou art a King,</hi> &amp;c: &amp; <hi rend="italic">Mark me, Prince, the time will
						come, when Destiny,</hi> &amp;c: are well, &amp; happily imagined. a-propos of the last striking passage I have mention'd, I am going
					to make a digression.</p>
				<p>When we treat a subject, where the manners are almost lost in antiquity, our stock of Ideas must needs be small, &amp; nothing
					betrays our poverty more, than the returning to, &amp; harping frequently on one Image. it was therefore I thought you should omitt
					some lines before, tho' good in themselves, about <hi rend="italic">the scythed Carr,</hi> that the passage now before us might appear
					with greater lustre, when it came; and in this I see, you have complied with me. but there are other Ideas here &amp; there still, that
					occur too often, particularly about <hi rend="italic">the Oaks,</hi> some of wch I would discard to make way for the rest.</p>
				<p>But the subjects I speak off to compensate (&amp; more than compensate) that unavoidable poverty, have one great advantage when they
					fall into good hands. they leave an unbounded liberty to pure imagination, &amp; fiction (our favourite provinces) where no Critick can
					molest, or Antiquary gainsay us. &amp; yet (to please me) these fictions must have some affinity, some seeming connection with that
					little we really know of the character &amp; customs of the People. for example I never heard in my days, that Midnight &amp; the Moon
					were Sisters, that they carried rods of ebony &amp; gold, or met to whisper on the top of a mountain: but now I could lay my life, it
					is all true; &amp; do not doubt, it will be found so in some Pantheon of the Druids, that is to be discover'd in the Library at
					Herculaneum. the <hi rend="italic">Car of Destiny &amp; Death</hi> is a very noble invention of the same class, &amp; as far as that
					goes, is so fine, that it makes me more delicate, than perhaps I should be, about the close of it. <hi rend="italic">Andraste sailing
						on the wings of Fame,</hi> that snatches the wreaths from Oblivion to hang them on her loftiest Amaranth, tho' a clear and beautiful
					piece of <hi rend="italic">unknown</hi> Mythology, has too <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> an air to give me perfect satisfaction.</p>
				<p>Now I proceed. the preparation to the Chorus, tho' so much akin to that in the former act, is excellent. the remarks of Evelina &amp;
					her suspicions of the Brothers, mix'd with a secret inclination to ye younger of them (tho', I think, her part throughout wants
					retouching) yet please me much. and the contrivance of the following scene much more. <hi rend="italic">Masters of Wisdom, no,</hi>
					&amp;c: I always admired; as I do the rocking stone, &amp; the distress of Elidurus. Evelina's examination of him is a well-invented
					scene, &amp; will be with a little pains a very touching one: but the introduction of Arviragus<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.474tm" /> is
					superlative. I am not sure, whether those few lines of his short narrative, <hi rend="italic">My strength repair'd, it boots not, that
						I tell,</hi> &amp;c: do not please me as much, as any thing in the whole Drama. the sullen bravery of Elidurus, the menaces of the
					Chorus, that <hi rend="italic">Think not,</hi> Religion<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.475tm" /> &amp;c: the Trumpet of the Druids; that <hi
						rend="italic">I'll follow him, tho' in my chains</hi> &amp;c:; <hi rend="italic">Hast thou a Brother, no</hi> &amp;c: the placability
					of the Chorus, when they see the motives of Elidurus' obstinacy, give me great contentment. so do the reflections of the Druid on the
					necessity of lustration, &amp; the reasons for Vellinus' easy escape. but I would not have him <hi rend="italic">seize on a spear,</hi>
					nor <hi rend="italic">issue hasty thro' the</hi> Cavern's mouth.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.476tm2" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.476tm1" /> why should he not steal away, unmark'd &amp; unmiss'd, till the hurry of passions in those, that
					should have guarded him, was a little abated? but I chiefly admire the two speeches of Elidurus, Ah Vellinus, is this then &amp;c: and,
						<hi rend="italic">Ye do gaze on me,</hi> Fathers!<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.476tm" /> &amp;c: the manner, in wch the Chorus reply to him,
					is very fine, but the image at the end wants a little mending. the next scene is highly moving! it is so very good, that I must have it
					made yet better.</p>
				<p>Now for the last Act. I do not know, what you would have, but to me the design &amp; contrivance of it is at least equal to any part
					of the Whole. the short-lived triumph of the Britons, the address of Caractacus to the Roman Victims, Evelina's discovery of the
					ambush, the mistake of the Roman fires for the rising Sun, the death of Arviragus, the interview between Didius, &amp; Caractacus, his
					mourning over his dead Son, his parting speech (in wch you have made all the use of Tacitus, that your Plan would admitt) every thing
					in short, but that little dispute between Didius &amp; him. <hi rend="italic">'Tis well. &amp; therefore to encrease that
						reverence</hi> &amp;c: down to, <hi rend="italic">Give me a moment</hi> (wch must be omitted, or put in the mouth of the Druids) I
					approve in the highest degree. if I should find any fault with the last act, it could only be with trifles &amp; little expressions. if
					you make any alteration, I fear, it will never improve it, I mean, as to the Plan. I send you back the two last sheets, because you bid
					me. I reserve my nibblings and <hi rend="italic">minutiæ</hi> for another day.</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I heartily rejoice with you, that your little family are out of danger, &amp; all apprehensions of that kind over with them for
						life.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.483tm" /> yet I have heard, you were ill yourself, &amp; kept your bed: as this was (I imagine) only by
					way of regimen, &amp; not from necessity; I hope soon to be told, you have no farther occasion for it. yet take care of yourself, for
					there is a bad fever now very frequent. it is among the boys at Eton, &amp; (I am told), is much spread about London too. my notion is,
					that your violent quick pulse, &amp; soapy diet would not suit well with feverish disorders. tho' our party at Slough turn'd out so
					ill, I could not help being sorry, that you were not with us.</p>
				<p>Have you read Mr. Hurd's (printed) Letter to Mason on the Marks of Imitation?<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.484tm" /> you do not tell me
					your opinion of it. you bid me send you criticisms on myself, &amp; even <hi rend="italic">compliments.</hi> did I tell you, what the
						Speaker<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.485tm" /> says? the 2d Ode, he says, is a good pretty tale, but nothing to the <hi rend="italic"
						>Churchyard.</hi> Mr. Bedingfield in a golden shower of panegyrick writes me word, that at Yorkraces he overheard three People, whom
					by their dress &amp; manner he takes for Lords, say, that I was impenetrable &amp; inexplicable, and they wish'd, I had told them in
					prose, what I meant in verse, &amp; then they bought me (wch was what most displeased him) &amp; put me in their pocket.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.486tm" /> Dr Warburton is come to Town, &amp; likes them extremely.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.487tm" /> he says the World
					never pass'd so just an opinion upon any thing as upon them: for that in other things they have affected to like or dislike, whereas
					here they own, they do not understand, wch he looks upon to be very true; but yet thinks, they understand them as well as they do
					Milton or Shakespear, whom they are obliged by fashion to admire. Mr G:k's compliment<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.488tm" /> you have seen; I
					am told it was printed in the Chronicle of last Saturday.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.489tm" /> the Review I have read, &amp; admire it,
					particularly that observation, that the <hi rend="italic">Bard</hi> is taken from <hi rend="italic">Pastor, cum traheret,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.490tm" /> &amp; the advice to be more an <hi rend="italic">original,</hi> &amp; in order to be so, the way is
					(he says) to cultivate the native flowers of the soil, &amp; not introduce the exoticks of another climate.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.491tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I am greatly pleased with M:n s Caractacus in its present state. the contrivance &amp; arrangement of events, the manners of the
					country, the characters &amp; passions, strike me wonderfully. the difficult part is now got over, nothing remains but to polish, &amp;
					retouch a little: yet only the beginning of the first Chorus is done of the lyric part. have you seen it? </p>

				<p>It will be three weeks or more before I can come to Town. I have had, almost eversince I was here, a much worse state of health than
					I have been used to, &amp; particularly of late: they advise me to force a fit of the Gout, but methinks it is better to bear with a

				<p>I should be extremely sorry to think that You or Mrs Wharton came a day the sooner to Town<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.508tm" /> on my
					account this fine season. if you are already come, I shall come to you: if not, you will let me know some day this week (for I shall

					very hard press'd) many things will appear, as well with regard to the design as the execution, that do not yet seem to be generally
					known. the design, for wch the Soldiers were put into the boats, was to attack a Fort, call'd <hi rend="italic">Fourasse,</hi> at the
					mouth of the Charante (for Rochefort itself lies five miles up the River).<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.510tm" /> it was necessary, they
					should be masters of this place not only to clear their way to the Town, but to have some place of security for their first imbarkation
					of about 1200 Men, who must remain for four hours exposed to the Enemy, before any reinforcement could join them (as the Admirals
					declared), &amp; (I have heard) this design was laid aside in great measure upon Capt: Howe's saying it would be, if practicable at
					all, a very bloody, &amp; difficult attempt. if therefore he asserts what you have been told, it is very strange. when I see you, I
					shall tell you more; &amp; even this, if you do not hear it publickly said, I should wish, you would not mention.</p>
				<p>I want to know what is said of our Capt: General's resignation<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.511tm" /> &amp; the causes of it, for this

					<salute> Dear S<hi rend="super">r</hi>
					</salute>
				</opener>
				<p> For the opinion of the South I refer you to the lordly conversation you were present at in the Bookseller's shop during York
						races.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.513tm" /> we are almost all Lords, &amp; the commonest events of English History are to us impenetrable
					&amp; inexplicable: however here were some different judgements. you saw the verses printed in the London Chronicle, &amp; supposed to
					be M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Garrick's;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.514tm" /> and (to make you friends with D<hi rend="super">r</hi>
					Warburton) I must tell you, he says, the World never judged so justly of any thing new, as of these Odes, for other compositions they
					have affected to like &amp; dislike, but these they own they do not understand; &amp; he heartily believes them: yet he does not doubt
					but they understand them full as well as Milton or Shakespeare, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> Fashion forces them to admire, this is what
					my Correspondents tell me, &amp; if they have put in a little more flattery, than belongs to the Doctor, I know you will excuse me for
					biting at it so readily. Dodsley, I find, has been as negligent with regard to several other Persons, as to you, but it is in vain to
					scold at a Bookseller, when your writings lie upon his hands by hundreds, as (I suppose) mine do. you see what my <hi>celebrity</hi>
					(that you promised me) is come to. pray, don't tell the People of Durham, to whom I am infinitely obliged, tho' they did not at all
					like me. there are some objections to the tradition you flatter me with:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.515tm" /> the Churchyard was publish'd
					Feb: 1751, &amp; I did not go thither<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.516tm" /> till Aug: 1753. I met with no weather, that would tempt me to
					sit under a tree; 3<hi rend="super">dly</hi> &amp; lastly, they have no trees to sit under.</p>
				<p> I have got the old Ballad, on w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> Douglas is founded.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.517tm" /> it is in my eyes a
					miracle not only of ancient simplicity, but of ancient art. the great rules of Aristotle &amp; Horace are observed in it by a Writer,
					who perhaps had never heard their names. what I say, is a great compliment to the Genius of the Scotch, but a still greater to Horace
					&amp; Aristotle. as to the Play, the single Scene of Matilda's interview with the old Peasant was the thing, that inchanted me; if all
					the rest had been wrote by Aaron Hill,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.518tm" /> I should have been still inchanted. pray keep
						your&#x2014;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.519tm" />you know what&#x2014;from interfering with your judgement in poetry. nothing belongs to
					this, but what Men say, &amp; what they do in different situations of life; not what they <hi>ought</hi> to say or do. I wish to God,
					that no good Man, or even no <hi>good Christian</hi>, had ever known what despair was: but I fear they have too often been hurried to
					their own destruction. Providence may have interposed to prevent it, but whether it does <hi>always</hi> interpose, only that
					Providence can tell. however this is <hi>gratis dictum</hi>, for Matilda is distracted, before she executes her purpose. another
					quarrel I have with you about Q: Elizabeth. I know she was a <hi>Bitch</hi>; but it is clear, on what your animosity is founded. indeed
					it runs in the blood. I suppose your ancestor S<hi rend="super">r</hi> H: B:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.520tm" /> many a time repented,
					that when he was her Keeper, he had not put a little in her cup of what she herself wish'd S<hi rend="super">r</hi> Amias Paulet<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.521tm" /> would put into that of Mary, Q: of Scots. before you offer to condemn her persecutions, let me know, what
					you think of those of her Sister Mary. believe me this topick of hanging &amp; burning is a thing, that no good Catholick ought ever to
					open his mouth about, till the measure on our Side is as full, as it is on yours. if you tell your Confessor this, he will enjoin you
					never to write to me more.</p>

				<p>This abrupt execution plunges the reader into that sudden fearful perplexity which is designed to predominate through the whole. the
					irresistible violence of the prophet's passions bears him away, who, as he is unprepared by a formal ushering in of the speaker, is
					unfortified against the impressions of his poetical phrenzy and overpowered by them, as sudden thunders strike the deepest.<anchor

				</p>
				<p>[ &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; ]</p>
				<p>Here a vision of triumphant revenge is judiciously made to ensue, after the pathetic lamentation which precedes it. Breaks &#x2013;
					double rhymes &#x2013; an appropriated cadence &#x2013; and an exalted ferocity of language forcibly picture to us the uncontroulable
					tumultuous workings of the prophet's stimulated bosom.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.527tm" />
				</p>
				<p>[ &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; ] </p>
				<p>Can there be an image more just, apposite, and nobly imagined than this tremendous tragical winding-sheet? In the rest of this stanza
					the wilderness of thought, expression, and cadence are admirably adapted to the character and situation of the speaker, and of the
					bloody spectres his assistants. It is not indeed peculiar to it alone, but a beauty that runs throughout the whole composition, that
					the historical events are briefly sketched out by a few striking circumstances, in which the Poet's office of rather exciting and
					directing, than satisfying the reader's imagination, is perfectly observed. Such abrupt hints, resembling the several fragments of a
					vast ruin, suffer not the mind to be raised to the utmost pitch, by one image of horror, but that instantaneously a second and a third
					are presented to it, and the affection is still uniformly supported.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.528tm" />

				<p>Tho' I very well know the bland emollient saponaceous qualities both of Sack &amp; Silver,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.541tm" /> yet if
					any great Man would say to me, 'I make you <hi rend="italic">Rat-Catcher</hi> to his Majesty with a salary of 300£ a-year &amp; two
					Butts of the best Malaga; and tho' it has been usual to catch a mouse or two (for form's sake) in publick once a year, yet to You, Sr,
					we shall not stand upon these things'. I can not say, I should jump at it. nay, if they would drop the very name of the Office, &amp;
					call me <hi rend="italic">Sinecure</hi> to the Kg's majesty I should still feel a little awkward, &amp; think every body, I saw, smelt
					a Rat about me: but I do not pretend to blame any one else, that has not the same sensations. for my part I would rather be
					Serjeant-Trumpeter, or Pin-Maker to the Palace. nevertheless I interest myself a little in the History of it, &amp; rather wish
					somebody may accept it,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.542tm" /> that will retrieve the credit of the thing, if it be retrievable, or ever had
					any credit. Rowe<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.543tm" /> was, I think, the last Man of character that had it. as to Settle,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.544tm" /> whom you mention, he belong'd to my Ld Mayor, not to the King. Eusden<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.545tm" /> was a
					Person of great hopes in his youth, tho' at last he turned out a drunken Parson. Dryden<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.546tm" /> was as
					disgraceful to the Office from his character, as the poorest Scribler could have been from his verses.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.547tm" />
					[In sh]ort<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.548tm" /> the office itself has always humbled the Pos[sess]or<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.548tm1" />
					hitherto (even in an age, when Kings were somebody) if he were a poor Writer by making him more conspicuous, and if he were a good one,
					by setting him at war with the little fry of his own profession, for there are poets little enough to envy even a Poet-Laureat.</p>
				<p>I am obliged to you for your news, pray send me some more, &amp; better of the sort. I can tell you nothing in return, so your
					generosity will be the greater. only Dick<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.549tm" /> is going to give up his rooms, &amp; live at Ashwell.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.550tm" /> Mr Treasurer<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.551tm" /> sets Sr M:w Lambe<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.552tm" /> at naught,
					&amp; says, he has sent him reasons half a sheet at a time; &amp; Mr Brown attests his veracity, as an eye-witness. I have had nine
					pages of criticism on the Bard sent me in an anonymous letter, directed to the <hi rend="italic">Revd</hi> Mr G: at Strawberry-Hill,
					&amp; if I have a mind to hear as much more on the other Ode, I am told, where I may direct.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.553tm" /> he seems
					a good sensible Man, &amp; I dare say, a Clergyman. he is very frank, &amp; indeed much ruder, than he means to be.</p>

					<salute>Dear Mr Gray. </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I send you with your anonymous Criticisms The produce of Xtmas. but first as to the Criticisms I think just as you do about them, yet
					I have so much good nature even for a Critic that I think I would write to him,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.556tm" /> tho on second thoughts
					it scarce signifys when one reflects what he has said about the famishd Eagle.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.557tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Now be it known unto you, I send you two Odes. One so very antient,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.558tm" /> that all the Æolian Lyres<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.559tm" /> that ever sounded are mere things of Yesterday in comparison. If you have a mind to trace my imagery, you'll
					find it all huddled together by Keysler, in his Antiquitates Selectæ Septentrionales &amp; Celticæ.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.560tm" />
					the Book I dont doubt is to be met with at Cambridge, &amp; if you have not seen it, you need only read his 2d Chapter. But tell me,
					may this sort of imagery be employd? Will its being Celtic make it Druidical? if it wont, burn it; if it will, why scratch it ad
					libitum, &amp; send it me back as soon as possible.</p>
				<p>The other Ode is as Modern as can be wishd &amp; is that upon wch I trust all my future Fame will be founded. While Lord Bolinbroke
					stands upon the Same Shelf with Malbranch &amp; Locke I have no fear but I shall squeeze myself between Soame Jennyns<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.561tm" /> &amp; Lord Chesterfield, &amp; I swear I wont give the pas to Sr Charles Hanbury.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.562tm" /> Well but who is this Mr Joliffe?<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.563tm" /> &amp; how came you acquainted with him?
					Lord! you are not one of us, you know nothing of Life. Why Mr Joliffe is a Booksellers Son, in St James's Street who takes Profiles
					with a Candle<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.564tm" /> better than any body. All Whites<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.565tm" /> have sat to him not to
					mention Prince Edward.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.566tm" /> at first his price was only half a Crown, but it is now raisd to a Crown and he
					has litterally got above a hundred Pounds by it. Return it with the other Ode. &amp; besure let no body see it except Mr Brown.</p>
				<p>I can't finish my Letter without telling you an excellent Story of Fobus.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.567tm" /> On the death of the
					Laureat, Lord Barrington<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.568tm" /> told him, he was very glad to find that I was not to succeed because it would
					be a shame to employ me in writing such stuff as Birthday Odes. Fobus said he did not know me. Lord B stard, &amp; told him he wonderd
					at that, "for that He of all People ought to know me." Still Fobus was ignorant; in Short Lord B was obligd to rattle the installation
						Ode<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.569tm" /> in his Ears before Fobus would own to the least Bit of remembrance. Pray tell this story to evry
					body, tis matter of fact &amp; I think to both our Credits.</p>
				<p>Adieu, I woud give all Im worth that is to say Caractacus &amp; my Ode to Mr. Jolliffe to see an Ode to the King of Prussia by YOUR
					Hand, he has certainly taken Breslau<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.570tm" /> &amp; in it 14 General Officers &amp; 10,000 Prisoners</p>

					<salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Why you make no more of writing an Ode, &amp; throwing it into the fire, than of buckling and unbuckling your shoe. I have never read
						Keysler's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.582tm" /> book, nor you neither I believe: if you had taken that pains, I am persuaded you would have
					seen that his Celtic &amp; his Septentrional antiquities are two things entirely distinct. there are indeed some learned Persons, who
					have taken pains to confound, what Cæsar &amp; Tacitus have taken pains to separate, the old druidical or Celtic belief, &amp; that of
					the old Germans. but nobody has been so <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> as to mix the Celtic religion with that of the Goths. why, Woden
					himself is supposed not to have been older than Julius Cæsar; but let him have lived, when he pleases, it is certain that neither he,
					nor his <hi rend="italic">Valhalla,</hi> were heard of, till many ages after. this is the doctrine of the <hi rend="italic"
						>Scalds,</hi> not of the Bards. these are the songs of Hengist &amp; Horsa, a modern new-fangled belief in comparison of that, wch you
					ought to profess. after all I shall be sorry to have so many good verses &amp; good chimæras thrown away. might we not be permitted (in
					that scarcity of Celtic Ideas we labour under) to adopt some of these foreign whimsies, dropping however all mention of Woden, &amp;
					his Valkhyrian Virgins, &amp;c: to settle this scruple of conscience I must refer you to Dr Warburton. if this should be his opinion,
					(wch I doubt) then I go on to tell you, (first premising that a <hi rend="italic">dirge</hi> is always a funeral service sung over
					persons already dead) that I would have something striking &amp; uncommon in the measures, the rhythm, &amp; the expression of this
					chorus. the two former are not remarkable here, &amp; the third is so little antiquated, that <hi rend="italic">murky &amp; dank</hi>
					look like two oldmaids of honour got into a circle of fleering girls &amp; boys. now for particulars; I like the first Stanza, the
					Image of Death in arms is very fine, &amp; gallant, but I banish <hi rend="italic">fre-born</hi> train, &amp; <hi rend="italic">glory
						&amp; luxury</hi> here (not the ideas, but the words) &amp; <hi rend="italic">Liberty, &amp; Freedom's</hi> cause, &amp; several <hi
						rend="italic">small</hi> epithets throughout. I do not see how one Person can <hi rend="italic">lift</hi> the voice of another Person.
					the imagery of the second Stanza too is excellent. a Dragon <hi rend="italic">pecks,</hi> why a Cock-Sparrow might do as much! in short
					I am pleased with the Gothic Elysium; don't think I am ignorant about either that or the <hi rend="italic">Hell</hi> before, or the <hi
						rend="italic">twilight.</hi> I have been there &amp; have seen it all in <hi rend="italic">Mallet's Introduction to the history of
						Denmark</hi> (it is in French)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.583tm" /> &amp; many other places. <hi rend="italic">Now they charge</hi>
					&amp;c: looks, as if the <hi rend="italic">Coursers</hi> rode upon the Men. a <hi rend="italic">Ghost</hi> does not <hi rend="italic"
						>fall.</hi> these are all my little objections, but I have a greater. extreme conciseness of expression, yet pure, perspicuous, &amp;
					musical, is one of the grand beauties of lyric poetry. this I have always aim'd at, &amp; never could attain. the necessity of rhyming
					is one great obstacle to it: another &amp; perhaps a stronger is that way you have chosen of casting down your first Ideas carelessly
					&amp; at large, and then clipping them here &amp; there and forming them at leisure. this method after all possible pains will leave
					behind it in some places a <hi rend="italic">laxity,</hi> a diffuseness. the frame of a thought (otherwise well invented, well-turned,
					&amp; well-placed) is often weaken'd by it. do I talk nonsense? or do you understand me? I am persuaded, what I say, is true <hi
						rend="italic">in my head,</hi> whatever it may be in <hi rend="italic">prose,</hi> for I do not pretend to write prose.</p>
				<p>I am extremely pleased with your fashionable Ode,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.584tm" /> &amp; have nothing to find fault with there (only
					you must say <hi rend="italic">portray' st</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.585tm" /> in the first Stanza; &amp; It <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> at best but skin,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.586tm" /> in the 4th, is not right) I have observed your orders, but I want to shew it every body. pray, tell me, when
					I may have the credit of doing so. I have never seen a prettier <hi rend="italic">modernism:</hi> let it be seen, while it is
						warm.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.587tm" /> you are in the road to fame, but don't tell your name at first, whatever you may venture to do
					afterwards.</p>
				<p>Fobus is a treat:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.588tm" /> desire Ld &#x2014;sse to kiss him on both ears for me. I forgive Ld B.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.589tm" /> for taking the <hi rend="italic">Tudors</hi> for the Restauration. Adieu, dear M:n &amp; remember me.

					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I beleive you are quite right, as you always are in these matters. But it is a little hard upon my no-reading, to beleive I have not
					read Keisler.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.595tm" /> I have I assure you, and he led me into the mistake. He has a Chapter on the notions the
					northern nations had of a future state. first of all he talks of the Metempsichosis wch every body allows Druidical (except
						Pelloutier.)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.596tm" /> &amp; then says 'Hi qui sine animarum transmigratione aliam post obitum vitam superesse
					statuebant, duplices primo animarum sedes faciebant. Alius enim status erat earum<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.597tm" /> ante CREPUSCULUM
					DEORUM alius post illud.' &amp; then goes on to describe His Hell &amp; his Valhalla. But Sr W. Temple set me right about the low date
					of these Ideas<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.598tm" /> before I recd yours. I have therefore laid aside the Ode, &amp; shall make no use of it
					at all, except perhaps the Image of the Armed Death wch is my own, &amp; neither Scaldic nor runic. &amp; as to this nasty German
					Keisler who led me to take all this trouble, Ill never open him again. The fool was a fellow of the Royal Society what could one expect
					better from him.</p>
				<p>But after all, I do wish indeed that these Odes were all of them finishd, &amp; yet by what you talk of Measure &amp; Rhythm &amp;
					expression I think I shall never be able to finish them, never certainly at all if Im not to throw out my Ideas at large. So whether I
					am right or wrong I must have my way in that, Therefore talk no more about it. &#x2013; Well you like my other Ode however &#x2013; So
					Ill turn Wit, tho that, according to Popes gradation to <hi rend="italic">plain fool,</hi> should have come before <hi rend="italic"
						>Poetry.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.599tm" /> However as times go, tis well, it comes any how. But hold, I cannot part with Poetry till it has
					servd me a few friendly turns, &amp; when it has done that it may go to Fobus if it pleases, or to the Devil. One of these friendly
					turns it has done already &amp; you will have it<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.600tm" /> enclosed if my excellent Fraser<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.601tm" /> transcribes it in Time. Let me have your Strictures speedily, because I want to send it to Wood.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.602tm" /> take notice the lines descriptive of his Garden are strictly <hi rend="italic">peculiar,</hi> &amp;
						Whitehead<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.603tm" /> who has seen the place tells me they are the very thing, nothing can be conceivd so flowry
					so fragrant &amp; so Shady as the foreground nothing more extensive &amp; riant than the Offskip.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.604tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Yet I can't let this elegy come to you without begging that as you are stout you will be merciful to it, for I feel for it somehow as
					if it was a favrite Child, and I will give you a Hundred Druidical Odes, to burn in your Critical Colossus, if youll let it live. Lord!
					I know nothing of Dupps<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.605tm" /> being made Chancellor of the exchequer unless its a thing of course after hes
					made recorder of Cambridge, sure you had your intelligence from Mr Alderman Marshall.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.606tm" /> Dont beleive a
					Word what the papers tell you, that the Childs name was Mary, twas Concubinage,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.607tm" /> &amp; Dr
						Shebbeare<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.608tm" /> is to teach it its Catechize.</p>
				<p>Pray Mr Gray! why wont you make your Muse do now and then a friendly turn? An Idle Slut as she is! If she was to throw out her Ideas
					never so carelessly it would satisfy some folks that I know, but I wont name names, &amp; therefore I wont sign all the nonsence I have

					hear, what he has to say about the other ode, I am told to direct to A: B: inclosed to the Post-Master at Andover. after what I have

				<p>I am almost blind with a great cold, &amp; should not have wrote to you today, if you did not hurry me to send back this
						elegy.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.618tm" /> my advices are allways at your service to take or to refuse, therefore you should not call
					them <hi rend="italic">severe.</hi> you know I do not love, much less pique myself on criticism, and think even a bad verse as good a
					thing or better, than the best observation, that ever was made upon it. I like greatly what you have now sent me, particularly the
					spirit &amp; sentiment of it. the disposition of the whole too is natural &amp; elegiac. as to the expression I would venture to say
					(did you not forbid me)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.619tm" /> that it is sometimes too <hi rend="italic">easy.</hi> the last line I protest
					against. (this, you will say, is worse, than blotting out rhymes) the descriptive part is excellent, yet I am sorry for the name of <hi
						rend="italic">Cutthorpe.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.620tm" /> I had rather Vertumnus &amp; Flora did not appear in person. the word <hi rend="italic">lopt</hi>
					sounds like a Farmer, or a Man of taste. <hi rend="italic">a Mountain hoar, the savage</hi> &amp;c: is a very good line, yet I allways
					doubt, if this ungrammatical construction be allowable. in common speech it is usual, but not in writing even prose; &amp; I think,
					Milton (tho' hard-press'd by his short metre in the Penseroso) yet finds a way to bring in his <hi rend="italic">thats,</hi> his <hi
						rend="italic">whos,</hi> &amp; his <hi rend="italic">whiches. fair unfold The wide-spread</hi> &amp;c: <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> is
					weakly; <hi rend="italic">wide-spread</hi> is contained in <hi rend="italic">unfold.</hi> by <hi rend="italic">amber</hi> mead I
					understand the yellow gleam of a meadow cover'd with marshmarygolds &amp; butterflowers. is not it so? the two first lines (the 2d
					especially) I do not admire. I read <hi rend="italic">Did Fancy</hi> wake not &#x2013; <hi rend="italic">refuse</hi> one votive strain.
					you will ask me, why? I do not know. as to <hi rend="italic">votive</hi> it is like <hi rend="italic">delegated,</hi> one of the words
					you love. I also read <hi rend="italic">How</hi> well does Mem'ry &amp;c: for the same no reason. <hi rend="italic">Enough, it all was
						his</hi> &amp;c: I like the sense, but it is not sufficiently clear. as to the versification, do not you perceive that you make the
					pause on the fourth syllable in almost every other line?</p>
				<p>Now I desire, you would neither think me severe, nor at all regard what I say any farther, than it coincides with your own judgement:
					for the Child deserves your partiality, it is a healthy well-made boy with an ingenuous countenance,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.621tm" />
					&amp; promises to live long. I would only wash its face, dress it a little, make it walk upright &amp; strong, &amp; keep it from
					learning <hi rend="italic">paw</hi> words.</p>
				<p>I never saw more than two volumes of Pelloutier,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.622tm" /> &amp; repent, that I ever read them. he is an idle
					Man of some learning, that would make all the world <hi rend="italic">Celts,</hi> whether they will or no. <hi rend="italic">Locus est
						&amp; pluribus umbris</hi> is a very good Motto;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.623tm" /> you need look no farther: I can not find the other

				<p>[ &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; ]</p>
				<p>A poet is perhaps never more conciliating than when he praises favourite predecessors in his art. Milton is not more the pride than
					Shakespear the love of their country: It is therefore equally judicious to diffuse a tenderness and a grace through the praise of
					Shakespear, as to extol in a strain more elevated and sonorous the boundless soarings of Milton's epic imagination.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.627tm" />
				</p>
				<p>[ &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; ]</p>
				<p>I quit this Ode<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.628tm" /> with the strongest conviction of its abundant merit; though I took it up, (for this
					last attentive perusal) persuaded that it was not a little inferior to the other. They are not the treasures of imagination only that
					have so copiously enriched it: It speaks, but surely less feelingly than the Bard, (still my favourite) to the heart. Can we in truth
					be equally interested, for the fabulous exploded Gods of other nations (celebrated in the first half of this Ode) as by the story of
					our own Edwards and Henrys, or allusions to it? Can a description, the most perfect language ever attained to, of tyranny expelling the
					muses from Parnassus, seize the mind equally with the horrors of Berkley Castle,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.629tm" /> with the apostrophe
					to the tower? <q>
						<p>And spare the meek Usurper's holy head!<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.630tm" />
						</p>
					</q> I do not mean, however, wholly to decry fabulous subjects or allusions, nor more than to suggest the preference due to historical
					ones, where happily the Poet's fertile imagination supplies him with a plentiful choice of both kinds, and he finds himself capable of
					treating both, according to their respective natures, with equal advantage. </p>

					<salute> Dear S<hi rend="super">r</hi>
					</salute>
				</opener>
				<p> Having been for a little while in Huntingdonshire,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.632tm" /> on my return to this place I find a letter from
					you, the end of w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> gives me much concern. I am very sorry we are at such a distance from one another, that it
					must be yet some time, before I can have any account of your health. if you are, as I flatter myself, recover'd, you will (I hope) do
					me the pleasure of letting me hear it without delay. if so much of your indisposition remain as to make writing at all troublesome to
					you, may I presume so far on the good-nature of Miss Swinburne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.633tm" /> as to beg She would give me three
					lines of information. this young Lady has done me so great an honour already, as gives me courage to apply myself to her on this
					occasion. I preserve (&amp; always shall preserve with great care) the beautiful little Specimen of her art, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi>
					came inclosed in your letter. I am only sorry, that when I would shew &amp; make my boast of it to eyes, that are worthy of that
					satisfaction, I shall be obliged to cover a part of it, &amp; consequently to rob her of a part of her due praises. this is your fault
					(for I hope you did not explain the Latin inscription<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.634tm" /> to her). however I return my thanks to you both,
					to Miss Sw: for all above board, &amp; to You, for what only I am to see.</p>

					<salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>A life spent out of the World has its hours of despondence, its inconveniences, its sufferings, as numerous, &amp; as real (tho' not
					quite of the same sort) as a life spent in the midst of it. the power we have, when we will exert it, over our own minds, join'd to a
					little strength &amp; consolation, nay, a little pride, we catch from those, that seem to love us, is our only support in either of
					these conditions. I am sensible I can not return to you so much of this assistance as I have received from you. I can only tell you,
					that one, who has far more reason, than you (I hope) will ever have, to look on life with something worse than indifference, is yet no
					enemy to it, and can look backward on many bitter moments partly with satisfaction &amp; partly with patience, and forward too on a
					scene not very promising with some hope &amp; some expectations of a better day. the conversation you mention seems to me to have been
					in some measure the cause of your <hi rend="italic">reflection.</hi> as you do not describe the manner (wch is very essential &amp; yet
					can not easily be described) to be sure I can judge but very imperfectly of it. but if (as you say) it ended very amicably, why not
					take it as amicably? in most cases I am a great Friend to Eclaircissements: it is no pleasant task to enter upon them, therefore it is
					always some merit in the Person, who does so. I am in the dark too as to what you have said of &#x2014;;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.645tm"
					 /> to whom, where, before whom, how did it come round? for you certainly would not do it indiscriminately, nor without a little
					reserve. I do not mean on your own account, (for he is an object of contempt, that would naturally tempt any one to laugh, or bepiss
					himself,) but for the <hi rend="italic">Person's</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.646tm" /> sake, with whom you so often are, who (merely from his situation) must neither laugh, nor bepiss
					himself, as you &amp; I might do. who knows? any little imprudence (wch it is so pleasant to indulge) might really be disagreable in
					its consequences to him, for it would be said infallibly, tho' very unjustly, that you would not dare to take these liberties without
					private encouragement, at least that he had no aversion to hear in secret, what you ventured to say in publick. you do not imagine,
					that the <hi rend="italic">World</hi> (wch always concludes wrong about the motives of such minds, as it has not been used to) will
					think you have any sentiments of your own, &amp; tho' you (if you thought it worth while) might wish to convince them of their mistake,
					yet you would not do it at the expence of another, especially of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> other. in short I think (as far as I know)
					you have no reason from this to take any such resolution as you meditate. make use of it in its season, as a relief from what is
					tiresome to you, but not as if it was in consequence of something you take ill. on the contrary if such a conference had happen'd about
					the time of your <hi rend="italic">transmigration,</hi> I would defer it, to avoid that appearance merely. for the frankness of this
					proceeding has to me an appearance of friendliness, that one would by no means wish to suppress.</p>
				<p>I am ashamed not to have return'd Mr Hurd my thanks for his book,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.647tm" /> pray do it for me in the civilest
					manner &amp; tell him I shall be here till April, when I must go for a short time to Town, but shall return again hither:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.648tm" /> I rejoice to hear he is again coming out, &amp; had no notion of his being so ready for ye Press.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.649tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I wrote to the Man (as you bid me) &amp; had a second criticism: his name (for I desired to know it) is Butler.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.650tm" /> he is, he says, of the number of those, who live, less contented than they ought, in an independent
					indolence, can just afford himself a horse for airings about Harewood-Forest (the Scene of Elfrida)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.651tm" />
					half-a-score new books in a season, &amp; good part of half an acre of garden-ground for honeysuckles &amp; roses. did you know that
					Harewood was near Andover? I think, that you had some Friend in that neighbourhood. is it not Mr Bourne?<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.652tm"
					 /> however don't enquire, for our correspondence is to be a profound secret.</p>

				<p> I feel very ungrateful (wch is the most uneasy of all feelings) in that I have never once enquired, how you and your family enjoy
					the region of air &amp; sunshine, into which you are removed,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.655tm" /> &amp; with what contempt you look back

						rend="italic">next summer</hi> in the Grotto. but I am much puzzled about the Bishop &amp; his fixtures,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.657tm"
					 /> &amp; do not stomach the loss of that money.</p>
				<p>Would you know, what I am doing? I doubt, you have been told already, &amp; hold my employment cheap enough: but every one must judge
					of his own <hi rend="italic">capabilities,</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> his amusements according to his disposition. the drift
					of my present studies is to know, wherever I am, what lies within reach, that may be worth seeing. whether it be Building, ruin, park,
					garden, prospect, picture, or monument; to whom it does, or has belong'd, &amp; what has been the characteristick, &amp; taste of
					different ages. you will say, this is the object of all Antiquaries, but pray, what Antiquary ever saw these objects in the same light,
					or desired to know them for a like reason? in short say what you please, I am persuaded, whenever my list<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.658tm"
					 /> is finish'd, you will approve it, &amp; think it of no small use. my spirits are very near the <hi rend="italic">freezing
						point,</hi> &amp; for some hours of the day this exercise by its warmth &amp; gentle motion serves to raise them a few degrees higher.
					I hope the misfortune, that has befall'n Mrs. Cibber's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.659tm" /> Canary-bird will not be the ruin of <hi
						rend="italic">Agis.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.660tm" /> it is probable you will have curiosity enough to see it, as it comes from the Writer of Douglas: I
					expect your opinion. I am told, that Swift's History of the Tory-Administration<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.661tm" /> is in the Press, &amp;

				<p>It is indeed for want of spirits, as you suspect, that my studies lie among the Cathedrals, and the Tombs,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.665tm" /> and the Ruins. To think, though to little purpose, has been the chief amusement of my days; and when I would
					not, or cannot think, I dream. At present I find myself able to write a Catalogue,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.666tm" /> or to read the
					Peerage book, or Miller's Gardening Dictionary,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.667tm" /> and am thankful that there are such employments and
					such authors in the world. Some people, who hold me cheap for this, are doing perhaps what is not half so well worth while. As to
					posterity, I may ask, (with some body<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.668tm" /> whom I have forgot) what has it ever done to oblige me?</p>
				<p>To make a transition from myself to as poor a subject, the Tragedy of Agis;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.669tm" /> I cry to think that it
					should be by the Author of Douglas: Why, it is all modern Greek; the story is an antique statue painted white and red, frized, and
					dressed in a negligée made by a Yorkshire mantua-maker. Then here is the Miscellany<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.670tm" /> (Mr Dodsley has
					sent me the whole set gilt and lettered, I thank him). Why, the two last volumes are worse than the four first; particularly Dr
						Akenside<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.671tm" /> is in a deplorable way. What signifies Learning and the Antients, (Mason will say
					triumphantly) why should people read Greek to lose their imagination, their ear, and their mother tongue? But then there is Mr
						Shenstone,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.672tm" /> who trusts to nature and simple sentiment, why does he do no better? he goes hopping along
					his own gravel-walks, and never deviates from the beaten paths for fear of being lost.</p>
				<p>I have read Dr Swift,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.673tm" /> and am disappointed. There is nothing of the negotiations that I have not seen
					better in M. de Torcy<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.674tm" /> before. The manner is careless, and has little to distinguish it from common
					writers. I meet with nothing to please me but the spiteful characters of the opposite party and its leaders. I expected much more
					secret history. </p>

				<p>I have full as much <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi> as yourself, tho' much less dissipation, but I can not make this my excuse for being
					silent, for I write to you <hi rend="italic">pour me desennuyer,</hi> tho' I have little enough to say. I know not, whether I am to
					condole with you on this Canterbury Business,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.677tm" /> for it is not clear to me, that You or the Church are
					any great Losers by it. if you are; be so good to inform me, &amp; I will be sorry. however there is one good thing in it: it proves
					the Family are mortal.</p>
				<p>You do not seem to discover, that Mons: Mallet<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.678tm" /> is but a very small Scholar, except in the erudition
					of the Goths. there are a-propos two Dissertations on the Religion &amp; Opinions of the Gauls, publish'd in the <hi rend="italic"
						>Memoires de l'Acad. des Belles-Lettres &amp; des Inscriptions,</hi> Vol. 24me.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.679tm" /> 4to. one by the Abbé
						Fenel,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.680tm" /> in wch he would shew, that about Tiberius, and Claudius times the Druids, persecuted &amp;
					dispersed by the Romans, probably retired into Germany &amp; propagated their doctrines there. this is to account for some similitude
					to the Gaulish notions wch the religion of Germany seems to bear, as Tacitus has described it, whereas J: Cæsar makes them extremely
					different, who lived before this supposed dispersion of ye Druids. the other by Mons:r Freret<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.681tm" /> is to
					shew the reverse of all this, that there was no such dispersion, no such similitude, and that if Cæsar &amp; Tacitus disagree, it is
					because the first knew nothing but of those Nations that border'd on the Rhine, &amp; the other was acquainted with all Germany. I do
					not know, whether these will furnish you with any new matter, but they are well enough wrote &amp; easily read. I told you before (that
					in a time of dearth) I would venture to borrow from the Edda without entering too minutely on particulars: but if I did so, I would
					make each image so clear, that it might be fully understood by itself, for in this obscure mythology we must not hint at things, as we
					do with the Greek Fables, that every body is supposed to know at school. however on second thoughts I think it would be still better to
					graft any wild picturesque fable absolutely of one's own invention upon the Druid-Stock, I mean upon those half-dozen of old fancies,
					that are known to have made their system. this will give you more freedom &amp; latitude, &amp; will leave no hold for the Criticks to
					fasten on.</p>
				<p>Pray, when did I pretend to finish, or even insert passages into other people's works? as if it were equally easy to pick holes,
					&amp; to mend them.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.682tm" /> all I can say is, that your elegy must not end with the worst line in it. it is
					flat, it is prose, whereas that above all ought to sparkle, or at least to shine. if the sentiment must stand, twirl it a little into
					an apophegm,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.683tm" /> stick a flower in it, gild it with a costly expression, let it strike the fancy, the ear,
					or the heart, &amp; I am satisfied.</p>
				<p>

				</opener>
				<p>I am equally sensible of your affliction,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.690tm" /> &amp; of your kindness, that made you think of me at such
					a moment. would to God, I could lessen the one, or requite the other with that consolation, wch I have often received from you, when I
					most wanted it! but your grief is too just, &amp; the cause of it too fresh, to admit of any such endeavour. what indeed is all human
					consolation, can it efface every little amiable word or action of an object we loved, from our memory? can it convince us, that all the
					hopes we had entertain'd, the plans of future satisfaction we had form'd, were ill-grounded &amp; vain, only because we have lost them?
					the only comfort (I am afraid) that belongs to our condition is to reflect (when time has given us leisure for reflection) that others
					have suffer'd worse, or that we ourselves might have suffer'd the same misfortune at times &amp; in circumstances, that would probably
					have aggravated our sorrow. you might have seen this poor Child arrive at an age to fulfill all your hopes, to attach you more strongly
					to him by long habit, by esteem, as well as natural affection, &amp; that towards the decline of your life, when we most stand in need
					of support, &amp; when he might chance to have been your <hi rend="italic">only</hi> support; &amp; then by some unforeseen &amp;
					deplorable accident, or some painful ling'ring distemper you might have lost him. such has been the fate of many an unhappy Father! I
					know, there is a sort of tenderness, wch Infancy &amp; Innocence alone produce, but I think, you must own the other to be a stronger
					&amp; more overwhelming Sorrow.</p>
				<p>I am glad Mrs Wharton has fortitude enough not to suffer this misfortune to prevail over her, &amp; add to the natural weakness of
					her present condition. Mr Brown sincerely sympathizes with you, &amp; begs to be kindly remember'd to you both. I have been [ ]<anchor

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I am much concern'd to hear the account you give of yourself, &amp; particularly for that dejection of spirits, wch inclines you to
					see every thing in the worst light possible, and throw a sort of voluntary gloom not only over your present, but future days, as if
					even your situation now were not preferable to that of thousands round you, &amp; as if your prospect hereafter might not open as much
					of happiness to you, as to any Person you know. the condition of our life perpetually instructs us to be rather slow to hope, as well
					as to despair, &amp; (I know, you will forgive me, if I tell you) you are often a little too hasty in both, perhaps from constitution.
					it is sure, we have great power over our own minds, when we chuse to exert it; &amp; tho it be difficult to resist the mechanic impulse
					&amp; biass of our own temper, it is yet possible; &amp; still more so, to delay those resolutions it inclines us to take, wch we
					almost always have cause to repent. </p>
				<p>You tell me nothing of Mrs Wharton's, or your own state of health. I will not talk to you more on this subject, till I hear you are
					both well, for that is the grand point, &amp; without it we may as well not think at all. You flatter me in thinking, that any thing, I
					can do,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.693tm" /> could at all alleviate the just concern your late loss has given you: but I can not flatter
					myself so far, &amp; know how little qualified I am at present to give any satisfaction to myself on this head, &amp; in this way, much
					less to you. I by no means pretend to inspiration, but yet I affirm, that the faculty in question is by no means voluntary.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.694tm" /> it is the result (I suppose) of a certain disposition of mind, wch does not depend on oneself, &amp; wch I
					have not felt this long time. you that are a witness, how seldom this spirit has moved me in my life, may easily give credit to what I
					say. &#x2013;</p>
				<p>I am in hopes of seeing you very soon again in my way to Stoke. Mrs Rogers<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.695tm" /> has been very ill this
					spring, &amp; my other Aunt<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.696tm" /> writes me word, that she herself has had something, (wch she takes for a
					paralytic stroke) wch came as she walk'd in the garden, &amp; is afraid, she shall lose the use of one leg: so that it looks to me, as
					if I should have perhaps some years to pass in a house with two poor bed-ridden Women, a melancholy object, &amp; one that in common
					humanity I can not avoid. I shall be glad to know, whether I can be in Gloucester-street<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.697tm" /> for a week
					ten or twelve days hence.</p>
				<p>I had wrote to you sooner, but that I have been on a little expedition<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.698tm" /> lately to see Ely,
					Peterborough, Crowland-Abbey,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.699tm" /> Thorney,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.700tm" /> Fotheringhey,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.701tm" /> &amp; many other old places, wch has amused me a little.</p>
				<p>Poor Mason is all alone at Aston (for his Curate<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.702tm" /> is gone to be Tutor to somebody) with an
					inflammation in his eyes, &amp; could scarce see to write me a few lines.</p>

					functions, &amp; even your attentions to the Dutchess of Norfolk<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.705tm" /> &amp; Sir Coniers,<anchor

					summer, or the country, that used to make you so voluminous: it was emulation, it was rivalry, it was the collision of tragedy against
					tragedy, that kindled your fires, &amp; set old Mona in a blaze. you do not say, who succeeds her Trojan Majesty; it ought to be well
					consider'd: let me have none of your prosaic Curates. I shall have you write Sermons, &amp; private Forms, &amp; Heavens open to all

					but books: yet books they must hold, &amp; all the bulky old Commentators, the Synopses, &amp; Tractatus Tractatuums,<anchor

					<salute>Dear Doctr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I have been, since I saw you in Town, pretty much on the wing, at Hampton, Twickenham, &amp; elsewhere. I staid at the first of these
					places with the Cobhams<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.730tm" /> two days &amp; should (I own) gladly have done so longer, but for the
						reason<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.731tm" /> we talk'd about. the place spite of the weather is delightful: every little gleam of sunshine,
					every accident of light, opens some new beauty in the view, &amp; I never saw in so small a spot so much variety, &amp; so many natural
					advantages, nor ever hardly wish'd more for your company to partake of them. we were also at Hampton-Court, Sion,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.732tm" /> &amp; several places in the neighbourhood again, particularly at Ld Lincoln's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.733tm"
					 /> who (I think) is hurting his view by two plantations in front of his terrace, that regularly answer one another, &amp; are of an
					oval form with rustic buildings in the middle of them, a farm, dairies, &amp;c:. they stand on the opposite side of the water, &amp;
					(as they prosper) will join their shade to that of the hills in the horizon, exclude all the intermediate scene of enclosures, meadows,
					&amp; cattle feeding, &amp; reduce that great distance to nothing. this seems to be the advice of some new Gardiner, or Director of my
					Lord's Taste; his Successor perhaps may cut all down again.</p>
				<p>I shall beg the favor of you (as you were so kind to offer it) to buy us a Lottery-Ticket,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.734tm" /> if you
					find the Market will not be much lower than at present; &amp; (if you think it has no great hazard in it) enclose it to me here: I will
					take care to repay you as soon as I come to Town, or (if you chuse it) directly. my best respects to Mrs Wharton. pray let me hear
					soon, how you both are.</p>

				<p>Dear Mason I was just leaving Cambridge<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.736tm" /> at the time, when I received your last letter, &amp; have
					been unfix'd &amp; flitting about almost eversince, or you had heard of me sooner. you do not think I could stay to receive Fobus. no
					more did Mr. H:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.737tm" /> he was gone into Leicestershire<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.738tm" /> long before; as to
					Uncle B:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.739tm" /> pray do him justice. he stay'd indeed to preach the Commencement-Sermon, but he assured me
					(in secret) it was an old one, &amp; had not one word in it <hi rend="italic">to the purpose.</hi> the very next morning he set out for
						Winchester,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.740tm" /> &amp; I do really think him much improved since he had his residence there, freer &amp;
					more open, &amp; his heart less set upon the Mammon of unrighteousness. a-propos, would you think it, Fobus has wit. he told Y:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.741tm" /> (who was invited to supper at Dr L:s,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.742tm" /> &amp; made all the company wait for
					him), 'Why, Y:e, you make but an aukward figure, now you are a Bp; this time last year you would have been the first man here.'</p>
				<p>I can not brag of my spirits, my situation, my employments, or my fertility. the days &amp; the nights pass, &amp; I am never the
					nearer to any thing but that one, to wch we are all tending. yet I love People, that leave some traces of their journey behind them,
					&amp; have strength enough to advise you to do so, while you can. I expect to see Caractacus compleated, not so much from the opinion I
					entertain of your industry, as from the consideration that another winter approaches, which is the season of harvest to an Author; but
					I will conceal the secret of your motives, &amp; join in the common applause. the books you enquire after are not worth your knowledge.
						Parnell<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.743tm" /> is the dunghill of Irish-Grubstreet. I did hear, who L:t Temple<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.744tm"
					 /> was, but have really forgot: I know, I thought it was Mr Greville.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.745tm" /> Avon<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.746tm" /> is nothing but a Type. the Dss of Queensberry's Advertisement<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.747tm" /> has moved my
					impatience, yet after all perhaps she may curl her grey hair with her Grandfather's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.748tm" /> golden periods.
					another object of my wishes is the K: of Prussia's Account of the Campaign,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.749tm" /> wch Niphausen<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.750tm" /> talk'd of 6 weeks ago, as just coming over, but it is not come: perhaps he waits for a better Catastrophe.
					the Twickenham-Press is in labour of two or three works<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.751tm" /> (not of the Printer's own) one of them is an
					Account of Russia by a Lord Whitworth,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.752tm" /> who (I think) was Minister there from King William.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.753tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I seem to have told you all I know, wch you will think very little, but <hi rend="italic">a nihilo nil fit.</hi> if I were to coin my
					whole mind into phrases, they would profit you nothing, nor fill a moderate page: compassionate my poverty, shew yourself noble in

				<p>I am as sorry as you seem to be, that our acquaintance<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.758tm" /> harped so much on the subject of materialism,
					when I saw him with you in town, because it was plain to which side of the longdebated question he inclined. That we are indeed
					mechanical and dependent beings, I need no other proof than my own feelings; and from the same feelings I learn, with equal conviction,
					that we are not <hi rend="italic">merely</hi> such: that there is a power within that struggles against the force and biass of that
					mechanism, commands its motion, and, by frequent practice, reduces it to that ready obedience which we call <hi rend="italic"
						>Habit;</hi> and all this in conformity to a preconceived opinion (no matter whether right or wrong) to that least material of all
					agents, a Thought. I have known many in his case who, while they thought they were conquering an old prejudice, did not perceive they
					were under the influence of one far more dangerous; one that furnishes us with a ready apology for all our worst actions, and opens to
					us a full licence for doing whatever we please; and yet these very people were not at all the more indulgent to other men (as they
					naturally should have been), their indignation to such as offended them, their desire of revenge on any body that hurt them was nothing
					mitigated: In short, the truth is, they wished to be persuaded of that opinion for the sake of its convenience, but were not so in
					their heart; and they would have been glad (as they ought in common prudence) that nobody else should think the same, for fear of the
					mischief that might ensue to themselves. His French Author I never saw, but have read fifty in the same strain, and shall read no more.
					I can be wretched enough without them. They put me in mind of the Greek Sophist<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.759tm" /> that got immortal
					honour by discoursing so feelingly on the miseries of our condition, that fifty of his audience went home and hanged themselves; yet he
					lived himself (I suppose) many years after in very good plight. </p>
				<p>You say you cannot conceive how Lord Shaftesbury<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.760tm" /> came to be a Philosopher in vogue; I will tell you:
					First, he was a Lord; 2dly, he was as vain as any of his readers; 3dly, men are very prone to believe what they do not understand;
					4thly, they will believe any thing at all, provided they are under no obligation to believe it; 5thly, they love to take a new road,
					even when that road leads no where; 6thly, he was reckoned a fine writer,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.761tm" /> and seemed always to mean
					more than he said. Would you have any more reasons? An interval of above forty years<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.762tm" /> has pretty well
					destroyed the charm. A dead Lord ranks but with Commoners: Vanity is no longer interested in the matter, for the new road has become an
					old one. The mode of free-thinking is like that of Ruffs and Farthingales, and has given place to the mode of not thinking at all; once
					it was reckoned graceful, half to discover and half conceal the mind, but now we have been long accustomed to see it quite naked:
					primness and affectation of style, like the good breeding of Queen Ann's Court, has turned to hoydening and rude familiarity.<anchor

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I ought to have informed you sooner, that I had received the Ticket<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.765tm" /> you were so good to buy for me,
					but I have been obliged to go every day almost to Stoke-house,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.766tm" /> where the Garricks have been all the
					last week. they are now gone, &amp; I am not sorry for it, for I grow so old, that, I own, People in high spirits &amp; gayety
					overpower me, &amp; entirely take away mine. I can yet be diverted with their sallies, but if they appear to take notice of my
					dullness, it sinks me to nothing. I do not know, whether you will blame me, but I found so good an opportunity given me of entering
					into the quarrel between M:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.767tm" /> and him, that I could not help seizing it, &amp; trying to shew him the
					folly of hearkening to half-witted friends &amp; tale-bearers; and the greater folly of attempting to hurt, or merely to pique, so
					worthy &amp; so estimable a Man. if I did nothing else, I at least convinced him, that I spoke entirely from myself; &amp; that I had
					the most entire good opinion &amp; most unalterable respect as well as kindness for M:n.</p>
				<p>I congratulate you on our successes, &amp; condole with you on our misfortunes:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.768tm" /> but do you think we
					draw the nearer to any happy conclusion of the war, or that we can bear so great a burthen much longer. the K: of Prussia's situation
					embarrasses me, surrounded as he is, &amp; reduced to the defence of his own little Marquisate.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.769tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Your Encyclopedie<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.770tm" /> is the object of my envy. I am reduced to French plays &amp; novels, Willis's
					mitred Abbies,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.771tm" /> &amp; the History of Norfolk<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.772tm" /> in 3 volumes Folio. these
					latter Authors have, I think, the most wit, tho' the others know rather more of the World.</p>
				<p>I wish the air of Hampstead were not so necessary to you all, but am glad you always know where to find health, &amp; that she<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.773tm" /> lives so near you. I continue better than has been usual for me in the summer, tho' I neither walk, nor take
					any thing: 'tis in mind only, that I am weary &amp; disagreeable. Mrs R:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.774tm" /> is declining every day, her
					stomach gone, very weak, sometimes giddy, &amp; subject to disorders in her bowels: yet I do not apprehend any immediate danger, but
					believe she will be reduced to keep her bed entirely.</p>
				<p>My best compliments to Mrs Wharton. pray let me hear from you as often as you are in a humour for writing, tho' from hence I can
					requite your kindness with so little to amuse you.</p>

				<p>I do not know how to make you amends, having neither rock, ruin, or precipice near me to send you; they do not grow in the south: but
					only say the word, if you would have a compact neat box of red brick with sash windows, or a grotto made of flints and shell-work, or a
					wallnut-tree with three mole-hills under it, stuck with honeysuckles round a bason of gold-fishes, and you shall be satisfied; they

				</p>
				<p>In the meantime I congratulate you on your new acquaintance with the <hi rend="italic">savage,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">rude,</hi>
					and the <hi rend="italic">tremendous.</hi> Pray, tell me, is it anything like what you had read in your book, or seen in two-shilling
					prints? Do not you think a man may be the wiser (I had almost said the better) for going a hundred or two of miles; and that the mind
					has more room in it than most people seem to think, if you will but furnish the apartments? I almost envy your last month, being in a
					very insipid situation myself; and desire you would not fail to send me some furniture for my Gothic apartment, which is very cold at
					present. It will be the easier task, as you have nothing to do but transcribe your little red books, if they are not rubbed out; for I
					conclude you have not trusted everything to memory,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.778tm" /> which is ten times worse than a lead pencil: Half
					a word fixed upon or near the spot, is worth a cart-load of recollection. When we trust to the picture that objects draw of themselves
					on our mind, we deceive ourselves; without accurate and particular observation, it is but ill-drawn at first, the outlines are soon
					blurred, the colours every day grow fainter; and at last, when we would produce it to any body, we are forced to supply its defects
					with a few strokes of our own imagination. God forgive me, I suppose I have done so myself before now, and misled many a good body that
					put their trust in me. Pray, tell me, (but with permission, and without any breach of hospitality), is it so much warmer on the other
					side of the Swale<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.779tm" /> (as some people of honour say) than it is here? Has the singing of birds, the
					bleating of sheep, the lowing of herds, deafened you at Rainton?<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.780tm" /> Did the vast old oaks and thick
					groves of Northumberland keep off the sun too much from you? I am too civil to extend my enquiries beyond Berwick. Every thing,
					doubtless, must improve upon you as you advanced northward. You must tell me, though, about Melross, Rosslin Chapel, and
						Arbroath.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.781tm" /> In short, your Port-feuille must be so full, that I only desire a loose chapter or two, and
					will wait for the rest till it comes out.</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Having been for a considerable time without any news of you, I have taken it into my head, that you are ill, or that Mrs Wharton is
					so. you will not wonder, if I grow a little superstitious, when you know, that I have not been a step out of the house for this
					fortnight or more past, for Mrs Rogers has been at the point of death with a disorder in her stomach accompanied with continual &amp;
					laborious reachings, &amp; a total loss of appetite, that has reduced her to the weakness of an infant, I mean, her body, tho' her
					senses are still perfect, &amp; (what I think remarkable) she has recover'd the use of her speech (wch for several years had been
					hardly intelligible) &amp; pronounces almost as plain, as ever she did. she is now for three days past, such is the strength of her
					constitution, in a way of recovery: medecine has had nothing to do in it, for she will take nothing prescribed her. when I say
					recovery, I do not mean, that she will ever recover her strength again, but, I think, she may live a good while in this helpless state;
					however it is very precarious, &amp; Dr Hayes<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.797tm" /> believes her quite worn out. I certainly do not put on
					(to you) more tenderness, than I really feel on this occasion, but the approaches of death are always a melancholy object, &amp; common
					humanity must suffer something from such a spectacle </p>
				<p>It is an age, since I heard any thing from Mason. if I do not mistake, this should be his month of waiting,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.798tm" /> unless he has exchanged his turn with some body: if he be in Town, you must probably have heard of him,
					&amp; can give me some intelligence. my old new acquaintance Lady Denbigh<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.799tm" /> is here at
						Stokehouse;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.800tm" /> but I do not believe, I shall be able to get out, or have any opportunity of seeing her,
					while she stays.</p>
				<p>If my fancies (wch I hope in God are mere fancies) should prove true, I hope you will let somebody tell me, how you do. if not, I
					shall beg you to tell me yourself, as soon as possible, &amp; set my understanding to rights.</p>

				<p>You will not imagine me the less grateful for the long letter you were so good to write me some time since, because I have omitted to
					answer it, especially if you know what has since happened. Mrs. Rogers died in the end of September; and what with going to town to
					prove her will<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.802tm" /> and other necessary things, what with returning back hither<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.803tm" /> to pay debts, make inventories, and other such delightful amusements, I have really been almost wholly taken
					up. I might perhaps make a merit even of writing now, if you could form a just idea of my situation, being joint executor with another
						aunt,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.804tm" /> who is of a mixed breed between &#x2014; and the Dragon of Wantley.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.805tm" /> So much for her. I next proceed to tell you that I saw Mason in town, who stayed there a day on my account,
					and then set out (not in a huff) with a laudable resolution to pass his winter at Aston, and save a curate.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.806tm" /> My Lord<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.807tm" /> has said something to him, which I am glad of, that looked like an
					excuse for his own dilatoriness in preferring him; but this is a secret. He told me he had seen you, and that you were well. Dr.
					Wharton continues dispirited, but a little better than he was. The first act of Caractacus is just arrived here, but I have not read it
					over.</p>
				<p>I am very disagreeable; but who can help that?</p>

				<p>My judgement is, that if your picture possess but any one of the beauties you see &amp; describe in it, it must be certainly worth
					eight or ten times as much as you gave for it. I only wonder, you should forget to say by what lucky chance you came by it. Old <hi
						rend="italic">Frank</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.812tm" /> was a Dutch Master of some note: the history of that School I am very little acquainted with, but if
					I am not mistaken, there was lately publish'd a French account of their lives<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.813tm" /> in two or more Volumes,
					4to, wch I have seen at Nourse's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.814tm" /> in wch you may meet with better information.</p>
				<p>I am agreeably employ'd here in dividing <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> with an old <hi rend="italic">Harridan,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.815tm" /> who is the spawn of Cerberus &amp; the Dragon of Wantley. When I shall get to Town I can not divine,
					but doubtless it will be between this &amp; Christmas. you were so good to offer me house-room for some of my lumber: I am therefore
					packing up certain boxes &amp; baskets, wch I believe you will be troubled with. but I beg Mrs Wharton to consider well first, whether
					it will be inconvenient to her. if she assures me, it will not, I shall inform you shortly of their shapes &amp; numbers. at present it
					seems to me, that there will be 3 or 4 large boxes; &amp; five baskets of China: the rest Madam Foster<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.816tm" />
					shall accommodate.</p>
				<p>Ah poor King of Prussia! what will become of him? I am told here, that matters are much worse, than is yet avowed.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.817tm" /> I also hear that seven Generals have refused the command, wch Hopson<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.818tm" /> is now
					gone with, who has been before censured for ill conduct, &amp; is besides so infirm, that he will not live the voyage.</p>

				<p>I should have told you, that Caradoc came safe to hand,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.820tm" /> but my critical faculties have been so taken

					composed enough for a better &amp; more tranquil employment: shortly however I will make them obey me; but am I to send this copy to Mr
					Hurd, or return it to you? methinks I do not love this travelling to &amp; again of manuscripts by the Post. while I am writing, your
					second packet is just arrived. I can only tell you in gross, that there seem to me certain passages alter'd wch might as well have been
					let alone; &amp; that I shall not be easily reconciled to Mador's <hi rend="italic">own</hi> song.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.822tm" /> I
					must not have my fancy raised to that agreeable pitch of heathenism, &amp; wild magical enthusiasm, &amp; then have you let me drop
					into moral philosophy, &amp; cold good sense. I remember you insulted me, when I saw you last, &amp; affected to call, that wch
					delighted my imagination, <hi rend="italic">Nonsense</hi>: now I insist, that Sense is nothing in poetry, but according to the dress
					she wears, &amp; the scene she appears in. if you should lead me into a superb Gothic building with a thousand cluster'd pillars, each
					of them half a mile high, the walls all cover'd with fretwork, &amp; the windows full of red &amp; blue Saints, that had neither head,
					nor tail; and I should find the Venus of Medici in person perk'd up in a long nich over the high altar, as naked as ever she was born,
					do you think it would raise, or damp my devotions? I say, that Mador must be entirely a Briton, &amp; that his preeminence among his
					companions must be shewn by superior wildness, more barbaric fancy, &amp; a more striking &amp; deeper harmony both of words &amp;
					numbers. if British antiquity be too narrow, this is the place for Invention, &amp; if it be pure invention, so much the clearer must
					the expression be, &amp; so much the stronger &amp; richer the imagery. there's for you now. </p>
				<p>I am sorry to hear you complain of your eyes. have a care of candle-light, &amp; rather play at hot-cockles<anchor

					<salute>Dear Mr Gray </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I recd your last. but as I had before sent you my 2d Ode I was in hopes to have heard again, with your particular remarks on that.
					Observe the 2d Stanza, that is the 1st Antistrophe, I intend to alter on acct of the sameness of imagery with one in
						Melancholly,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.835tm" /> but I hope the rest will stand some words excepted, I will attempt a new Madors song to
					please you. but in my own mind, I would not have him sing there at all, on account of the toute ensemble<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.836tm"
					 /> for he sings all the 2d Ode &amp; also all the fourth. so Im afraid he'll be hoarse. I like the Idea of my fourth Ode much &amp;
					the preparation to it. tis the speech of an armed Death to the Britons. Who Mador is supposd to see &amp; hear just at the onset of the
					Battle.</p>
				<p>Thus. <q>
						<p>CHORUS. </p>
						<p>&#x2014; but why is this <lb /> Why doth our Brother Mador snatch his Harp <lb /> From yonder Bough? Why this way bend his steps </p>
						<p>CARACT: </p>
						<p>He looks entranced. The Fillet bursts that bound <lb /> His liberal locks. His snowy vestments fall <lb /> In ampler folds, &amp;
							all his floating form <lb /> Doth seem to glisten with Divinity. <lb /> Yet is he speechless. Say thou chief of bards <lb /> What is
							there in this airy Vacancy <lb /> That thou with fiery &amp; irregular glance <lb /> Should scan thus wildly? Wherefore heaves thy
							Breast? <lb /> Why starts&#x2014; </p>
						<p>ODE </p>
						<p>Hark! heard ye not yon footstep dread, <lb /> That shook the Earth with Thundring tread? <lb /> Twas Death. in Haste <lb /> The
							Warrior past, <lb /> High towerd his Helmed head. <lb /> I markt his mail, I markd his Shield, <lb /> I spyd the spar[k]ling of his
							spear, <lb /> I saw his giant Arm the Falcion wield <lb /> Courage was in his van &amp; conquest in his rear. </p>
					</q> and so it goes on but without a word of Odin &amp; Valhalla. yet the general Celtic principle of the happiness of dying in Battle
					is touchd upon wch I hope is not in itself too Scaldic. </p>
				<p>I send you with this another pacquet &amp; I have another ready to follow it then I get to my third Ode &amp; when that is done I
					shall have little more than transcription. When you have all the MS. I would have you keep it, till I write about sending it to Mr
					Hurd. probably we may contrive it without posting. Do excuse all this <hi rend="italic">Caractication</hi> I am seriously desirous of
					getting quit of him &amp; therefore must trouble you till I do.</p>
				<p>Mr Brown has writ me a long Letter about keeping my Divinity act,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.837tm" /> wch he says I must do next March.

					if the matted things fright you on the same account, the coverings may be taken off, &amp; laid by in some dry place. I like mightily
					your proposal of insuring; but I thought, they would not do it for China, Glasses, or Linnen. the value (including Mrs Forster's
					parcels) I should set at about 250£. I could not perhaps sell the contents for so much, but it is certain, that I could never buy them
					for that money. if it could be done immediately, I should be glad (supposing it be not any great trouble) tho' in about ten days I
					shall be in Town myself. will you let your Servant enquire, if my old lodgeings<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.859tm" /> will be vacant at that
					time?</p>
				<p>It may be necessary to add a list of the remaining parcels, supposing you should think it right to insure all together. At Mrs
					Forster's <list>

					<salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>You will think me either dead, or in that happy state (wch is that of most People alive) of forgetting every thing they ought to
					remember: yet I am neither one, nor the other. I am now in Town, having taken leave of Stoke, &amp; hoping to take leave of my other
						incumbrances<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.874tm" /> in a few months time. I send you in short my opinion of Caractacus,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.875tm" /> so far (I mean) as I have seen of it. I shall only tell you farther, that I am charmed with the Idea you
					give me of your 4th Ode. it is excellently introduced, &amp; the specimen, you send me, even sublime. I am <hi rend="italic"
						>wrap'd</hi> in it; but the last line of the Stanza falls off, &amp; must be changed, <hi rend="italic">Courage was in his van,</hi>
					&amp;c: for it is <hi rend="italic">ordinary,</hi> when compared with the rest. to be sure the immortality of ye Soul, &amp; the
					happiness of dieing in battle are Druid doctrines:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.876tm" /> you may dress them at pleasure, so they do but look
					wild &amp; British.</p>
				<p>I have little to say from hence but that Cleone<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.877tm" /> has succeeded very well at Covent-Garden, &amp; that
					People, who despised it in Manuscript, went to see it &amp; confess, they cried. so for fear of crying too I did not go.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.878tm" /> poor Smart<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.879tm" /> is not dead, as was said, &amp; Merope<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.880tm" /> is acted for his benefit this week with a new Farce, the Guardian.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.881tm" /> here is
					a very agreeable Opera of Cocchi's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.882tm" /> the Cyrus,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.883tm" /> wch gave me some
					pleasure. do you know, I like both Whithed's Odes<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.884tm" /> in great measure, but no body else does.</p>
				<p>I hear matters will be made up with the Dutch,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.885tm" /> &amp; there will be no war. the K: of Portugal<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.886tm" /> has slily introduced troops into Lisbon under pretence of clearing away the rubbish,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.887tm" /> &amp; seized the unsuspecting Conspirators<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.888tm" /> in their own houses. they are
					Men of principal note, in particular the family of <hi rend="italic">Tavora,</hi> who have some pretentions to ye Crown; &amp; it is
					thought the Jesuits have made use of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> ambition to execute their own revenge.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.889tm"
					 /> the story of ye King's gallantries, &amp; the jealousy of some Man of Quality, who contrived the assassination, is said to be all
						false.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.890tm" /> Adieu! I rejoice to hear you use your eyes again. write to me at Dr Wharton's, for perhaps I may go to Cambridge for some
						weeks, &amp; he will take care I shall have your letter. </p>

				<postscript>
					<p>P: 2. I liked the opening,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.892tm" /> as it was originally, better than I do now. tho' I never throughly
						understood how <hi rend="italic">blank</hi> he frowns. &amp; as to <hi rend="italic">black</hi> stream, it gives me the Idea of a
						river of mud: I should read, <hi rend="italic">dark</hi> stream, imagining it takes its hue only from the rocks &amp; trees, that
						overhang it. <hi rend="italic">these cliffs, these yawning</hi> &amp;c: comes in very well, where it stood at first, &amp; you have
						only reserved it to another place, where by being somewhat more diffused, it appears weaker. you have introduced no new image in your
						new beginning, but one, <hi rend="italic">utters deep wailings,</hi> which is very well; but as to a trickling <hi rend="italic"
							>runlet</hi> I never heard of such a thing, unless it were a runlet of brandy.</p>
					<p>Yet I have no objection at all to the reflection Didius makes on the power objects of ye sight have over ye soul: it is in its
						place, &amp; might be even longer, but then it should be more choicely &amp; more feelingly express'd. he must not talk of <hi
							rend="italic">dells</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">streams</hi> only, but of something more striking &amp; more corresponding to the
						scene before him. <hi rend="italic">intellect</hi> is a word of Science, &amp; therefore inferior to any more common word.</p>
					<p>P: 3. For the same reason I reject <hi rend="italic">Philosophy,</hi> &amp; read <q><p>Studious they measure: save when
								Contemplation &amp;c: </p></q> &amp; here you omitt two lines, relating to Astronomy, for no cause that I discern. </p>
					<p>P: 4. What is your quarrel to <hi rend="italic">Shallops</hi>? I like <hi rend="italic">go bid thine Eagles soar,</hi> perhaps from
						obstinacy, for I know you have met with some wise Gentleman, who says it is a false thought, &amp; informs you that these were not
						real Eagles, but made of metal or wood painted.</p>
					<p>The word <hi rend="italic">Seers</hi> comes over too often, &amp; here besides it sounds ill. Elidurus need not be so fierce. <hi
							rend="italic">dost thou insult us, Roman,</hi> was better before.</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="italic">Sure-plan'd</hi> is a nasty stiff word.</p>
					<p>P: 6. It must be <hi rend="italic">Cæsar &amp; Fate.</hi> the name of Claudius carries contempt with it.</p>
					<p>P: 7. Brother, I <hi rend="italic">spurn</hi> it. better, than I <hi rend="italic">scorn</hi> it.</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="italic">Misjudging</hi> Boy is weakly. he calls him <hi rend="italic">Coward,</hi> because such a reproach was the most
						likely to sting him. <hi rend="italic">I'll do the deed</hi> myself is bolder, more resolute, more hasty, than the alteration.</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="italic">Lead forth the saintly</hi> &amp;c: better, shorter, &amp; more lively at first. what have I to do with <hi
							rend="italic">purple</hi> robes &amp; <hi rend="italic">arraignments,</hi> like a tryal at York-Assizes?</p>
					<p>P: 8. Try, if '<hi rend="italic">twill bring</hi> her deluging &amp;c: better so: only I do not like <hi rend="italic">strait</hi>
						Justice. modest <hi rend="italic">mounds</hi> is far worse.</p>
					<p>P: 9. Do <hi rend="italic">this &amp; prosper.</hi> but pray thee &amp;c: oh! how much superior to the cold lines, for wch you would
						omitt them. it is not <hi rend="italic">You,</hi> but somebody else, that has been busy both here &amp; elsewhere.</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="italic">Come</hi> from their caves. I read <q><p>Are issuing from their Caves. hear'st thou yon signal?</p></q> &amp; put
							<hi rend="italic">aweful,</hi> where it was before.</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="italic">I'll wait the closing</hi> &amp;c: leave it, as it was. <hi rend="italic">Do thou, as likes thee best. betray, or
							aid me.</hi> it is shorter &amp; more <hi rend="italic">sulky.</hi> Elidurus too must not go off in silence, &amp; what can he say
						better?</p>
					<p>P: 10. I do not dislike the Idea of this Ceremony, but the execution of it is careless &amp; hasty. the reply of the Semichorus is
						stolen from Dryden's Oedipus, wch perhaps you never saw nor I, since I was a Boy, at wch time it left an impression on my fancy. pray
						look at it. this <hi rend="italic">dread ground</hi> breaks my teeth. Be it <hi rend="italic">Worm</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aske</hi>
						or <hi rend="italic">Toad.</hi> these are things for Fairies to make war upon, but not Druids: at least they must not name them. an
							<hi rend="italic">Aske</hi> is somewhat I never heard of.</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="italic">Full five Fathom under ground.</hi> consider five fathom is but 30 feet. many a Cellar lies deeper.</p>
					<p>I read <hi rend="italic">Gender'd by</hi> the autumnal moon. by its light I mean. <hi rend="italic">conjoin</hi> is a bad word. <hi
							rend="italic">supernal art profound</hi> is negligent. indeed I do not understand the image; how the snakes in copulation should <hi
							rend="italic">heave</hi> their egg to <hi rend="italic">ye sky</hi>: you will say, it is an old British fancy.<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg2a.893tm" /> I know it of old; but then it must be made picturesque, &amp; look almost as if it were true.</p>
					<p>P: 13. Befit such <hi rend="italic">station</hi>: the verse wants a syllable.</p>
					<p>Ev'n in the <hi rend="italic">breast</hi> of Mona. read the <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> of Mona.</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="italic">Catches fresh grace.</hi> the Simile is good, but not this expression. the Tower is more majestic, more venerable,
						not more <hi rend="italic">graceful.</hi> I read &#x2013;</p>
					<q>
						<p>He looks, as doth the Tower <lb /> After the conflict of Heav'n's angry bolts: <lb /> Its nodding walls, its shatter'd battlements
							<lb /> Frown with a dignity unmark'd before <lb /> Ev'n in its prime of strength&#x2014; </p>
					</q>
					<p>P: 13. I do not desire, he should return the Druid's salute so politely. let him enter with that reflection, <hi rend="italic">This
							holy place</hi> &amp;c: &amp; not stand upon ceremony. it required no alteration, only I hate the word vegetate, &amp; would read</p>
					<q>
						<p>&#x2014;tell me, Druid, <lb /> Is it not better to be such, as these, <lb /> Than be the thing I am? </p>
					</q>
					<p>I read too Nor <hi rend="italic">shew a Prætor's</hi> edict &amp;c: &amp; <hi rend="italic">pestilent glare,</hi> as they were
						before. add too <q><p>See to the altar's base <hi rend="italic">the Victims</hi> led &amp;c:</p></q> and then, whether they were Bulls
						or Men, it is all one. I must repeat again, that the word <hi rend="italic">Seers</hi> is repeated for ever.</p>
					<p>P: 17. <hi rend="italic">I know it, rev'rend Fathers,</hi> &amp;c: this speech is sacred with me, &amp; an example of <hi
							rend="italic">dramatic</hi> poetry: touch not a hair of its head, as you love your honour.</p>
					<p>P: 18. I had rather some of these Personages, Resignation, Peace, Revenge, Slaughter, Ambition, were strip'd of their allegoric
						Garb: a little simplicity here in the expression would better prepare the high &amp; fantastic strain, &amp; all the unimaginable
						harpings, that follow. I admire all from <hi rend="italic">eager to snatch thee</hi> &amp;c: down to the first Epode of ye Chorus.</p>
					<p>you give these miltonic stanza's up so easily, that I begin to waver about Mador's song. if you have wrote it, &amp; it turn out the
						finest thing in the world, I rejoice &amp; say no more: let it come, tho' it were in the middle of a Sermon. but if not, I do confess
						at last, that the Chorus may break off, &amp; do very well without a word more. don't be angry at the trouble I have given you. and
						now I have found the reason, why I could not be pleased with Mador's philosophic song. the true Lyric style with all its flights of
						fancy, ornaments &amp; heightening of expression, &amp; harmony of sound, is in its nature superior to every other style. wch is just
						the cause, why it could not be born in a work of great length, no more than the eye could bear to see all this scene, that we
						constantly gaze upon, the verdure of the fields &amp; woods, the azure of the sea &amp; skies, turn'd into one dazzling expanse of
						gems. the Epic therefore assumed a style of graver colours, &amp; only stuck on a diamond (borrow'd from her Sister) here &amp; there,
						where it best became her. when we pass from the diction, that suits this kind of writing, to that wch belongs to the former: it
						appears natural, &amp; delights us. but to pass on a sudden from the lyric glare to the epic solemnity (if I may be allow'd to talk
						nonsense) has a very different effect: we seem to drop from verse into mere prose, from light into darkness. another thing is, the
						pauses proper to one, &amp; the other, are not at all the same; the ear therefore loses by the change. do you think, if
							Mingotti<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.894tm" /> stop'd in the middle of her best air, &amp; only repeated the remaining verses, (tho' the
						best Metastasio ever wrote,) that they would not appear very cold to you, &amp; very heavy?</p>
					<p>P: 24. <hi rend="italic">Boldly</hi> dare, is tautology.</p>
					<p>P: 27. <hi rend="italic">Brigantum.</hi> there was no such place.</p>
					<p>P: 28. The sacred <hi rend="italic">Hares.</hi> you might as well say, the sacred <hi rend="italic">Hogs.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>P: 29. There is an affectation in so often using the old phrase of <hi rend="italic">Or e'er</hi> for <hi rend="italic">before.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>P: 30. <hi rend="italic">Rack</hi> is the course of ye clouds. <hi rend="italic">wreck</hi> is ruin &amp; destruction. wch do you
						mean?</p>
					<p>I am not yet entirely satisfied with the conclusion of this fine Allegory. <hi rend="italic">that blest prize redeem'd</hi> is
						flatly express'd, &amp; her <hi rend="italic">sticking the pages</hi> over the arch of her bower is an Idea a little burlesque.
						besides are we sure the whole is not rather too long for the place it is in, where all the interests of the scene stand still for it?
						&amp; this is still drawn out farther by the lines you have here put into the mouth of Caractacus. do not mistake me, I admire part of
						it, &amp; approve almost all, but consider the time &amp; place.</p>
					<p>P: 31. <hi rend="italic">Pensive Pilgrim.</hi> why not? there is an impropriety in <hi rend="italic">wakeful Wanderer.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>I have told you my thoughts of this Chorus already. the whole scheme is excellent, the 2d Strophe &amp; Antistrophe divine. money (I
						know) is your motive,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.895tm" /> &amp; of that I wash my hands. fame is your second consideration; of that I am
						not the dispenser. but if your own approbation (for every one is a little conscious of his own talents) &amp; mine, have any weight
						with you, you will write an Ode or two every year, till you are turn'd of fifty, not for the World, but for us two only. we will now
						&amp; then give a little glimpse of them, but no copies.</p>
					<p>P: 37. I do not like <hi rend="italic">Maidenhood.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>38. Why not <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> in vain, as before? the word <hi rend="italic">meek</hi> is too often repeated.</p>
					<p>P: 42. The only reason why you have alter'd my favourite speech is, that <hi rend="italic">surging &amp; plunging, main &amp;
							domain</hi> come too near each other. but could not you correct these without spoiling all? I read <q>
							<p>Cast his broad eye upon the wild of Ocean, <lb /> And calm'd it with a glance: then plunging deep <lb /> His mighty arm, pluck'd
								from its dark domain &amp;c: </p>
						</q> pray, have done with your <hi rend="italic">piled stores &amp; coral floors.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>43. the <hi rend="italic">Dies</hi> of Fate, that is, the <hi rend="italic">Dice</hi> of Fate. find out another word.</p>
					<p>44. I can not say I think this scene improved. I had no objection before, but to, <hi rend="italic">harm a poor wretch, like
						me</hi>; &amp; what you have inserted is (to me) inferior to what it was meant to replace, except p: 47. <hi rend="italic">And why
							this silence,</hi> wch is very well. the end of ye scene is one of my favourite passages.</p>
					<p>49. Why scratch out, Thou, <hi rend="italic">gallant Boy</hi>?</p>
					<p>I do not know to what other scene you have transfer'd these rites of lustration, but methinks they did very well here. Arviragus's
						account of himself I always was highly pleased with. </p>
					<p>51. <hi rend="italic">Fervid</hi> is a bad word.</p>

				<p>I cannot help sending you a line to desire that if you can spare a moment from buying &amp; selling of South sea annuities, taking
					inventorys of Old China jars &amp; three legd stools with black feet &amp; grass-green velvit bottoms, you would write me word how you
					do. I ask not criticisms, nor hints, nor emendations these at your leisure, for my tythes are come in, I live within tolerable compass
					&amp; therefore I care not a fig whether Caractacus goes forth or no, evn tho he should bring me as much as Cleone<anchor

					wch a thank severally, &amp; ten a peice for evry emendation, that is to say evry alteration. Yet I can't help thinking that if you had
					not seen the joint critique<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.911tm" /> from Prior park,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.912tm" /> you would not have judgd
					so hardly of some of my new lines. True, I did not think evry thing that all my Criticks have remarkd necessary to be alterd, yet I
					alterd them for this reason, Criticks like Indians are proud of the number of scalps they make in a Manuscript, &amp; if you dont let
					them scalp theyll do you no service. However it appears I have Scalp'd myself in some places particularly at the beginning. Yet I
					cannot help thinking that <hi rend="italic">chills the pale plain beneath him</hi> is an improvement, yet I can unscalp if you bid me.
					there is one unfortunate thing wch attends shewing either a markd or an alterd Manuscript, &amp; you yourself prove it to me; The
					person that reads it regards only the marks &amp; alterations &amp; considers whether they are right or wrong, &amp; hence a number of
					faulty Passages in the gross escape his observation. I remember I shewd Caract: this summer to a certain Critick who read it all over,
					&amp; returnd it me with this single Observation, "I have read it &amp; I think those faults wch are markd with a pencil ought to be
					alterd." I was surprizd at this because I did not know the Ms was markd at all at that time. I examind it &amp; found here &amp; there
					about 7 or eight almost invisible little X X. I could not conceive who had done it; I askd Delap<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.913tm" /> if he
					had, &amp; he cryd peccavi, assuring me he only did it to remember to tell me of some minutiæ wch he thought inaccurate, but that he
					thought he had almost made them invisible. so quicksighted is the Eye of a Critic!</p>
				<p>But to proceed &#x2013; I agree to allmost all your Criticisms; however they make against me, your absolution from Madors song makes
					amends for all. Yet I am sorry about the scene between Evelina &amp; Elidurus tis what the generality will think the principal scene,
					&amp; wch yet is not as it should be. I am afraid of making it more pathetic &amp; yet if it is not so it will not satisfy. I send you
					with this my third Ode you will find it must be inserted soon after the discription of the Rocking Stone, &amp; the last line of the
					sheet I send you will connect with this <q><p>So certain that in our absolving tongues.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.914tm" /></p></q> So
					that a few lines must be cancelld in the copy you have. my reason for this change is that <hi rend="italic">I myself I</hi> thought
					(&amp; no body else) that a Lustration Ode would take up too much time in the place first intended &amp; that the action went on too
					slow there. I shall therefore shew more of Caractacus himself in the scene subsequent to the next I shall send you; &amp; I am pretty
					sure that (toute ensembles considerd) this will be an improvement. As to this Ode, I do not expect you to like it so well as you do the
					2d, yet I hope 'tis well enough, &amp; will have some effect in the place it comes in. Explicit pars Poesi<hi rend="italic">ω</hi>s
					&amp; incipit Pars Chitchatices. I dare not face Rutherforth<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.915tm" /> that saintly Butcher in his purple Robes
					of Divinity, &amp; therefore, sorely against good Mr Brown's Gizzard, I have given up my fellowship &amp; this post carries my
					civilities to Dr Long concerning this great resignation. Indeed if I could dispute Black into white like my Uncle Balguy<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.916tm" /> this act<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.917tm" /> would have fallen out too unluckily for me to have thought of
					keeping it, for I am resolvd not to set my face southward these several Months, not evn if I publish this spring. For Ill either have
					the sheets sent down to me, or get somebody in town to correct the press, do you think either Dr Wharton or Stonehewer could be
					prevaild on to take this trouble. You are perpetually twitting me about my motive of Gain,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.918tm" /> could I
					write half as well as Rousseau I would prove to you that this is the only motive any reasonable Man should have in this matter, but
					pray distinguish the matter I mean Gain is not my only motive for writing, God forbid it should; I write for Fame, for Posterity, &amp;
					all sort of fine things. But Gain is my only motive for Publishing for I publish to the present Age, whom I would fleece if I could
					like any Cossack Calmuck or Carcolspack.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.919tm" /> Now do you understand me, &amp; if you do, don't you agree
					with me?</p>
				<p>This resuscitation of Poor Smart<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.920tm" /> pains me, I was in hopes he was safe in that state where the best
					of us will be better than we are &amp; the worst I hope as little worse as infinite Justice can permit. But is he returnd to his
					senses? if so I fear that will be more terrible still, pray, if you can dispose of a Guinea so as it will in any sort benefit him (for
					tis too late for a ticket)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.921tm" /> give it for me. My best regard to Dr Wharton and Mrs if this finds you
					there.</p>
				<p>You will find from my last letter that Hurd is disposd to gratify the Drs Humanity.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.922tm" /> Have you seen

				<p>The inclosed which I have this minute received from Mr Bentley, explains much that I had to say to you &#x2013; yet I have a question
					or two more.</p>
				<p>Who &amp; what sort of Man is a Mr Sharp<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.929tm" /> of Bennet? I have received a most obliging &amp; genteel
						letter<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.930tm" /> from him, with the very letter of Edw. 6th which you was so good as to send me. I have
					answered his, but shoud like to know a little more about him. Pray thank the Dean of Lincoln too for me; I am much obliged to him for
					his offer, but had rather draw upon his <hi rend="italic">Lincolnship</hi> than his <hi rend="italic">Cambridgehood.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.931tm" /> In the library of the former are some original letters of Tiptoft,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.932tm" />
					as you will find in my Catalogue. When Dr. Greene is there, I shall be glad if he will let me have them copied.</p>
				<p>I will thank you if you will look in some provincial history of Ireland for Odo (Hugh) Oneil King of Ulster;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.933tm" /> when did he live? I have got a most curious Seal of his, &amp; know no more of him than of Ouacraw King of
					the Paw-waws.</p>
				<p>I wanted to ask you whether you or anybody that you beleive in, beleive in the Q. of Scots' letter to Q. Elizabeth &#x2013; If it is
					genuine, I dont wonder she cut her head off &#x2013; but I think it must be some forgery that was not made use of.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.934tm" /></p>
				<p>Now to my distress &#x2013; you must have seen an Advertisement, perhaps the book itself, the villainous book itself, that has been
					published to defend me against the Critical Review.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.935tm" /> I have been childishly unhappy about it, &amp; had
					drawn up a protestation or Affidavit of my knowing nothing of it, but my friends woud not let me publish it. I sent to the printer who
					woud not discover the Author &#x2013; nor coud I guess. They tell me nobody can suspect my being privy to it, but there is an Intimacy
					affected that I think will deceive many &#x2013; &amp; yet I must be the most arrogant fool living if I coud know &amp; suffer anybody
					to speak of me in that Style &#x2013; For God's sake do all you can for me, and publish my Abhorrence. Today I am told that it is that
					puppy Dr Hill,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.936tm" /> who has chosen to make war with the Magazines thro my Sides. I coud pardon him any

				<p>Did I tell you I had been confined in Town with the Gout for a fortnight? well, &amp; since I came hither,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.939tm" /> it is come again. yesterday I came abroad again for the first time in a great shoe, &amp; very much out of
					humour; and so I must return again in three days to town about <hi rend="italic">business,</hi> wch is not like to add much to the
					sweetness of my temper, especially while Stocks are so low.</p>
				<p>I did not remember ever to have seen the joint-criticism from Prior-park, that you speak of; so little impression did it make: nor
					should I believe now, that I had ever seen it, did I not recollect, what a prejudice the Parsons<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.940tm" />
					express'd to human sacrifice, wch is quite agreeable to my way of thinking, since Caractacus convinced me of the propriety of the
					thing. it is certain, that their fancies did in no sort influence me in the use of my Tomahawk. now you must know, I do not much admire
					the Chorus of ye <hi rend="italic">rocking-stone,</hi> nor yet much disapprove it. it is grave &amp; solemn and may pass. I insist
					however, that <hi rend="italic">deigns</hi> (tho' it be a rhyme) should be <hi rend="italic">deign'st,</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic"
						>fills fill'st,</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">bids bid'st.</hi> do not blame me, but the English Tongue. the beginning of the

							<hi rend="italic">mæandring</hi> way,<lb /> Where <hi rend="italic">Vice</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Folly</hi> stray.</p></q> nor
					the word <hi rend="italic">sprite.</hi> the beginning too of ye Epode is well, but you have used the epithet <hi rend="italic"
						>pale</hi> before in a sense somewhat similar &amp; I do not love repetitions. the line <hi rend="italic">Or magic numbers</hi>
					interrupts the run of ye Stanza, &amp; lets the measure drop too short. there is no beauty in repeating <hi rend="italic">ponderous
						sphere.</hi> the two last lines are the best.</p>
				<p>The sense of your simile about the distant thunder is not clear, nor well-expressed: besides it implies too strong a confession of
					guilt.</p>
				<p>The Stanza you sent me for ye 2d Ode<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.941tm" /> is very rude, &amp; neither the Idea, nor verses touch me much.
					it is not the Gout, that makes me thus difficult, finish but your <hi rend="italic">Death-Song</hi> as well as you imagined &amp; begun

				<p>This is the third return of the Gout in the space of three months, &amp; worse than either of the former. it is now in a manner over,
					&amp; I am so much the nearer being a Cripple, but not at all the richer. this is my excuse for long silence, &amp; if you had felt the
					pain, you would think it an excuse for a greater fault. I have been all the time of the fit here in Town, &amp; doubtless ought to have
					paid my court to you &amp; to Caractacus, but a Critick with the Gout is a Devil incarnate, &amp; you have had a happy escape. I can
					not repent (if I have really been any hindrance) that you did not publish this spring: I would have it mellow a little longer; &amp; do
					not think, it will lose any thing of its flavour. to comfort you for your loss, know, that I have lost above 200£ by selling
						stock.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.945tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I half envy your situation &amp; your improvements (tho' I do not know Mr Wood)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.946tm" /> yet am of your
					opinion as to prudence. the more so because Mr Bonfoy<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.947tm" /> tells me, he saw a letter from you to Lady
						H:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.948tm" /> &amp; that she express'd a sort of kindness; to wch My Lord added, that he should write a
					rattling epistle to you that was to fetch you out of the country. whether he has or not, don't much signify: I would come &amp; see
					them.</p>
				<p>I shall be here this month at least,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.949tm" /> against my will, unless you come. Stonhewer is here with all
					his Sisters, the youngest of wch has got a Husband. two matches more (but in a superior class) are going to be soon. Ld Weymouth<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.950tm" /> to the D: of Portland's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.951tm" /> homely Daughter, Lady Betty,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.952tm" /> with 35,000£; &amp; Lord Waldgrave<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.953tm" /> to Miss Maria Walpole<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.954tm" /> with 10,000£. it is impossible for two handsome<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.955tm" /> People ever to meet. all
					the cruelties of Portugal are certainly owing to an amour of the King's (of long standing) with the younger Marquiss of Tavora's Wife:
					the Jesuits made their advantage of the resentments of that Family.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.956tm" /> the disturbances at Lisbon are all
					false. this is my whole little stock of News. </p>
				<p>Here is a very pretty Opera, the Cyrus;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.957tm" /> &amp; here is the Musæum,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.958tm" />
					wch is indeed a treasure: the Trustees lay out 1400£ a-year, &amp; have but 900£ to spend. if you would see it, you must send a
					fortnight beforehand, it is so crowded. then here are Murden's Papers,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.959tm" /> &amp; Hume's History of ye
						Tudors,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.960tm" /> &amp; Robertson's History of Mary Stuart &amp; her Son;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.961tm" /> and

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I have at last found rest<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.992tm" /> for the sole of my gouty foot in your own old Dining-room,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.993tm" /> &amp; hope in spite of the damnation denounced by the Bishop's two Chaplains,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.994tm"
					 /> that you may find at least an equal satisfaction &amp; repose at Old-Park.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.995tm" /> if your Bog<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.996tm" /> prove as comfortable as my Oven,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.997tm" /> I shall see no occasion to pity you; &amp;
					only wish that you may <hi rend="italic">brew</hi> no worse, than I <hi rend="italic">bake.</hi> you totally mistake my talents, when
					you impute to me any magical skill in planting roses. I know, I am no Conjuror<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.998tm" /> in these things; when
					they are done, I can find fault, &amp; that is all. now this is the very reverse of Genius, &amp; I feel my own littleness. reasonable
					People know themselves better, than is commonly imagined; &amp; therefore (tho' I never saw any instance of it) I believe Mason, when
					he tells me he understands planting better, than anything whatever.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.999tm" /> the <hi rend="italic">prophetic
						eye of Taste</hi> (as Mr. Pitt<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1000tm" /> call'd it) sees all the beauties, that a Place is susceptible of,
					long before they are born; &amp; when it plants a seedling, already sits under the shadow of it, &amp; enjoys the effect it will have
					from every point of view, that lies in prospect. you must therefore invoke Caractacus, &amp; he will send his Spirits<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1001tm" /> from the top of Snowdon to Cross-Fell,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1002tm" /> or Warden-Law.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1003tm" />
				</p>
				<p>The Thermometer is in the Passage-Window (where the Sun never comes) near the head of the Back-Stairs. since you went, I have never
					observed it lower than 68, most part of the day at 74, &amp; yesterday at 5 in ye afternoon it was at 79, the highest I have ever seen
					it. it now is prepared to correspond regularly with you at the hours you mention. the Weather for this fortnight has been broiling
					without interruption, one thunder-shower excepted, wch did not cool the air at all. Rye (I am told) is begun to be cut near London. in
					Cambridgeshire a fortnight ago the promise of harvest was the finest I ever saw, but the Farmers complain (I hear) that the ears do not
					fill for want of wet: the Wheat was then turning yellow. Duke-Cherries<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1004tm" /> are over in London; 3 days ago
					they sold for half-a-crown a Pound. Caroons<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1005tm" /> &amp; Black-Hearts very large &amp; fine drive about the
					streets in wheel-barrows a penny a pound. Raspberries a few are yet remaining, but in a manner over. Melons are ripe, &amp; Apricots
					&amp; Orleans-Plums are to be seen in the fruitshops. Roses are (I think) over a week ago. the Jessamine (at Mrs Dod's on a S:W: Wall)
					was in full bloom (if you remember) long before you went from hence, &amp; so it continues. that below in the Garden on a N:E: Wall has
					been all this week cover'd with flowers. my nosegays from Covent-Garden consist of nothing but Scarlet-Martagons, Everlasting-Peas,
					Double-Stocks, Pinks, &amp; flowering Marjoram: as I have kept no exact account hitherto this year, I can say no more of July, that now
					is. therefore I shall annex one for the year 1754, wch I observed day by day at Stoke. observe, it had been then a cold rainy
						Summer.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1006tm" />
				</p>
				<p>The heat was very moderate this month, &amp; a great deal of rain fell. the sown Hay was all got in by the first day, but the
					meadow-hay was not before ye 23d. it was very good &amp; in plenty, but sold at 40 shillings a load in the field on account of the
					scarcity the year preceding. Barley was in ear on the first day; grey and white Peas in bloom. the Bean flowers were going off.
					Duke-Cherries in plenty on the 5th; Hearts were also ripe. green Melons on the 6th, but watry, &amp; not sweet. Currants begun to ripen
					on the 8th, &amp; red Goose-berries had changed colour; Tares were then in flower, &amp; Meadow-Hay cutting. Lime-trees in full bloom
					on the 9th. Mushrooms in perfection on the 17th. Wheat &amp; Oats had changed colour, &amp; Buck-Wheat was in bloom on the 19th. the
					Vine had then open'd its blossoms, &amp; the end of ye month Grapes were near ye size of small Pease. Turneps appear'd above ground on
					the 22d; &amp; Potatoes were in flower. Barley had changed its hue, &amp; Rye was almost ripe on the 23d. The Pine-apple-Strawberry was
					then in perfection. Black Caroons were ripe, &amp; some Duke-Cherries still remain'd on walls the 26th, but the Hearts were then all
					spoil'd by the rain. Gooseberries red &amp; white were then ripe, &amp; Currants in abundance. </p>

					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>The season for triumph is at last come; I mean for our Allies, for it will be long enough before we shall have reason to exult in any
					great actions of our own, &amp; therefore, as usual, we are proud for our neigbours. Contades' great army is entirely defeated:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1041tm" /> this (I am told) is undoubted, but no particulars<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1042tm" /> are known as yet; &amp;
					almost as few of the other victory over ye Russians,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1043tm" /> wch is lost in the splendor of this greater
					action. so much for war, &amp; now come and see me in my peaceful new settlement, from whence I have the command of Highgate,
					Hampstead, Bedford-Gardens, &amp; the Musæum. this last (as you will imagine) is my favourite Domain, where I often pass four hours in
					the day in the stillness &amp; solitude of the reading room, wch is uninterrupted by any thing but Dr Stukeley<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1044tm" /> the Antiquary, who comes there to talk nonsense, &amp; Coffee-house news. the rest of the Learned are (I
					suppose) in the country; at least none of them come there, except two Prussians, &amp; a Man, who writes for Ld Royston.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1045tm" /> when I call it peaceful, you are to understand it only of us Visiters, for the Society itself, Trustees,
					&amp; all, are up in arms, like the Fellows of a College. the Keepers have broke off all intercourse with one another, &amp; only lower
					a silent defiance, as they pass by. Dr Knight<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1046tm" /> has wall'd up the passage to the little-House,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1047tm" /> because some of the rest were obliged to pass by one of his windows in the way to it. moreover the trustees
					lay out 500£ a year more than their income; so you may expect, all the books &amp; the crocodiles will soon be put up to auction. the
					University (we hope) will buy.</p>
				<p>I have not (as you silently charge me) forgot Mosheim.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1048tm" /> I enquired long ago &amp; was told there
					were none in England, but Nourse<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1049tm" /> expects a cargo every day, &amp; as soon as it comes, you shall have
					it. Mason never writes; but I hear, he is well, from Dr Gisbourne.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1050tm" /> do not pout, but pray let me hear
					from you, &amp; above all do, come &amp; see me, for I assure you, I am not uncomfortably situated for a Lodger, &amp; what are we, but

				<p>I retract a part of my yesterday's intelligence, having to day<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1053tm" /> had an opportunity of hearing more,
					&amp; from the best hand.</p>
				<p>The merit of Prince Ferdinand's policy &amp; conduct is not a little abated by this account.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1054tm" /> he had
					made a detachment of 4 or 5000 Men under the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1055tm" /> wch had got between the
					main French army, &amp; the town of Herwart, where their principal Magazine lay. the fear they were under on that account obliged
					Contades to begin the attack, &amp; he accordingly begun his march at midnight in eight columns. very early in the morning, before the
					Prince had time to make the proper dispositions, they were upon him. he had only his first line formed, when the Battle begun; &amp; of
					that line the English Infantry made a considerable part. Contade's troops (join'd by the Duke of Broglio's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1056tm" /> Corps) amounted to near four-score thousand: the Prince had only 40 Battalions with him, half of wch only
					engaged (as I said) for want of time. the French Artillery at first did terrible execution, &amp; it was then our four Regiments
					suffer'd so much, 68 of their Officers (all, I think, below a Captain in degree) being kill'd or wounded, 267 private Men kill'd, &amp;
					above 900 wounded. the rest of the line were Hanoverians (who behaved very bravely) &amp; as their number was much greater, it is
					likely they suffer'd still more, but of their loss I have no particular account. in the village of Tonhausen near at hand were all the
					Hessian Artillery, wch, being now turned upon the French, soon silenced their Cannon, &amp; gave an opportunity to come to closer
					engagement. the conflict after this lasted but an hour &amp; quarter; the French made a poor &amp; shameful resistance, &amp; were
					dispersed &amp; routed on all sides. the Marshal himself (having detach'd a body of Men to try, if they could save or burn Herwart)
					retreated along the Weser toward <hi rend="italic">Rintelen &amp; Corvey,</hi> but wrote a letter to the Prince to say, 'that as Minden
					must now soon fall into the hands of his <hi rend="italic">victorious troops</hi> he doubted not, but he would treat the Wounded &amp;
					Sick (who were all lodged there) with his usual humanity.' accordingly he enter'd Minden the next day. 8000 only of ye French were
					slain in the field, 20 pieces of Canon (16 Pounders) taken &amp; 12 Standards. the number of prisoners, &amp; the slaughter in the
					pursuit, not so great as it might have been, for the English Horse (tho' they received orders to move) stir'd not a foot, nor had any
					share in the action. this is unaccountable, but true; &amp; we shall soon hear a greater noise about it. (Ld G: S:)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1057tm" />
				</p>
				<p>The Prince of Brunswick fell in with the party sent towards Herwart, entirely routed it, took 5 pieces of Cannon, the Town, &amp; all
					the Magazines. </p>
				<p>The loss of ye Russians<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1058tm" /> is not what has been reported: their march toward Silesia however was
					stop'd, &amp; the King of Prussia is gone in person to attack them.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1059tm" />

					<salute>My dear Sir, </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I wonder whether you think me capable of all the gratitude I really feel for the late marks you have given me of your friendship, I
					will venture to say if you knew my heart you wou'd be content with it, but knowing my exterior so well as you do You can easily
					conceive me Vain of the Partiallity you show me; in return for puting me in good humour with myself I will give you pleasure by
					assuring you Lady Cobham<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1069tm" /> is surprizingly well &amp; most extremely oblig'd to you for the Anxiety you
					express'd on her account.&#x2013;we now take the Air ev'ry day and are returnd to our old way of living and hope we shall go on in the
					same way many Years. </p>
				<p>we are both scandaliz'd at your being in Town at this time of year, not because (as you may think) that it is unfashionable, but
					because we think it very unwholsome from the heat of the Season &#x2013; now I know you are insensible to heat or cold, not but that
					your Body suffers by either extreme, but you have not attention enough to your self to seek a remedy, we beg now to point out one
					against the Excessive heat of London, by desiring you wou'd come down to Stoke<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1070tm" /> where you will find
					Ev'ry thing cool but the reception we shall give you&#x2013;there is always a Bed Air'd for you &amp; one for your Servt; indeed I can
					make use of the Strongest argument to tempt you which is that at this time it will be a deed of Charity as we are absolutely alone. Mrs
					Clavering and Mr Crane the Apothecary left us Yesterday, I dont know whether you are acquainted with the latter but I have such a
					partiallity from his attendance on Lady Cobham that I almost wish for a Slight fit of illness that I may have something to do with him
					&#x2013; if you are at present an invalide let that prompt you to come, for from the <hi rend="italic">affected creature</hi> you knew
					me, I am nothing now but a comfortable nurse &#x2013;</p>
				<p>You sent me dreadfull News in regard to the K. of P.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1071tm" /> I now begin to fear for him, it was vastly
					good of you to Give us a detail of what passes in the World for few People will be at that trouble, indeed a certain Countess with whom
					I correspond does not Spare pains, but such news as she sends is not always to be depended on &#x2013; I have kept her last Letter for
					your Entertainment;</p>
				<p>I am au desespoire about my friend L. G. S.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1072tm" /> and am sorry from different hands to hear that his
					narative is about as much in his favor as you seem to think his Letter to Co:l Fitzroy<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1073tm" /> &#x2013; I
					hope to talk all these matters over with you soon therefore shall add no more at present but that I am with great truth</p>

				<p> The Death of the poor Alderman<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1076tm" /> is an event, that you have so long weekly expected, that (tho' it

				<p> I am sorry to hear of the attempt making to deprive your Mamma<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1077tm" /> of her Office<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1078tm" /> at such a time, &amp; do not understand upon what pretences your enemies should ground such a proceeding,
					when she had so lately too obtain'd a confirmation of it. they charge her to be sure with something; whether justly or unjustly is not
					the Question, but any Friend, who would enter into her cause &amp; justify her effectually, must be acquainted with what is objected,
					&amp; with the reasons she can alledge in her own defence, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> are (I hope) sufficient to set aside the malice of
					these people. M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Shelvocke, if he is continued in his office, seems the first Person to apply to, &amp; (I should
					imagine) you have already done so. tho' I have not seen him for years, I should not scruple speaking to him myself, but that you have
					not furnish'd me with any thing to say; &amp; (if he should not be a friend to our cause, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> is a thing I do not
					know) I might perhaps do more hurt than good by interposing. neither of the Post-Masters are (as you suppose) related to M<hi
						rend="super">r</hi> Pitt:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1080tm" /> one is the Earl of Bessborough,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1081tm" /> &amp;
					the other M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Trevor-Hambden.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1082tm" /> what I could, I have done: by this night's post I
					have wrote to L<hi rend="super">d</hi> John Cavendish,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1083tm" /> who is Brother<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1084tm"
					 /> to L<hi rend="super">d</hi> Bessborough, to desire he would write, or speak a word in behalf of your Mamma: but he is as far off as
					Chatsworth in Derbyshire, &amp; besides (tho' I believe inclined enough to oblige me) naturally very shy &amp; backward in asking any
					thing even from his nearest Relations. therefore I can by no means promise myself success, &amp; especially if the case should be (what
					I once told you I was afraid of) that M<hi rend="super">rs</hi> A:<hi rend="super">s</hi><anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1085tm" /> should have
					trusted your Gr: Papa with any money belonging to the Office, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> may be now suddenly demanded of her, w<hi
						rend="super">ch</hi> I should be extremely sorry for.</p>
				<p>If there is any thing else I can do, inform me; but my connection with People in power is very small, &amp; that little I have never
					employed in asking favours at their hands, even for myself. I do not recollect any body, that I know, who has any interest in M<hi

					<salute>Dear Doctr. </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I can not say any thing to you about Mason, whose motions I am entirely a stranger to, &amp; have not once heard from him since he
					left London; till (the 3d of this month) a letter came, in wch he tells me, that Gaskarth<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1089tm" /> is at Aston
					with him, &amp; that the latter end of the month, or beginning of the next, he shall be in Town as he goes into waiting the last
					fortnight in October. Ld H:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1090tm" /> has sent him no less than four Expresses (literally so) with publick News
					good &amp; bad, wch has made him of infinite importance in the eyes of that neighbourhood. I can not pretend therefore to guess,
					whether he will be able to come to you. I am sorry to tell you that I try in vain to execute your commission about tapestry. what is so
					bad, as wry-mouthed histories? and yet for this they ask me at least double the price you talk of. I have seen nothing neither, that
					would please me at any price: yet I allow tapestry (if at all tolerable) to be a very proper furniture for your sort of house; but
					doubt, if any bargain of that kind is to be met with, except at some old mansion-sale in the country, where People will disdain
					tapestry, because they hear, that Paper<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1091tm" /> is all the fashion. Stonhewer<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1092tm"
					 /> has been in Northamptonshire till now: as you told me the subject of your letter, I did not send it thither to him, besides that he
					was every day expected in Town. at last he is come, &amp; has it; but I have not yet seen him: he is gone today (I believe) to
					Portsmouth to receive a Morocco Embassador, but returns very shortly. there is one advantage in getting into your Abbey at
					Christmas-time: that it will be at its worst, &amp; if you can bear it then, you need not fear for the rest of the year. Mr W: has
					lately made a new Bed-chamber,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1093tm" /> wch as it is in the best tast of any thing he has yet done, &amp; in
					your own Gothic way, I must describe a little. you enter by a peaked door at one corner of the room (out of a narrow winding passage,
					you may be sure) into an Alcove, in wch the bed is to stand, formed by a screen of pierced work opening by one large arch in the middle
					to the rest of the chamber, wch is lighted at the other end by a bow-window of three days,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1094tm" /> whose tops
					are of rich painted glass in mosaïc.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1095tm" /> the cieling is coved &amp; fretted in star &amp; quatrefoil
					compartments with roses at the intersections, all in papier-maché. the chimney on your left is the high-altar in the Cathedral of Rouen
					(from whence the Screen also is taken)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1096tm" /> consisting of a low surbased Arch between two octagon Towers,
					whose pinnacles almost reach the Cieling, all of Nich-work. the chairs &amp; dressing-table are real carved Ebony, pick'd up at
					auctions. the hangings uniform purple paper, hung all over with the Court of Henry, ye 8th, copied after the Holbein's in the Queen's
					Closet at Kensington, in black &amp; gold frames. the bed is to be either from Burleigh<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1097tm" /> (for Ld
						Exeter<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1098tm" /> is new-furnishing it, &amp; means to sell some of his original houshold-stuff) of the rich
					old tarnish'd embroidery; or if that is not to be had, &amp; it must be new, it is to be a cut velvet with a dark purple pattern on a
					stone-colour sattin-ground, &amp; deep mixt fringes, &amp; tassels.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1099tm" /> there's for you, but I want you
					to see it. in the mean time I live in the Musæum, &amp; write volumes of antiquity. I have got (out of the original Ledger-book of the
					Signet) K: Richard 3d's Oath to Elizabeth, <hi rend="italic">late calling herself Queen of</hi> England; to prevail upon her to come
					out of Sanctuary with her 5 Daughters.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1100tm" /> his Grant to Lady Hastings &amp; her Son, dated 6 weeks after
					he had cut off her Husband's head.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1101tm" /> a Letter to his Mother;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1102tm" /> another
					to his Chancellor,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1103tm" /> to persuade his Sollicitor General<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1104tm" /> not to marry
					Jane Shore then in Ludgate by his command. Sr Tho: Wyat's Defence at his Tryal, when accused by Bp Bonner of high-treason;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1105tm" /> Lady Purbeck &amp; her Son's remarkable Case,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1106tm" /> &amp; several more odd
					things unknown to our Historians. when I come home, I have a great heap of ye Conway-papers<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1107tm" /> (wch is a
					secret) to read, &amp; make out. in short I am up to the ears.</p>
				<p>The Fish you mention is so accurately described that I know it at sight. it is the <hi rend="italic">Ink-fish,</hi> or Loligo of the
					Romans. in Greek <hi rend="italic">Τευθὸς</hi>, in Italian, Calamaio. in French, Calmar. you will find it ranged by Linnæus in the

					pag: 659. the smaller ones are eaten as a delicacy fried, with their own ink for sauce, by the Italians &amp; others. you may see it in
						Aldrovandus.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1108tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I do not see much myself of the face of nature here, but I enquire. Wheat was cutting in Kent the 23d of July. the 25th at Enfield.
					the 27th Wheat, Barley, &amp; Oats cutting all at once about Windsor: the forward Pease all got in, ground plough'd and turneps sow'd.
					9th of August Harvest still continued in Buck:re. the 27th about Kennington it was just over, being delay'd for want of hands. in some
					places 50 mile from London it is but just over now for the same reason. the 3d of Aug: Catherine-pears, Muscle-Plums, &amp; small black
					Cherries were sold in wheelbarrows. Filberds in plenty the 8th. Mulberries, &amp; fine green-gage plums, the 19th. fine Nectarines
					&amp; Peaches, the 27th. the 4th of Sept:r Melons &amp; Perdrigon-plums. the 8th, Walnuts 20 a penny. this is all I know about fruit.
					my Weather is not very compleat. </p>

					stay'd half an hour too long. I shall not wonder therefore, if your Friend should make a mistake of half a year, if your occasions did
					not call you to Town sooner. when you come, I should hope, you would stay the winter, but can advise nothing in a point, where my own
					interest is so much concerned. pray, let me know of your arrival immediately, that I may cut short my visitation here, or at least (if
					you are taken up always at Sion,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1113tm" /> or Kensington<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1114tm" />) may meet you at
						Hounslow,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1115tm" /> or at Billy Robinson's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1116tm" /> or somewhere. my only employment

					 /> no day has pass'd, but she has gone ten or twelve miles &amp; more in her chaise, &amp; never the worse for so much exercise.
					almost always an appetite both at dinner &amp; supper, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> in my mind she satisfies, as usual, a little too
					freely. her breath at times short (particularly in the evening,) &amp; sinking of the spirits by fits: but none of those convulsive
					gaspings, nor that bar across the stomach she complain'd of at Stoke. the great malady now is want of sleep, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi>
					I can not say, she has enjoy'd in a natural way (except for an hour or two at most, &amp; that in the day-time) since we came to Town.

						w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> the whole following day she has appear'd, as one in perfect health. the rest of her nights are pass'd in
					continual inquietude. her medecines have been several times changed: these three last days she has left off Laudanum &amp; every thing
					else, and taken crude Quicksilver in the morning only. it seems to take some effect; at least she is certainly not the worse for it,
					&amp; flatters herself, she is rather better. if any new symptom of consequence should follow, I will take care to inform you. D<hi

				<p> I am not dead, as you probably imagine, but have been employ'd in seeing the gradual approaches of death in poor Lady Cobham, whom I

						week.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1127tm" /> affairs of my own obliged me to come home to Southampton-Row. I have left her growi[ng]<anchor

					don't be sparing of your bottled Beer.</p>
				<p> I am very well satisfied with my new place of abode here.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1131tm" /> my fatigue of furnishing was soon over,
					for I have no furniture at all but a bed to lie on, half of w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> is much at your service. pray come, &amp; we'll

					one Pair, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> will do to cover a Sofa, or two Great Chairs. now here are three Windows to be provided for. is it
					possible to get a Linnen approaching to the colours &amp; pattern of the Chintz; or will it be absurd to put up some silky thing of a

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I know not what to say to you after so long a silence, but that I have been down at Stoke to see poor Lady Cobham, &amp; after about
					three weeks pass'd there, she being obliged to come for advice (as they call it) to Town, I return'd with her, &amp; have been
					eversince, till about ten days ago, by her desire in the house with her in Hanover Square.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1140tm" /> she is
					dying (as it now plainly appears) of a Dropsy, &amp; the contemplation of ling'ring death is not apt to raise the spirits of any
					Spectator [ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1141tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I have had an enquiry from Mr. Jonathan<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1142tm" /> about painted glass, &amp; have given him such information,
					as I could procure. the manufacture at York seems to be the thing for your purpose, but the name of the Person<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1143tm" /> I can not learn. he at Worcester<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1144tm" /> sells it for two Shillings a pound (for
					it is sold by weight). I approve very well of the canopy-work border on the sides of each light descending to the bottom, provided it
					do not darken the window too much, &amp; take up so much of the 20 inches space, as to make the plain glass in the middle appear
					over-narrow. but I have been more used to see the whole top of colour'd glass (from where the Arch begins to turn) the gloom above
					contributing much to the beauty of the clear view below. I can not decide: the first is more Gothic &amp; more uncommon. the latter
					more convenient, &amp; more chearful. Green glass is not classical, nor ever seen in a real Church-window, but where there is History
					painted, &amp; there the Green is remarkably bad. I propose, the rich amethyst-purple instead of it. the mosaic pattern can hardly come
					amiss, only do not let too much yellow &amp; scarlet come together, if I could describe the Mosaïc at Mr. W:s<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1145tm" /> it would be of no use to you, because it is not merely made of squares put together, but painted in a
					pattern by Price,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1146tm" /> &amp; shaded. it is as if little Balaustines, or Pomegranate-flowers, were set four
					together, &amp; formed a lozenge. these are of a golden yellow with a white Pearl at the junctions, &amp; the spaces inclosed by them
					are scarlet, or blew. this repeated makes a Diaper-work, &amp; fills the whole top of the window. I am sorry any of your designs depend
					upon Virginia;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1147tm" /> I fear it will fail you. St:r<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1148tm" /> tells me, you have a
					neighbouring scene [superi]or to any banks of the Thames, where I am to live. [ ] lodge<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1149tm" /> me? Mason has

						Swithin's-Alley,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1162tm" /> &amp; perish'd in the flames. two other Persons were destroy'd (in the charitable

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I am much obliged to you for your antique News: Froissard<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1177tm" /> is a favourite book of mine (tho' I have
					not attentively read him, but only dip'd here &amp; there) &amp; it is strange to me that People who would give thousands for a dozen
					Portraits (Originals of that time) to furnish a gallery, should never cast an eye on so many moving pictures of the life, actions,
					manners, &amp; thoughts of their Ancestors done on the spot, &amp; in strong, tho' simple colours. in the succeeding Century Froissard
					(I find) was read with great satisfaction by every body, that could read; &amp; on the same footing with King Arthur,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1178tm" /> Sr Tristram,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1179tm" /> &amp; Archbishop Turpin:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1180tm" />
					not because they thought him a fabulous Writer, but because they took them all for true and authentic Historians. to so little purpose
					was it in that age for a Man to be at the pains of writing truth! pray, are you come to the four Irish Kings, that went to school to K:
					Richard the 2d.'s Master of the Ceremonies;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1181tm" /> &amp; the Man,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1182tm" /> who
					informed Froissard of all he had seen in St Patrick's Purgatory?</p>
				<p>You ask after Quebec. Gen: Townsend<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1183tm" /> says, it is much like Richmond-Hill, &amp; the River as fine
					(but bigger) &amp; the Vale as <hi rend="italic">riant,</hi> as rich, &amp; as well cultivated. no great matters are attributed to his
					conduct. the Officer, who brought over the news,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1184tm" /> when the Pr: of W: ask'd, how long Gen: T: commanded
					in the action after Wolfe's death? answer'd, a Minute, Sr. it is certain, he was not at all well with Wolfe,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1185tm" /> who for some time had not cared to consult with him, or communicate any of his designs to him. he has
					brought home an Indian Boy with him (design'd for Ld G: Sackville, but he did not chuse to take him) who goes about in his own dress,
					&amp; is brought into the room to divert his company. the Gen:l after dinner one day had been shewing them a box of scalps &amp; some
					Indian arms &amp; utensils. when they were gone, the Boy got to the box &amp; found a scalp, wch he knew by the hair belong'd to one of
					his own nation. he grew into a sudden fury (tho' but eleven years old) &amp; catching up one of the scalping-knives made at his Master
					with intention to murther him, who in his surprise hardly knew how to avoid him, &amp; by laying open his breast, making signs, &amp;
					with a few words of French Jargon, that the Boy understood, at last with much difficulty pacified him. the first rejoicing night he was
					terribly frighted, and thought the bonefire was made for him, &amp; that they were going to torture &amp; devour him. he is mighty fond
					of venison blood-raw; &amp; once they caught him flourishing his knife over a dog that lay asleep by the fire, because (he said) it was
						<hi rend="italic">bon manger.</hi>
				</p>
				<p>You have heard of the Irish disturbances<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1186tm" /> (I reckon). never were two Houses of Parliament so
					bepiss'd &amp; shit upon: this is not a figure, but literally so. they placed an old Woman on the Throne,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1187tm" /> &amp; called for pipes &amp; tobacco; made my Lord Chief-Justice<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1188tm" />
					administer an oath (wch they dictated) to my Ld Chancellor;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1189tm" /> beat the Bp of Killaloe<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1190tm" /> black &amp; blew; play'd at football with Chenevix,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1191tm" /> the old refugié Bp of
					Waterford; roll'd my Ld Farnham<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1192tm" /> in the Kennel; pulled Sr Tho: Prendergast<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1193tm" /> by the nose (naturally large) till it was the size of a Cauliflower; &amp; would have hanged Rigby,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1194tm" /> if he had not got out of a window. all this time <hi rend="italic">the Castle</hi> remain'd in perfect
					tranquillity. at last the Guard was obliged to move (with orders not to fire) but the Mob threw dirt at them. then the Horse broke in
					upon them, cutting &amp; slashing, and took 17 prisoners: next morning they were all set at liberty, &amp; said to be poor silly
					people, that knew nothing of the matter. the same night there was a Ball at the Castle, &amp; Play till four in the morning. this
					tumult happen'd two days before the news of Hawke's victory got to Dublin; &amp; there was another some time before, when first it was
					known that the Brest-Fleet had sail'd.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1195tm" /> warning was given (from the <hi rend="italic">best hands</hi>
					in England) six weeks before that time, that there would be a <hi rend="italic">rising of the Papists</hi> in Ireland; &amp; the first
					person, whom the Mob insulted, was a Mr Rowley, a Member always in opposition to the Court, but a <hi rend="italic">Presbyterian.</hi>
					it is strange (but, I am assured, true) that the Government have not yet received any account of the matter from thence, &amp; all the
					Irish here are ready to fight a Man, that says there has been any riot at all at Dublin.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1196tm" /> the notion,
					that had possess'd the crowd, was, that a Union was to be voted between the two Nations, &amp; they should have no more Parliaments
					there.</p>
				<p>Prince F: has done a strange thing in Germany. we have always studiously avoided doing anything to incur the Ban of the Empire. he
					has now (without waiting for commands from hence) detach'd 14000 Men, the Flower of his flock, to assist the K: of Prussia in Saxony
					against the Empress-Queen &amp; the Empire.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1197tm" /> the old Gentleman<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1198tm" /> does

					his own pocket; don't mistake: but out of yours under the head of Extraordinaries). a great Fleet is preparing, &amp; an expedition
					going forward; but nobody knows whereto: some say Martinico, others Minorca. all thought of a Congress is vanish'd, since the Empress
					has shew'd herself so cool to our proposal.</p>
				<p>Mr. Pitt<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1199tm" /> (not the Great, but the little one, my acquaintance) is setting out on his travels. he
					goes with my Ld Kinnoul<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1200tm" /> to Lisbon; then (by Sea still) to Cales, then up the Guadalquivir to Seville
					&amp; Cordova, &amp; so perhaps to Toledo, but certainly to Granada; and after breathing the perfumed air of Andalusia, &amp;
					contemplating the remains of Moorish Magnificence, reembarks at Gibraltar or Malaga, &amp; sails to Genoa. sure an extraordinary good
					way of passing a few winter-months, &amp; better than dragging thro' Holland, Germany, &amp; Switzerland, to the same place. now we
					have been contriving to get my Ld Str:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1201tm" /> (for whose advantage it will be in several respects) to bear a
					part in this expedition, &amp; today we have brought it about, and they will go in a fortnight: but this is a secret, &amp; you must
					not tell, for fear my Lady<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1202tm" /> should be frighted at so much Sea.</p>
				<p>The Attorney<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1203tm" /> and Sollic:r General<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1204tm" /> (to whom it was refer'd) have
					declared that Ld G: S:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1205tm" /> may be tried by a Court-Martial.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1206tm" /> Ld
						H:sse<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1207tm" /> has wrote him a letter to inform him of this, &amp; <hi rend="italic">desires</hi> to know
					(these are the words) how his Ldp <hi rend="italic">would have</hi> them proceed, as there is no <hi rend="italic">specific charge</hi>
					against him. I am told, he has answer'd, that he cannot pretend to prescribe how a Court, that sits in judgement upon him, is to
					proceed against him. that he well knows, nothing can justly be alledged against him; but doubts not from Pr: Ferdinand's treatment of
					him, that there was some charge against him, especially as he finds himself <hi rend="italic">dismiss'd from all his employments.</hi>
					I hear too, that (whatever the Lawyers have said) the General Officers insist, they will not have any thing to do with his cause, as he
					is no longer of the Army.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1208tm" /> so (I suppose) after a little bustle the matter will drop.<anchor

				<p>Here is a new Farce of Macklin<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1210tm" /> the Player's, that delights the Town much, Love a-la-Mode.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1211tm" /> a Beau-Jew, an English Gentleman-Jockey, a Scotch Baronet, &amp; an Irish Officer in the Prussian-Service,
					that make love to a Merchant's Niece. the Irishman is the Heroe, &amp; the happy Man, as he deserves; for Sr Reilichan O'Callaghan is a

					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I received the little letter,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1221tm" /> &amp; the inclosed, wch was a summons from the Insurance-Office. on
					Tuesday last came a dispatch from Lisbon. it is probable you have had one from my Lord,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1222tm" /> but least you
					should not, I will tell you the chief contents of mine. Mr Pitt says, they were both dreadfully sick all the time they were beating
					about the Channel, but when they came to Plymouth (I find) my Lord was so well however, that he open'd a Ball in the Dock-yard with the
					Master-Attendant's Daughter. they set sail from thence on the 28th,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1223tm" /> &amp; cross'd the Bay with a very
					smooth Sea, came in sight of C. Finisterre in 3 days time, &amp; before night saw the rugged Mountains of Galicia with great delight,
					&amp; came near the coast of Portugal opposite to Oporto. but (the wind changing in the night) they drove off to the West, and were in
					a way to visit the Brasils. however on the 7th of this month they enter'd the Tagus. he describes the Rock of Lisbon, as a most
					romantic &amp; beautiful scene; &amp; all the North-bank of the river up to the City has (he says) every charm but verdure. the City
					itself too in that view is very noble, &amp; shews but little of the Earthquake.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1224tm" /> that is all as
						yet.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1225tm" /> my Ld is to write next packet.</p>
				<p>Ld G: S:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1226tm" /> proceeds in his defence. People wonder at, (&amp; some there are that celebrate) his
					dexterity, his easy elocution, &amp; unembarass'd manner. he told Gen: Cholmondeley,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1227tm" /> one of his
					Judges, who was asking a Witness some Question, that it was such a question as no Gentleman, or Man of honour, would put, &amp; it was
					one of his misfortunes to have him among his Judges. upon wch some Persons behind him gave a loud clap. but I do not find the Court
					either committed or reprimanded them. Ld Albemarle<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1228tm" /> only contented himself with saying, he was sure,
					that those Men could be neither Gentlemen, nor Men of honour. in the midst of this I do not hear any one point made out in his favour;
					&amp; Col: Sloper,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1229tm" /> whose evidence bore the hardest upon him, &amp; whom he had reflected upon with
					great warmth, &amp; very opprobrious terms, has offer'd the Court (if they had any doubt of his veracity) to produce 16 more Witnesses,
					who will say the same thing. to be sure nothing in the Field of Minden could be half as dreadful, as this daily baiting he now is
					exposed to; so (supposing him a Coward) he has chose very ill.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1230tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I am not very sorry, your Venetians<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1231tm" /> have abandon'd you: no more (I believe) are you. Mason is very
					well, sitting (as usual) for his picture,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1232tm" /> &amp; while that is doing, will not think of Yorkshire. we
					heard Delaval<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1233tm" /> the other night play upon the water-glasses,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1234tm" /> &amp; I
					was astonish'd. no instrument, that I know, has so celestial a tone. I thought it was a Cherubim in a box.</p>

				<p>I am so charmed with the two specimens of Erse poetry,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1239tm" /> that I cannot help giving you the trouble to
					enquire a little farther about them, and should wish to see a few lines of the original, that I may form some slight idea of the

				</p>
				<p>Is there anything known of the author or authors, and of what antiquity are they supposed to be? </p>
				<p>Is there any more to be had of equal beauty, or at all approaching to it?<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1241tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I have been often told that the poem called Hardicanute (which I always admired, and still admire) was the work of somebody that
					lived a few years ago.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1242tm" /> This I do not at all believe, though it has evidently been retouched in places
					by some modern hand: but, however, I am authorised by this report to ask, whether the two poems in question are certainly antique and
					genuine. I make this enquiry in quality of an antiquary, and am not otherwise concerned about it: for, if I were sure that any one now
					living in Scotland had written them to divert himself and laugh at the credulity of the world, I would undertake a journey into the
					Highlands only for the pleasure of seeing him.</p>

					<dateline>April 22. 1760. London. </dateline>
					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I am not sorry to hear, you are exceeding busy, except as it has deprived me of the pleasure I should have in hearing often from you,
					&amp; as it has been occasion'd by a little vexation &amp; disappointment. to find oneself business (I am persuaded) is the great art
					of life;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1244tm" /> &amp; I am never so angry, as when I hear my acquaintance wishing they had been bred to some
					poking profession, or employ'd in some office of drudgery, as if it were pleasanter to be at the command of other People, than at one's
					own; &amp; as if they could not go, unless they were wound up. yet I know and feel, what they mean by this complaint: it proves, that
					some spirit, something of Genius (more than common) is required to teach a Man how to employ himself. I say <hi rend="italic">a
						Man,</hi> for Women commonly speaking never feel this distemper: they have always something to do; time hangs not on their hands
					(unless they be fine Ladies) a variety of small inventions &amp; occupations fill up the void, &amp; their eyes are never open in
					vain.</p>
				<p>I thank you heartily for the Sow.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1245tm" /> if you have no occasion for her, I have; &amp; if his Ldp will be
					so kind as to drive her up to Town, will gladly give him 40 shillings and the Chitterlings into the bargain. I could repay you with the
					Story of my Lady F:r,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1246tm" /> but (I doubt) you know my Sow already, especially as you dwell near Raby.
					however I'll venture: it may happen, you have not heard it. About 2 months ago Mr. Creswick (the D: of Cleveland's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1247tm" /> managing Man) received an anonymous letter as from a Lady, offering him (if he would bring about a match
					between her &amp; his Lord) 3000£ to be paid after marriage out of the Estate. if he came into the proposal, a place was named, where
					he might speak with the Party. he carried the letter directly to the old Lady Darlington<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1248tm" /> &amp; they
					agreed, he should go to the place. he did so, &amp; found there a Man, Agent for the Lady: but refusing to treat with any but
					Principals, after a little difficulty was conducted to her in person, &amp; found it was my Lady F: (Sr Ev: F:s fine young Widow). what
					pass'd between them, I know not: but that very night she was at Lady Darl:n's Assembly (as she had used to be) &amp; no notice taken.
					the next morning she received a card to say, Lady D: had not expected to see her, <hi rend="italic">after what had pass'd:</hi>
					otherwise she would have order'd her Porter not to let her in. the whole affair was immediately told to every body. yet she has
					continued going about to all publick places <hi rend="italic">tête levée,</hi> &amp; solemnly denying the whole to her acquaintance.
					since that I hear she owns it, &amp; says, her Children were unprovided for, &amp; desires to know, wch of her Friends would not have
					done the same? but as neither of these expedients succeed very well, she has hired a small house, &amp; is going into the Country for
					the summer.</p>
				<p>Here has just been a Duel between the Duke of Bolton<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1249tm" /> &amp; Mr. Stuart<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1250tm" /> (a Candidate for the County of Hampshire at the late Election) what the quarrel was, I do not know: but
					they met near Marybone, &amp; the D: in making a pass over-reached himself, fell down, &amp; hurt his knee. the other bid him get up,
					but he could not. then he bid him ask his life, but he would not. so he let him alone, and that's all. Mr. Steuart was slightly
						wounded.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1251tm" />
				</p>
				<p>The old Pundles,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1252tm" /> that sat on Ld G: Sackvile (for they were all such, but two, Gen:
						Cholmondeley,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1253tm" /> &amp; Ld Albemarle<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1254tm" />) have at last hammer'd out their
					sentence. he is declared disobedient, &amp; unfit for all military command. it is said, that 9 (out of the 15) were for death,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1255tm" /> but as two-thirds must be unanimous, some of them came over to the merciful side. I do not affirm the truth
					of this. what he will do with himself, no body guesses. the poor old Duke<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1256tm" /> went into the country some
					time ago, &amp; (they say) can hardly bear the sight of any body. the unembarass'd countenance, the looks of soveraign contempt &amp;
					superiority, that his Lp bestow'd on his Accusers during the tryal, were the admiration of all: but his usual Talents &amp; Art did not
					appear, in short his Cause would not support him. be that as it will, every body blames <hi rend="italic">somebody,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1257tm" /> who has been out of all temper, &amp; intractable during the whole time. Smith<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1258tm" /> (the Aid-de-Camp, and principal Witness for Ld G:) had no sooner finish'd his evidence, but he was forbid
					to mount guard, &amp; order'd to sell out. the Court &amp; the Criminal went halves in the expence of the short-hand Writer, so Ld G:
					has already publish'd the Tryal, before the authentic Copy appears; &amp; in it are all the foolish questions, that were asked, &amp;
					the absurdities of his Judges. you may think perhaps he intends to go abroad, &amp; hide his head. au contraire, all the World visits
					him on his condemnation. he says himself, his situation is better, than ever it was. the Scotch have all along affected to take him
					under their protection; his Wife<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1259tm" /> has been daily walking with Lady Augusta<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1260tm" /> (during the tryal) in Leicester-Gardens, &amp; Ld B:s<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1261tm" /> Chariot stands at
					his door by the hour.</p>
				<p>Ld Ferrers<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1262tm" /> has entertained the Town for three days. I was not there, but Mason &amp; Stonhewer were
					in the D: of Ancaster's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1263tm" /> Gallery &amp; in the greatest danger (wch I believe they do not yet know
					themselves) for the Cell underneath them (to wch the Prisoner retires) was on fire during the tryal, &amp; the D: of Anc:r with the
					Workmen by sawing away some timbers &amp; other assistance contrived to put it out without any alarm given to the Court: several now
					recollect they smelt burning &amp; heard a noise of sawing, but no one guest at the cause. Miss Johnson, Daughter to the murther'd Man,
					appeard so cool, &amp; gave so gentle an evidence, that at first sight every one concluded, she was bought off: but this could do him
					little good. the Surgeon &amp; his own Servants laid open such a scene of barbarity &amp; long-meditated malice, as left no room for
					his plea of Lunacy, nor any thought of pity in the hearers. the oddest thing was this plea of temporary Lunacy, &amp; his producing two
					Brothers of his to prove it, one a Clergyman<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1264tm" /> (suspended for Methodism by the Bp of London<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1265tm" />) the other a sort of Squire, that goes in the countrey by the name of <hi rend="italic">Ragged &amp;
						Dangerous.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1266tm" /> he managed the cause himself with more cleverness than any of his Counsell, &amp; (when found
					guilty) ask'd pardon for his plea, &amp; laid it upon the persuasions of his family.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1267tm" /> Mrs Shirley (his
						Mother<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1268tm" />) Lady Huntingdon,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1269tm" /> &amp; others of the relations were at
					Court yesterday with a petition for mercy, but on the 5th of May he is to be hang'd at Tyburn.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1270tm" />
				</p>
				<p>The Town are reading the K: of Prussia's Poetry (Le Philosophe sans Souci)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1271tm" /> &amp; I have done, like
					the Town. they do not seem so sick of it, as I am. it is all the scum of Voltaire and Ld Bolingbroke, the <hi rend="italic">Crambe
						recocta</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1272tm" /> of our worst Free-thinkers, toss'd up in German-French rhyme.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1273tm" />
					Tristram Shandy<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1274tm" /> is still a greater object of admiration, the Man<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1275tm" /> as
					well as the Book. one is invited to dinner, where he dines, a fortnight beforehand. his portrait is done by Reynolds,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1276tm" /> &amp; now engraving. Dodsley gives 700£ for a second edition,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1277tm" /> &amp; two
					new volumes not yet written;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1278tm" /> &amp; tomorrow will come out two Volumes of Sermons<anchor

					Cousin Shandy on his coming to Town, the other to the grown Gentlewomen, the Misses of York:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1281tm" /> they
					seem to me to be absolute madness. these are the best lines in them</p>
				<q>
					<p>I'll tell you a story of Elijah &#x2013; <lb /> Close by a Mob of Children stood <lb /> Commenting on his sober mood &amp;c: <lb />
						And back'd them (their opinions) like such sort of folks <lb /> With a few stones &amp; a few jokes: <lb /> Till, weary of their

				<p>First &amp; foremost pray take notice of the Paper, on wch I am writing to you: it is the first, that ever was made of silk-rags,
					upon the encouragement given by your Society of Arts;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1289tm" /> &amp; (if this were all the fruits) I think you
					need not regret your two Guineas a-year. the colour &amp; texture you see; &amp; besides I am told, it will not burn (at least will not
					flame) like ordinary paper, so that it may be of great use for hanging rooms. it is uncommonly tough, &amp; tho' very thin, you
					observe, is not transparent.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1290tm" /> here is another sort of it intended for the uses of Drawing. </p>
				<p>You have lately had a visit,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1291tm" /> where you are, that I am sure bodes no good, especially just at the
					time that the D: of C:y,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1292tm" /> &amp; Mr Blacowe<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1293tm" /> died. we attribute it to
					a <hi rend="italic">Miff</hi> about the Garter,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1294tm" /> &amp; some other humps &amp; grumps,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1295tm" /> that he has received. alas! I fear, it will never do. the Conde de Fuentes<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1296tm"
					 /> was much at a loss, &amp; had like to have made a quarrel of it, that he had no body but the D: of N:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1297tm" /> to introduce him: but Miss Chudleigh<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1298tm" /> has appeased him with a Ball.</p>
				<p>I have sent Musæus<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1299tm" /> to Mr Fraser,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1300tm" /> scratched here &amp; there;
					&amp; with it I desired him to inclose a bloody Satyr, written against no less Persons than you &amp; me by name.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1301tm" /> I concluded at first it was Mr Pottinger,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1302tm" /> because he is your Friend &amp;
					my humble Servant; but then I thought he knew the World too well to call us the favorite Minions of Taste,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1303tm" /> &amp; of Fashion, especially as to Odes, for to them his abuse is confined. so it is not Secretary
					Pottinger, but Mr Coleman,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1304tm" /> nephew to my Lady Bath, Author of the Connoisseur, a Member of some of the
					Inns of Court, &amp; a particular Acquaintance of Mr Garrick. what have you done to him? for I never heard his name before. he makes

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I heard yesterday from your old Friend Mr. Field,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1317tm" /> that Mrs Wharton had brought you a Son,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1318tm" /> &amp; as I sincerely hope this may be some addition to your happiness, I heartily congratulate you both on
					the occasion. another thing I rejoice in is, to know, that you not only grow reconciled to your scene, but discover beauties round you,
					that once were deformities. I am persuaded the whole matter is to have always something going forward. happy they, that can create a
					rose-tree, or erect a honey-suckle, that can watch the brood of a Hen, or see a fleet of their own ducklings launch into the water! it
					is with a sentiment of envy I speak it, who never shall have even a thatch'd roof of my own, nor gather a strawberry but in
					Covent-Garden. I will not believe in the <hi rend="italic">vocality</hi> of Old-Park till next summer, when perhaps I may trust my own
					ears.</p>
				<p>I remain (bating some few little excursions, that I have made) still in Town, tho' for these three weeks I have been going into
						Oxfordshire<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1319tm" /> with Madam Speed; but her affairs, as she says, or her vagaries, as I say, have obliged
					her to alter her mind ten times within that space: no wonder, for she has got at least 30,000£ with a house in Town, plate, jewels,
					china, &amp; old-japan infinite, so that indeed it would be ridiculous for her to know her own mind. I, who know mine, do intend to go
					to Cambridge, but that Owl Fobus is going thither to the Commencement, so that I am forced to stay till his Nonsense is at an
						end.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1320tm" /> Chapman<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1321tm" /> you see is dead at last, wch signifies not much, I
					take it, to any body, for his family (they say) are left in good circumstances. I am neither sorry, nor glad, for M: (I doubt) will
					scarce succeed to his Prebend. the old Creature is down at Aston, where my Lord has paid him a visit lately, as the Town says, in <hi
						rend="italic">a Miff,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1322tm" /> about the garter,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1323tm" /> &amp; other <hi rend="italic">Frumps,</hi> he
					has met with of late. I believe, this at least is certain, that he has deserted his old attachments, &amp; worships another
						Idol,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1324tm" /> who receives his incense with a good deal of coldness &amp; negligence.</p>
				<p>I can tell you but little of St Germain.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1325tm" /> he saw Mons:r D'Affry<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1326tm" /> at
					the Hague, who in a day or two (on receiving a Courier from his own Court) ask'd the State's leave to apprehend him, but he was gone,
					&amp; arrived safe in St Mary-Ax,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1327tm" /> where he had lodgings (I fancy) at his old Friend La-Cour's,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1328tm" /> the Jew-Physician. after some days a Messenger took charge of him, &amp; he was examined (I believe),
					before Mr Pitt. they however dismissed him, but with orders to leave England directly, yet I know care was taken, that he should be
					furnish'd with proper passports to go safe thro' Holland to Hamb'rough: wch gives some room to believe, what many at first imagined,
					that he was charged with some proposal from the French Court. he is a likely Person enough to make them believe at Paris, that he could
					somehow serve them on such an occasion.</p>
				<p>We are in great alarms about Quebec.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1329tm" /> the force in the Town was not 3000 Men, sufficient to defend
					the place (naturally strong) against any attack of the French forces, unfurnish'd as they must be for a formal siege: but by no means
					to meet them in the field. this however is what Murray<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1330tm" /> has chose to do, whether from rashness, or
					deceived by false intelligence, I can not tell. the returns of our loss are undoubtedly false, for we have above 100 Officers kill'd or
					taken. all depends upon the arrival of our Garrison from Louïsbourg, wch was daily expected, but even that (unless they bring
					provisions with them) may increase the distress, for at the time, when we were told of the plenty &amp; cheapness of all things at
					Quebec, I am assured, a piece of fresh meat could not be had for 20 Guineas.</p>
				<p>If you have seen Stonhewer he has probably told you of my old Scotch (or rather Irish) Poetry. I am gone mad about them. they are
					said to be translations (literal &amp; in prose) from the <hi rend="italic">Erse</hi>-tongue,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1331tm" /> done by
					one Macpherson,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1332tm" /> a young Clergyman in the High-lands. he means to publish a Collection he has of these
					Specimens of antiquity, if it be antiquity: but what plagues me is, I can not come at any certainty on that head. I was so struck, so
						<hi rend="italic">extasié</hi> with their infinite beauty, that I writ into Scotland to make a thousand enquiries. the letters I have
					in return are ill-wrote, ill-reason'd, unsatisfactory, calculated (one would imagine) to deceive one, &amp; yet not cunning enough to
					do it cleverly. in short, the whole external evidence would make one believe these fragments (for so he calls them, tho' nothing can be
					more entire) counterfeit: but the internal is so strong on the other side, that I am resolved to believe them genuine, spite of the
					Devil &amp; the Kirk. it is impossible to convince me, that they were invented by the same Man, that writes me these letters. on the
					other hand it is almost as hard to suppose, if they are original, that he should be able to translate them so admirably. what can one
					do? since St:r went, I have received another of a very different &amp; inferior kind (being merely descriptive) much more modern than
					the former (he says) yet very old too; this too in it's way is extremely fine. in short this Man is the very Demon of Poetry, or he has
					lighted on a treasure hid for ages.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1333tm" /> the Welch Poets are also coming to light: I have seen a Discourse
					in Mss. about them (by one Mr Evans,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1334tm" /> a Clergyman) with specimens of their writings. this is in Latin,
					&amp;, tho' it don't approach the other, there are fine scraps among it.</p>
				<p>You will think I am grown mighty poetical of a sudden; you would think so still more, if you knew, there was a Satyr<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1335tm" /> printed against me &amp; Mason jointly. it is call'd <hi rend="italic">Two Odes:</hi> the one is inscribed
					to Obscurity (that is me) the other to Oblivion. it tells me what I never heard before, for (speaking of himself) the Author
						says,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1336tm" /> tho' he has</p>
				<q>
					<p>Nor the Pride, nor Self-Opinion, <lb /> That possess the happy Pair, <lb /> Each of Taste the fav'rite Minion, <lb /> Prancing thro'
						the desert air: <lb /> Yet shall he mount, with classick housings graced, <lb /> By help mechanick of equestrian block; <lb /> And all
						unheedful of the Critick's mock <lb /> Spur his light Courser o'er the bounds of Taste. </p>
				</q>
				<p>The writer is a Mr Coleman, who publish'd the <hi rend="italic">Connoisseur,</hi> nephew to the late Lady Bath, &amp; a Friend of
					Garrick's. I believe his Odes sell no more than mine did, for I saw a heap of them lie in a Bookseller's window, who recommended them
					to me as a very pretty thing.</p>
				<p>If I did not mention Tristram<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1337tm" /> to you, it was because I thought I had done so before. there is much
					good fun in it, &amp; humour sometimes hit &amp; sometimes mist. I agree with your opinion of it, &amp; shall see the two future
					volumes with pleasure. have you read his Sermons<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1338tm" /> (with his own comic figure at the head of them)?
					they are in the style I think most proper for the Pulpit, &amp; shew a very strong imagination &amp; a sensible heart: but you see him
					often tottering on the verge of laughter, &amp; ready to throw his perriwig in the face of his audience. now for my season.</p>

					<salute>Dear Old Soul </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I can not figure to myself what you should mean by <hi rend="italic">my old papers.</hi> I sent none. all I can make out is this.
					when I sent the Musæus and the Satyr<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1341tm" /> home to Mr Fraser, my Boy carried back the Conway-Papers<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1342tm" /> to a house in your street.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1343tm" /> as I remember, they were divided into three
					parcels, on the least of wch I had wrote the word <hi rend="italic">Nothing</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Of no consequence.</hi> it did
					not consist of above 20 letters at most, &amp; if you find any thing about Mr Bourne's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1344tm" /> affairs, or
					Steward's &amp; Servants letters &amp; bills, it is certainly so. this was carried to Mr Fraser by mistake, &amp; sent to Aston; and if
					this is the case, they may as well be burnt. but if there is a good number, &amp; about affairs of state (wch you may smell out) then
					it is one of the other parcels, &amp; I am distress'd, &amp; must find some method of getting it up again. I think I had inscribed the
					two packets, that signified any thing, one <hi rend="italic">Papers of Q: Elizabeth, or earlier,</hi> the other (wch was a great
					bundle) <hi rend="italic">Papers of K: James &amp; Charles 1st.</hi> pray heaven, it is neither of these: therefore don't be
					precipitate in burning.</p>
				<p>I do not like your improvements at Aston,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1345tm" /> it looks so like <hi rend="italic">settling</hi>: if I
					come, I will set fire to it. your policy &amp; your gratitude I approve, &amp; your determination never to quarrel, &amp; ever to pray:
					but I, that believe it want of power, am certainly civiller to a certain Person,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1346tm" /> than you, that call
					it want of exertion. I will never believe the [ ] ns are dead,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1347tm" /> tho' I smelt them; that sort of People
					always [live]<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1348tm" /> to a good old-age. I dare swear, they are only gone to Ireland, &amp; we shall soon
					hear they are Bishops.</p>
				<p>The bells are ringing, the Squibs bouncing. the Siege of Quebec is raised.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1349tm" /> Swanton<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1350tm" /> got up the river, when they were bombarding the Town. Murray made a sally, routed them &amp; took all their
					baggage. this is sum &amp; substance in the vulgar tongue, for I cannot get the Gazette till midnight. perhaps you have had an
						Estafette.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1351tm" /> since I find, their cannon are all taken, &amp; that two days after a French Fleet going
					to their assistance was intercepted, &amp; sunk or burnt.</p>
				<p>Tomorrow I go into Oxfordshire,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1352tm" /> &amp; a fortnight hence, when old Fobus's Owls-nest<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1353tm" /> is a little aired, I go into it.</p>

				<p>Though you have had but a melancholy employment, it is worthy of envy, and (I hope) will have all the success it deserves.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1356tm" /> It was the best and most natural method of cure, and such as could not have been administered by any but
					your gentle hand. I thank you for communicating to me what must give you so much satisfaction.</p>
				<p>I too was reading M. D'Alembert,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1357tm" /> and (like you) am totally disappointed in his Elements.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1358tm" /> I could only taste a little of the first course: it was dry as a stick, hard as a stone, and cold as a
					cucumber. But then the Letter to Rousseau<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1359tm" /> is like himself; and the Discourses on Elocution,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1360tm" /> and on the Liberty of Music,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1361tm" /> are divine. He has added to his translations
					from Tacitus;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1362tm" /> and (what is remarkable) though that Author's manner more nearly resembles the best
					French Writers of the present age, than any thing, he totally fails in the attempt. Is it his fault, or that of the language?</p>
				<p>I have received another Scotch packet<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1363tm" /> with a third specimen,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1364tm" />
					inferior in kind, (because it is merely description) but yet full of nature and noble wild imagination. Five Bards pass the night at
					the Castle of a Chief (himself a principal Bard); each goes out in his turn to observe the face of things, and returns with an
					extempore picture of the changes he has seen (it is an October night, the harvest-month of the Highlands). This is the whole plan; yet
					there is a contrivance, and a preparation of ideas, that you would not expect. The oddest thing is, that every one of them sees Ghosts
					(more or less). The idea, that struck and surprised me most, is the following. One of them (describing a storm of wind and rain) says <q>
						<p>Ghosts ride on the tempest to-night: <lb /> Sweet is their voice between the gusts of wind; <lb />
							<hi rend="italic">Their songs are of other worlds!</hi>
						</p>
					</q> Did you never observe (<hi rend="italic">while rocking winds are piping loud</hi>)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1365tm" /> that pause,
					as the gust is recollecting itself, and rising upon the ear in a shrill and plaintive note, like the swell of an Æolian harp? I do
					assure you there is nothing in the world so like the voice of a spirit. Thomson had an ear sometimes: he was not deaf to this; and has
					described it gloriously, but given it another different turn, and of more horrour. I cannot repeat the lines: it is in his
						Winter.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1366tm" /> There is another very fine picture in one of them. It describes the breaking of the clouds
					after the storm, before it is settled into a calm, and when the moon is seen by short intervals.</p>
				<q>
					<p>The waves are tumbling on the lake, <lb /> And lash the rocky sides. <lb /> The boat is brim-full in the cove, <lb /> The oars on
						the rocking tide. <lb /> Sad sits a maid beneath a cliff, <lb /> And eyes the rolling stream: <lb /> Her Lover promised to come,
						<lb /> She saw his boat (when it was evening) on the lake; <lb />
						<hi rend="italic">Are these his groans in the gale?</hi>
						<lb />
						<hi rend="italic">Is this his broken boat on the shore?</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1367tm" />

				<p>I guess what the packet<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1370tm" /> is, and desire you would keep it, for I am come back hither,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1371tm" /> and hope to be with you on Tuesday<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1372tm" /> night. I shall trouble you to have my

					hope there might be some garret vacant this summer time, and that he might lie within your walls; but this I leave to your
					consideration.</p>
				<p>This very night Billy Robinson<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1373tm" /> consummates his good fortune; she has £10,000 in her pocket, and a
					brother unmarried with at least as much more. He is infirm, and the first convoy that sails they all three set out together for Naples
					to pass a year or two. I insist upon it he owes all this to Mr. Talbot<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1374tm" /> in the first place, and in the
					second to me, and have insisted on a couple of thousand pounds between us&#x2013;the least penny&#x2013;or he is a shabby fellow.</p>
				<p>I ask pardon about Madame de Fuentes<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1375tm" /> and her twelve ladies. I heard it in good company, when first
					she arrived, piping hot; and I suppose it was rather what people apprehended than what they experienced. She surely brought them over,
					but I do not find she has carried them about; on the contrary, she calls on my Lady Hervey<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1376tm" /> in a
					morning in an undress, and desires to be without ceremony; and the whole tribe, except Madame de Mora<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1377tm" />
					(the young countess), were at Miss Chudleigh's ball<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1378tm" /> and many other places: but of late D'Abreu<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1379tm" /> (whom nobody ever liked) has advised them to be disagreeable, and they accept of no invitations.</p>

					<salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Your Packet,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1385tm" /> being directed to me here, lay some days in expectation of my arrival (for I did not
					come till about ten days since) so, if the letter inclosed to Dr Zachary Howlet<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1386tm" /> were not deliver'd so
					soon as it ought to have been, you must not lay the fault to my charge.</p>
				<p>It is a great misfortune, that I dare not present your new Seal<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1387tm" /> to the Senate in congregation
					assembled, as I long to do. not only the likeness, but the character, of the Fowl are so strongly marked, that I should wish it were
					executed in marble by way of Bas-Relief on the Pedestal of George the 2d, wch his Grace proposes soon to erect in the Theatre.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1388tm" /> Mr Brown &amp; I think we discover beauties, wch perhaps the Designer never intended. there is a brave
					little mitred Madge<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1389tm" /> already on the wing, who is flying, as it were, in the face of his Parent:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1390tm" /> this (we say) is Bp K:.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1391tm" /> then there is a second with ingratitude in its
					face, tho' not in its attitude, that will do the same, as soon as it is fledged, &amp; has the courage: this is Bp Y:.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1392tm" /> a third, that looks mighty modest, &amp; has two little ears sprouting, but no mitre yet, we take for Dean
						G:.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1393tm" /> the rest are Embryos, that have nothing distinguishing, &amp; only sit &amp; pule for a bit of
					mouse. they wont be Prebends these five days, grace of God, and if the Nest is not taken first. </p>
				<p>Your Friend Dr Ch:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1394tm" /> died of a looseness. about a week before, he eat five large mackarell, full of
					roe, to his own share: but what gave the finishing stroke was a Turbot on Trinity-Sunday,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1395tm" /> of wch he
					left but a very little for the company. of the mackarel I have eye-witnesses, so the turbot may well find credit. he has left (I am
					told) 15000£ behind him.</p>
				<p>The Erse Fragments have been publish'd five weeks ago in Scotland,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1396tm" /> tho' I had them not (by a
					mistake) till last week. as you tell me, new things do not soon reach you at Aston, I inclose what I can. the rest shall follow, when
					you tell me, whether you have not got it already. I send the two, wch I had before, for Mr Wood,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1397tm" />
					because he has not the <hi rend="italic">affectation of not admiring.</hi> I continue to think them genuine, tho' my reasons for
					believing the contrary are rather stronger than ever: but I will have them antique, for I never knew a Scotchman of my own time, that
					could read, much less write, poetry; &amp; such poetry too! I have one (from Mr Macpherson) wch he has not printed: it is mere
					description, but excellent too in its kind.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1398tm" /> if you are good, &amp; will learn to admire, I will
					transcribe it. pray send to Sheffield for the last Monthly Review; there is a deal of stuff about us, &amp; Mr. Coleman.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1399tm" /> it says, one of us <hi rend="italic">at least</hi> has always born his faculties meekly.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1400tm" /> I leave you to guess, wch that is: I think, I know. you Oaf you, you must be meek,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1401tm" /> must you? &amp; see, what you get by it!</p>
				<p>I thank you for your care of the old papers:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1402tm" /> they were entirely insignificant, as you
					suspected.</p>
				<p>Billy Robinson<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1403tm" /> has been married near a fortnight to a Miss Richardson (of his own age, he says,
					&amp; not handsome) with 10,000£ in her pocket. she lived with an (unmarried) infirm Brother, who (the first convoy that sails,) sets
					out with the Bride &amp; Bridegroom in his company for Naples. you see it is better to be Curate of Kensington than Rector of Aston. </p>
				<p>Ld J: C:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1404tm" /> call'd upon me here the other day. young Ponsonby,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1405tm" /> his
					Nephew, is to come this year to the University, &amp; as his Ldp (very justly) thinks, that almost every thing depends on the choice of
					a private Tutor, he desires me to look out for such a thing, but without engaging him to any thing. now I am extremely unacquainted
					with the younger part of Cambridge, &amp; consequently can only enquire of other people, &amp; (what is worse) have no body now here,
					whose judgement I could much rely on. in my own conscience I know no one I should sooner recommend than Onely,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1406tm" /> &amp; besides (I own) should wish to bring him to this College. yet I have scruples, first because I am
					afraid Onely should not answer my Ld's expectations (for what he is by way of a Scholar, I can not tell) &amp; next because the young
					Man (who is high-spirited &amp; unruly) may chance to be more than a match for Mr B:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1407tm" /> with whom the
					authority must be lodged. I have said, I would enquire, &amp; mean (if I could) to do so without partiality to any College: but
					believe, after all I shall find no better: now I perceive, you have said something to Ld J: already to the same purpose, therefore tell
					me, what I shall do in this case. if you chance to see his Lp, you need not mention it, unless he tell you himself, what has past
					between us.</p>

				<p>Not knowing whether you are yet returned from your seawater, I write at random to you. For me, I am come to my resting place, and
					find it very necessary, after living for a month in a house with three women<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1411tm" /> that laughed from
					morning to night, and would allow nothing to the sulkiness of my disposition. Company and cards at home, parties by land and water
						abroad,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1412tm" /> and (what they call) <hi rend="italic">doing something,</hi> that is, racketting about from
					morning to night, are occupations, I find, that wear out my spirits, especially in a situation where one might sit still, and be alone
					with pleasure; for the place was a hill like Clifden,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1413tm" /> opening to a very extensive and diversified
					landscape, with the Thames, which is navigable, running at its foot.</p>
				<p>I would wish to continue here (in a very different scene, it must be confessed) till Michaelmas; but I fear I must come to town much
					sooner. Cambridge is a delight of a place, now there is nobody in it. I do believe you would like it, if you knew what it was without
					inhabitants. It is they, I assure you, that get it an ill name and spoil all. Our friend Dr. Chapman<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1414tm" />
					(one of its nuisances) is not expected here again in a hurry. He is gone to his grave with five fine mackerel (large and full of roe)
					in his belly. He eat them all at one dinner; but his fate was a turbot<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1415tm" /> on Trinity Sunday, of which he
					left little for the company besides bones. He had not been hearty all the week; but after this sixth fish he never held up his head
					more, and a violent looseness carried him off. &#x2013; They say he made a very good end.</p>
				<p>Have you seen the Erse Fragments<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1416tm" /> since they were printed? I am more puzzled than ever about their
					antiquity, though I still incline (against everybody's opinion) to believe them old. Those you have already seen are the best; though
					there are some others that are excellent too. </p>

				<p>A Note </p>
				<p>Having made many enquiries about the authenticity of these Fragments;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1429tm" /> I have got a letter from Mr
					David Hume (the Historian) wch is more satisfactory than any thing I have yet met with on that subject. he says,</p>
				<p>Certain it is, that these poems are in every body's mouth in the High-lands, have been handed down from Father to Son, &amp; are of
					an age beyond all memory &amp; tradition. Adam Smith,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1430tm" /> the celebrated Professor in Glasgow, told me,
					that the Piper of the Argyleshire Militia repeated to him all those, wch Mr Macpherson has translated, &amp; many more of equal beauty.
					Major Mackay (Ld Rae's Brother)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1431tm" /> told me, that he remembers them perfectly well; as likewise did the
					Laird of Macfarline<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1432tm" /> (the greatest Antiquarian we have in this country) &amp; who insists strongly on
					the historical truth, as well as the poetical beauty of these productions. I could add the Laird &amp; Lady Macleod, with many more,
					that live in different parts of the highlands, very remote from each other, &amp; could only be acquainted with what had become (in a
					manner) national works. there is a Country-Surgeon in Lochaber, who has by heart the entire Epic Poem mention'd by Mr Macpherson in his
					Preface, &amp; as he is old; is perhaps the only person living, that knows it all; &amp; has never committed it to writing; we are in
					the more hast to recover a Monument, wch will certainly be regarded as a curiosity in the Republick of Letters: we have therefore set
					about a subscription of a Guinea or two Guineas apiece in order to enable Mr Macpherson to undertake a Mission into the Highlands to
					recover this poem, &amp; other fragments of antiquity.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1433tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I forgot to mention to you that the names of Fingal, Oscian, Oscur, &amp;c: are still given in the Highlands to large Mastiffs, as we
					give to ours the names of Cæsar, Pompey, Hector &amp;c: </p>

					<dateline>Cambr: Sept: 2. 1760. </dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>My Enquiries, &amp; the Information I am able to give you in consequence of them, are as follows: if they amount to but little, thank
					yourself for applying to a sucking Antiquary. </p>
				<p>Mr. Vertue's Mss<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1435tm" /> (as I do not doubt, you have experienced) will often put you on a false scent. be
					assured, that Occleve's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1436tm" /> portrait of Chaucer is not, nor ever was in St John's Library: they have a
					Mss of the Troilus &amp; Cressida without illuminations, &amp; no other part of his works. in the University Library indeed there is a
					large volume with most of his works on vellum, &amp; by way of frontispiece is (pasted in) a pretty old print<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1437tm" /> taken (as it says) by Mr Speed from Occleve's original painting in the <hi rend="italic">book De Regimine
						Principum.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1438tm" /> in the middle is Chaucer, a whole length; the same countenance, attitude, &amp; dress, that Vertue
					gives you in the two heads, wch he has engraved of him. the border is composed of escutcheons of arms, all the alliances of the Chaucer
					Family, &amp; at bottom the tomb of Thomas Chaucer &amp; Maud Burghersh at Ewelm.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1439tm" /> the print &amp; all
					the arms are neatly colour'd. I only describe this, because I never took notice of such a print any where else, tho' perhaps you may
					know it; for I suppose it was done for some of Speed's Works.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1440tm" /> about the painting I have a great
					puzzle in my head between Vertue, Mr. D'urry,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1441tm" /> &amp; Bishop Tanner.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1442tm" />
					Vertue (you know) has twice engraved Chaucer's head, once for D'urry's edition of his works, &amp; a second time in the Set of Poet's
					Heads. both are done from Occleve's painting: but he never tells us, where he found the painting, as he generally uses to do. D'urry
					says, there is a portrait of Chaucer (doubtless a whole length, for he describes his <hi rend="italic">port &amp; stature</hi> from
					it), in possession of <hi rend="italic">George Greenwood, Esq.</hi> of Chastleton in Gloucestershire. a little after he too mentions
					the picture by Occleve, but whether the same, or not, does not appear. Tanner in his Bibliotheca,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1443tm" />
					(Artic: Chaucer, see the notes) speaks of Occleve's painting too, but names another work of his (not the De Regim. Principum)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1444tm" /> &amp; adds, that it is in <hi rend="italic">the King's Library at Westminster</hi>: if so, you will
					certainly find it in the Museum, &amp; Casley's Catalogue<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1445tm" /> will direct you to the place.</p>
				<p>Of the Profile of Dr Keys<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1446tm" /> there is only a Copy in his College: but there is a Portrait of him (not
					in profile) a good picture, &amp; undoubtedly original, a half-figure upon board, dated Anno 1563, æt. suæ 53. There are 14 Latin
					verses inscribed on it, containing a character of him, as a Scholar &amp; excellent Physician, &amp; thus much more</p>
				<q>
					<p>Qui Cantabrigiæ Gonvilli incæpta minuta <lb /> auxit, &amp; e parvo nobile fecit opus; <lb /> Et qui Mausoleum Linacro donavit in
						æde, <lb /> quæ nunc de Pauli nomine nomen habet, &amp;c: <lb /> Talis erat Caius, qualem sub imaginis umbrâ <lb /> Pæne hic viventem
						picta tabella refert. </p>
				</q>
				<p>At the corners is written Vivit Virtus, &amp; Virtus Vivit, <hi rend="italic">but no Painter's name.</hi> in the same room hangs an
					old picture (very bad at first, &amp; now almost effaced by cleaning) of a Man in a slash'd doublet, dark curl'd hair &amp; beard,
					looking like a Foreigner, holding a pair of Compasses, &amp; by his side a Polyedron, made up of twelve pentagons. no name, or date.
					you will see presently, why I mention it.</p>
				<p>The Vice-Chancellor (Burroughs, Master of Keys)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1447tm" /> tells me he very well knew Vertue. that in a book
					belonging to the board of Works he had discover'd John of Padua<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1448tm" /> to be the architect of
					Somerset-house, &amp; had found that he likewise built Long-leat for Sr John Thynne.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1449tm" /> that it was from
					the similitude of style in those buildings, &amp; in the <hi rend="italic">four Gates</hi> of Keys-College, he had imagined the latter
					to be also the work of John of Padua, &amp; this was <hi rend="italic">all the proof</hi> he had of it. upon looking at these gates I
					plainly see, that they might very well be the work of one Man. from the College-books<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1450tm" /> I find, that
					the East-side, in wch are the <hi rend="italic">Portæ Virtutis &amp; Sapientiæ</hi>, was built in 1566, &amp; 1567. these are joined by
					two long walls to the <hi rend="italic">Porta Humilitatis,</hi> opening to the Street; &amp; in the two walls are two little Dorick
					frontis-pieces, leading into gardens. all these are (I dare say) of one time, &amp; shew the Roman Architecture reviving amongst us
					with little Columns &amp; Pilasters, well enough proportion'd in themselves, &amp; neatly executed, but in no proportion to the
					building they are meant to adorn. in the year 1575 are these words, <hi rend="italic">Porta</hi> (<hi rend="italic">quæ Honoris
						dicitur</hi>) <hi rend="italic">&amp; ad Scholas Publicas aperit</hi>) <hi rend="italic">a lapide quadrato duroqb </hi>
					<hi rend="italic">extruebatur, ad eam scilicet formam &amp; effigiem, quam Doctor Caius</hi> (<hi rend="italic">dum viveret</hi>) <hi
						rend="italic">Architecto præscripserat, elaborata.</hi> this is the Gate (more ornamented than the rest, but in the same style) wch
					you remember: it cost 128£. 9s. 5d. N:B: Dr Caius died July 29, 1573.</p>
				<p>In the same year, 1575, are these words: <hi rend="italic">Positum est Joh: Caio ex alabastro monumentum summi decoris &amp;
						artificii eodem in sacelli loco, quo corpus ejus antea sepeliebatur: cui præter insculpta illius insignia &amp; annotatum ætatis
						obitusqb </hi>

						tantummodo sententias has inscripsimus, Vivit post funera Virtus &#x2013; Fui Caius.</hi> this Monument (made to stand upon the
					ground, but now raised a great deal above the eye on a heavy ugly base projecting from the wall) is a Sarcophagus with rib'd work &amp;
					mouldings (somewhat antique) placed on a basement, supporting pretty large Corinthian columns of fine Alabaster, wch bear up an
					intablature, &amp; form a sort of canopy over it. the Capitals are gilt, &amp; the upper part both gilt &amp; painted with ugly scrolls
					&amp; compartments, <hi rend="italic">à l'Elisabet</hi>; the rest is simple and well enough.</p>

				<p>This column is now destroy'd, with all its sun-dials. but when Loggan<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1451tm" /> did his views of the
					colleges, the Pillar (tho' not the Dials) was still standing.</p>
				<p>From all this I draw, that Theodore Haveus of Cleves, the Architect, Sculptor, Painter, &amp; Diallist, did probably build the Porta
					Honoris (if not all the others)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1452tm" /> &amp; having work'd many years for Dr Caius &amp; the College, in

				<p>In the Gallery at Emanuel are several pictures<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1454tm" /> worth remarking, but not one name of a Painter to be

				<p>1. Archb:p Cranmer, head &amp; hands (on board) in his tippet of martens, &amp; seal-ring of his arms, æt: 57. </p>

					hand, pale &amp; old. 1588. tolerably well done.</p>
				<p>3. Sir Antony Mildmay,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1456tm" /> (his Son) 1596. whole length, doublet of gold tissue, black cloak, many
					jewels, high-crown'd hat hanging on a chair, armour lying on the floor, &amp; a fine damask'd long pistol. letters on a table directed
					to hir Majestie's Ambassador. a carpet mightily finish'd.</p>
				<p>4. Mrs Joyce Franklin, (a Benefactress)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1457tm" /> jolly woman above 40 with an enamel'd watch open in her
					hand. no date, dress of about Q: Mary's time. a head &amp; hands. </p>
				<p>5. Dr Hall,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1458tm" /> Bishop of Exeter, the great gold medal (representing the Synod of Dort) hanging in a
					chain about his neck. a head miserably done.</p>
				<p>6. <hi rend="italic">Effig: Rodulphi Simons,</hi>

				<p>In St John's Library is what I take for the original of Lady Margaret,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1460tm" /> kneeling at her oratory
					under a state. it is hung at a great height, &amp; spoil'd by damp &amp; neglect, while the Master keeps very choicely in his Lodge a

					Keeper) standing, &amp; <hi rend="italic">a carpet</hi> in it finish'd with great care; perhaps therefore by the same hand with that of
					Sr Ant: Mildmay. in the lodge is a very good old Picture, that used to be call'd Bp Fisher,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1462tm" /> but Dr

					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1464tm" /> what his reasons are, I can not tell, as he is not here: 'tis surely of Henry 8ths time, &amp; a
					Layman; on a board split from top to bottom.</p>
				<p>I sympathise with your Gout: it would be strange if I did not, with so many internal monitors as I carry about me, that hourly bid me
					expect it myself this autumn. yet it frights me to hear of <hi rend="italic">both feet.</hi> what did you do, &amp; in the night too,
					wch one foot only can make of equal duration with a night in Greenland?</p>
				<p>I thank you for your anecdote about Sr W:r Raleigh,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1465tm" /> wch is very extraordinary.</p>
				<p>What do you think of the Erse-Poems, now they are come out? I suppose your suspicions are augmented: yet (upon some farther enquiries
					I have made) Mr D:d Hume (the Historian) writes word,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1466tm" /> that 'their authenticity is beyond all
					question; that Adam Smith, the celebrated Professor at Glasgow, has assured him (who doubted too) that he had heard the <hi
						rend="italic">Piper of the Argyleshire militia</hi> repeat all these &amp; many more of equal beauty. that Major Mackay, the Laird
					&amp; Lady of Macleod, &amp; the Laird of Macfarline, the greatest Antiquarian in all their country, &amp; others, who live in the
					Highlands very remote from each other, remember them perfectly well, &amp; could not be acquainted with them, if they were not spread
					into every one's mouth there, &amp; become in a manner national works.' this is certainly the only proof, that works preserved merely
					by tradition, &amp; not in Manuscript, will admitt of.</p>
				<p>Adieu, I have done at last. oh no! my defence of Sr T: Wyat<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1467tm" /> is much at your service, but as it was
					the first thing I transcribed (when I was little versed in old hands) there probably may be mistakes, wch I could correct by comparing
					it with the Mss, were I in Town. I have also four long letters of his to the King (while he was Embassador)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1468tm" /> but, I doubt, you will scarce think them worth printing, as they contain no very remarkable facts, yet they
					help to shew the spirit, vigilance, &amp; activity of the Man.</p>
				<p>Look in Casley's Catalogue of the King's Library<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1469tm" /> at 17. D. 4to. VI. 1. &amp; you will find the Mss
					of Occleve &amp; Painting of Chaucer.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1470tm" />

					<salute>Dear Doctor</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Don't be afraid of me: I will not come, till you tell me, I may: tho' I long very much to see you. I hear, you have let your hair
						grow,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1472tm" /> &amp; visit none of your neighbouring gentry, two (I should think) capital crimes in that
					county, &amp; indeed in all counties. I hear too (&amp; rejoice) that you have recover'd your hearing. I have nothing equally important
					to tell you of myself, but that I have not had the Gout, since I saw you: yet don't let me brag; the winter is but just begun.</p>
				<p>I have pass'd a part of the summer on a charming hill near Henley<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1473tm" /> with the Thames running at my
					foot; but in the company of a pack of Women, that wore my spirits, tho' not their own. the rest of the season I was at Cambridge in a
					duller, &amp; more congenial, situation. did I tell you, that our Friend Chapman,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1474tm" /> a week before he
					died, eat five huge mackrell (fat &amp; full of roe) at one dinner, wch produced an indigestion: but on Trinity-Sunday he finish'd
					himself with the best part of a large Turbot, wch he carried to his grave, poor Man! he never held up his head after. from Cambridge I
					am come hither, yet am going into Kent<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1475tm" /> for a fortnight, or so. you astonish me in wondring, that my
					Lady C: left me nothing. for my part I wonder'd to find, she had given me 20£ for a ring;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1476tm" /> as much as
					she gave to several of her own Nieces. the World said before her death, that Mrs Sp:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1477tm" /> &amp; I had shut
					ourselves up with her in order to make her Will, &amp; that afterwards we were to be married.</p>
				<p>There is a second Edition of the Scotch Fragments,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1478tm" /> yet very few admire them, &amp; almost all take
					them for fictions. I have a letter from D: Hume,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1479tm" /> the Historian, that asserts them to be genuine,
					&amp; cites the names of several People (that know both languages) who have heard them current in the mouths of Pipers &amp; other
					illiterate persons in various &amp; distant parts of the Highlands. there is a subscription for Mr Macpherson, wch will enable him to
					undertake a mission among the Mountaineers, &amp; pick up all the scatter'd remnants of old poetry. he is certainly an admirable Judge;
					if his <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> Friends do not pervert, or over-rule his taste.</p>
				<p>Mason is here in Town, but so dissipated with his duties at Sion-Hill,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1480tm" /> or his attention to the
					Beaux Arts, that I see but little of him. the last spring (for the first time) there was an Exhibition<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1481tm"
					 /> in a publick-room of pictures, sculptures, engravings, &amp;c: sent in by all the Artists in imitation of what has been long
					practised at Paris.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1482tm" /> among the rest there is a Mr Sandby,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1483tm" /> who
					excells in Landscape, with figures, Views of Buildings, Ruins, &amp;c: &amp; has been much employ'd by the Duke,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1484tm" /> Ld Harcourt,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1485tm" /> Ld Scarborough,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1486tm" /> &amp;
					others. hitherto he has dealt in wash'd Drawings &amp; Water-Colours, but has of late only practised in oil. he (&amp; Mason together)
					have cook'd up a great picture of M: Snowdon, in wch the Bard &amp; Edward the first make their appearance; and this is to be his <hi
						rend="italic">Exhibition-Picture</hi> for next year,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1487tm" /> but (till then) it is a sort of secret.</p>
				<p>The great Expedition<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1488tm" /> takes up every body's thoughts. there is such a train of artillery on board,
					as never was seen before during this war. some talk of Brest, others of Rochefort. if the wind (wch is very high) does not blow it
					away, I do believe, it will succeed, for the French seem in a miserable way.</p>
				<p>The Duke is well-recover'd of his paralytic attack,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1489tm" /> tho' it is still visible in his face, when he
					speaks. it has been occasion'd by the long intermission of his usual violent exercises, for he can not ride, or walk much now on
					account of a dropsy confined <hi rend="italic">to a certain part,</hi> &amp; not dangerous in itself. yet he appears at NewMarket, but
					in his Chaise.</p>
				<p>Mason &amp; Mr Brown<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1490tm" /> send their best services. Dr Heberden enquires <hi rend="italic">kindly</hi>
					after you, &amp; has his good dinners as usual.</p>

					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I am obliged to you for your Letter, &amp; the Bills<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1492tm" /> enclosed, wch I shall take the first
					opportunity I have to satisfy.</p>
				<p>I imagine by this time Ld J:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1493tm" /> is, or has been, with you to settle matters. Mr Onley<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1494tm" /> (from whom I have twice heard) consents, tho' with great diffidence of himself, to undertake this task: but
					can not well be there himself, till about the 13th of Nov:r.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1495tm" /> I would gladly hear, what your first
					impressions are of the young Man, for (I must tell you plainly) our M:n, who had seen him at Chatsworth,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1496tm"
					 /> was not greatly edified, but he hopes the best. tomorrow Dr Gisborne<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1497tm" /> &amp; I go to dine with that
					reverend Gentleman at Kensington during his waiting. he makes many kind enquiries after you, but I see very little of him, he is so
					taken up with the Beaux-Arts. he has lately etch'd my head with his own hand;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1498tm" /> &amp; his friend Mr
					Sandby, the Landscape-Painter, is doing a great picture with a view of M: Snowdon, the Bard, Edward the first, &amp;c:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1499tm" /> now all this I take for a Bribe, a sort of Hush-money to me, who caught him last year sitting for his own
						picture;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1500tm" /> &amp; know, that at this time, there is another Painter doing one of the scenes in
					Elfrida.</p>
				<p>In my way to Town<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1501tm" /> I met with the first news of the expedition from Sr Wm Williams,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1502tm" /> who makes a part of it, &amp; perhaps may lay his fine Vandyke-Head in the dust. they talk some of
					Rochefort, some of Brest, &amp; others of Calais. it is sure the preparations are great, but the wind blows violently. </p>
				<p>You hear a great deal of a murther said to be committed at a Bagnio in Long Acre, tho' the party was carried to die at a house in
					Mary-bone. two of the Persons named as <hi rend="italic">of the company</hi> that night are Sir William Fowler, a young Officer, &amp;
					one Mr Sutton, a Merchant's Son in the City. God knows, what truth there is in it or what was the meaning of it. [ ] is said to be he,
					[ ] was hanged up by [ ] in a silken-rope, &amp; so left hanging, but the W(a)iter cut him down; &amp; that all this happened the same
						night.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1503tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Here is a 2d Edition of the Fragments<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1504tm" /> with a new &amp; fine one added to them. you will perhaps
					soon see a very serious elegy (but this is a secret) on the death of my Lady Coventry.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1505tm" /> watch for
					it.</p>
				<p>If I had been aware, Mr Mapletoft<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1506tm" /> was in Town, I should have return'd him the two Guineas I have of
					his. neither Osborne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1507tm" /> nor Bathurst know, when the Book<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1508tm" /> will come
					out; I will therefore pay it to any one he pleases.</p>

				<p>You will wonder at another letter so soon. it is only to tell you, what you will probably hear before this letter reaches you. </p>
				<p>The King is dead.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1511tm" /> he rose this morning about six (his usual early hour) in perfect health, &amp;
					had his chocolate .. between seven &amp; eight an unaccountable noise was heard in his chamber: they ran in, &amp; found him lying on
					the floor; he was directly bloodied, &amp; a few drops came from him, but he instantly expired.</p>
				<p>This event happens at an unlucky time, but (I should think) will make little alteration in publick measures. </p>
				<p>I am rather glad of the alteration with regard to Chambers<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1512tm" /> for a reason, wch you will guess at.</p>
				<p>My Service to Pa:; I will write to him soon, &amp; long to see his Manuscripts, &amp; blew books, &amp; precipices.<anchor

				<p>You will excuse me, if I write you a little news in this busy time, tho' I have nothing else to write. the Ladies are rejoiced to
					hear, they may probably have a marriage before the Coronation, wch will restore to that pomp all the beauties it would otherwise have
					lost. I hear (but this is <hi rend="italic">sub sigillo</hi>) no very extraordinary account of the<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1524tm" />
					P:ss of Saxe-Gotha,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1525tm" /> either as to her person, or temper. I never saw a face of <hi rend="italic">less
						sorrow</hi> than on the late <hi rend="italic">occasion.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1526tm" />
					<hi rend="italic">I do not blame</hi> the inhabitants of a certain great House<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1527tm" /> for not putting on
					that appearance: it would look like affectation. but even the old Servants, &amp; Friends appear insensible, &amp; he<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1528tm" /> is already, as if he never had been. one Person<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1529tm" /> however has behaved with
						<hi rend="italic">firmness</hi> &amp; yet great decency. he walks (at his own desire) Chief Mourner at the solemnity on
						Tuesday,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1530tm" /> &amp; supposing even the spectacle itself did not touch him, yet it must do so on
					reflection, that he may himself be probably the next that enters that gloomy place,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1531tm2" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1531tm1" /> which is far from unlikely.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1531tm" /> M:n<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1532tm" />
					walks in the same procession, &amp; as you possibly may see him the next day, he will give you the best account of it. you have heard
					(I suppose) that there are two Wills<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1533tm" /> (not duplicates). he had given to the D:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1534tm" /> all his jewels, but at the last going to H:r<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1535tm" /> had taken with him all the
					best of them, &amp; made them Crown-Jewels, so that they come to the Successor. he had also given the D: three Millions of Rix-Dollars
					in money, but in the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> will (made since the affair at <hi rend="italic">Closter-Seven</hi>)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1536tm" /> after an apology to him, as the best Son, that ever lived, &amp; <hi rend="italic">one, that has never
						offended him,</hi> declares, that the expences of the war have consumed all this money. he gives him (&amp; had before done so by a
					deed of gift) all his mortgages in Germany valued at 170,000£, but the French are in possession of part of these lands, &amp; the rest
					are devoured by the war. he gives to Pss Emily,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1537tm" /> &amp; Mary,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1538tm" /> about
					37000£ between them, the Survivor to take the whole (I have heard, that the D: was to have a third of this, but has given up his share
					to his Sisters). to Lady Y:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1539tm" /> a Box, wch is said to have in it 10,000£ in notes. the K: is residuary
					Legatee; what that amounts to, no one will know; &amp; consequently it must remain a doubt, whether he died rich or poor: I incline to
					believe rather the latter, I mean, in comparison of what was expected.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1540tm" />
				</p>
				<p>The Archbishop<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1541tm" /> is the most assiduous of Courtiers, standing for ever upright in the midst of a
					thousand Ladies. the other day he trod on the toes of the D:, who turned to him (for he made no sort of excuse) &amp; said aloud, If
					your G: is so eager to make your court, that is the way (pointing towards the King) &amp; then to the Count de Fuentes,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1542tm" /> You see, Priests are the same in this country as in yours.</p>
				<p>Mr E: Finch (your Representative)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1543tm" /> has got the place that Sr H: E:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1544tm" />
					(my Friend) had, Surveyor (I think) of the Roads, wch is about 600£ a-year. what then (you will ask) is become of my Friend? oh, he is
					a vast Favourite, is restored to his Regiment, &amp; made Groom of the Bed-Chamber. I have not been to see him yet, &amp; am
					half-afraid, for I hear, he has <hi rend="italic">a Levee.</hi> pray, don't tell.</p>
				<p>Ld J: C:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1545tm" /> is fix'd to come at his time in spite of the World. I hear within the year, you may expect
					a visit from his Majesty in person. the worst I can tell you is that Squit will be a B:p<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1546tm" />
				</p>
				<p>When the D: of Dev:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1547tm" /> introduced my Ld Mayor, he desired his Grace would be so kind to tell him, wch

				<p>V: 23. Cease, <hi rend="italic">cease, Luxuriant Muse;</hi> tho' mended, it is still weakly. I do not much care for any Muse at all

					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1560tm" />
				</p>
				<p>V: 98. <hi rend="italic">Truth ne'er can sanctify</hi> &#x2013; is an indifferent line. both Mr Brown &amp; I have some doubt about
					the justness of this sentiment. a Kingdom is purchased (we think) too dear with the life of any Man; &amp; this no less, if there <hi

				<p>I am sorry you went so soon out of Town, because you lost your share in his Majesty's reproof to his Chaplains. 'I desire, <hi

					great hopes of the young Man. Fobus was asking him, what Sum it was his pleasure should be laid out on the next Election? Nothing, my

					<salute>Dear Mr Gray</salute>
				</opener>
				<p> I thank you much for your Criticisms But at present shall not take notice of them. They will stand me in good stead whenever I put
					the Elegy in my just<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1581tm" /> volume and till then let them pass.</p>
				<p>I thank you also very much for Your Georgiana. if they be genuine I thank you as an Englishman; and prefer them before evry thing
					that ever ended in Ana; but you are mistaken in your Preacher, it was Dr Thomas Wilson<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1582tm" /> of
					Westminster, who they say is a Rogue, the other is only a Coxcomb, but a sort of Coxcomb that I hate almost as much as a Rogue.</p>
				<p>If the nouvelle Eloise<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1583tm" /> be Rousseaus, pity me because I live at Aston, &amp; have not seen it, &amp;
					be sure send me some account of it and that with speed. I find there is a new report that Ld H<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1584tm" /> is to
					go to Ireland this has inducd poor Fred: Hervey<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1585tm" /> (glad of such an opportunity of renewing our
					Correspondence) to write to me, &amp; to tell me that His Friends have hopes of making him first Chaplain, but that he begs first to
					know whether it will interfere with me &amp; whether it might not be made compatible with my interest, all this was so Jellied over
					with Friendship that he thought I fancy I should scarce know the Dish he presented me with. The letter I shall tye up in a Bundle with
					one of Archbishop Huttons<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1586tm" /> &amp; some others wch I keep as Curiositys in their way, I have however in
					pity to his Wife &amp; family of small Children<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1587tm" /> sent him an answer not so tart as he deservd, &amp;
					given him full liberty of useing all his interest in this matter. However Keep this a Secret because I promisd to do it &amp; because
					also I should not have broke my promise could I have thought of any thing better to write at present.</p>
				<p>I am glad at Heart to find this annihilation of Toryism, wch you give me an acct of. Fobus, besides Lying, had only one other
					ministerial Art in his possession wch too was a Species of Lying, And this he exerted in making evry Man who was not a friend to the
					Ministry a Tory. Was he askd to explain this? he had not skill enough in English History &amp; the constitution of his country to do
					it; &amp; therefore he explaind himself by saying a Tory was a Jacobite, &amp; a Jacobite a Tory. Thus you may remember one of his
					tools who could not cleverly make you either Tory or Jacobite said you was worse you was a Republican.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1588tm"
					 /> May God send this measure a happy ending, &amp; may the next Generation be only distinguishd by the style &amp; title of Friends to
					their Country.</p>
				<p>You have by this time heard Elisi<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1589tm" /> pray give me an account of him or it as soon as possible &amp;
					send me also your Recipe for Chevichi,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1590tm" /> in plain terms.</p>
				<p>Have you made up your mind about Gothic Architecture &amp; consequently given over Your Genealogical Studies<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1591tm" /> wch it seems are so intimately connected with that Science. for my part I am metamorphosing some good Old
					Homilies into new-fashiond Sermons &amp; consequently spoiling every period of them. But what better can I do, living as I here do in
					almost absolute solitude, &amp; in that state of Life wch My old Friend Jeremy Taylor so well describes in his Sermon aptly entituled
					the Marriage ring.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1592tm" /> 'Celibate Life (sayth he) like the <hi rend="italic">Flie</hi> in the <hi
						rend="italic">heart of an Apple dwells in a perpetual sweetness,</hi> but sits alone, &amp; is confind, and <hi rend="italic">dies in
						singularity,</hi> but Marriage like the useful Bee builds a house gathers sweetness from evry flowr labors and unites into Societys
					&amp; republics &amp;c.' If I survive You, &amp; come to publish your Works, I shall quote this passage, from whence you so evidently
					(without ever seeing it) took that thought <hi rend="italic">Poor Moralist, and what art thou,</hi> &amp;c.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1593tm" /> But the Plagiarism had been too glaring had you taken <hi rend="italic">the heart of the Apple</hi> In wch
					however the great beauty of the thought consists. After all why will you not read Jeremy Taylor? take my word once more for it he is
					the Shakespeare of Divines.</p>

					<salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I am delighted with F: H:s<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1595tm" /> letter, &amp; envy you his friendship: for the foundation of it (I am
					persuaded) was pure friendship, as far as his Idea of the thing extended, &amp; if one could see his little heart, one should find no
					vanity there for over-reaching you, &amp; artfully gilding so dirty a pill; but only a degree of self-applause for having done one of
					the genteelest &amp; handsomest things in the world. I long to see the originals, &amp; (if you have any gratitude) you will publish
					them in your just<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1596tm" /> volume. alas! there was a time, when he was my Friend, &amp; there was a time (he
					own'd) when he had been my greatest Enemy. why did I lose both one &amp; the other of these advantages, when at present I could be so
					happy with either, I care not which? tell him, he may take his choice. it is not from interest I say this, tho' I know he will some
					time or other be Earl of B:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1597tm" /> but purely because I have long been without a Knave &amp; Fool of my
					own. here is a Bishoprick (St Davids) vacant.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1598tm" /> can I any how serve him? I hear Dr Ayscough<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1599tm" /> &amp; Dean Squire<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1600tm" /> are his Competitors. God knows, who will go to
						Ireland:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1601tm" /> it ought to be <hi rend="italic">somebody,</hi> for there is a prodigious <hi rend="italic"
						>to-do</hi> there. the cause I have been told, but as I did not understand or attend to it, no wonder if I forgot it. it is somewhat
					about a Money-bill:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1602tm" /> perhaps you may know. the Lords-Justices absolutely refuse to comply with what
					the Government here do insist upon, &amp; even offer to resign their posts. in the mean time none of the Pensions on that establishment
					are paid. nevertheless two such pensions have been bestow'd within this few weeks, one on your Friend Mrs Anne Pitt<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1603tm" /> (of 500£ a-year) wch she ask'd, &amp; Ld B:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1604tm" /> got it done immediately: she
					keeps her place with it. the other (of 400£) to Lady Harry Beauclerc,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1605tm" /> whose Husband died suddenly,
					&amp; left her with six or seven children very poorly provided for. the grant was sent her without being asked at all by herself, or
					any Friend. I have done with my news, because I am told, that there is an <hi rend="italic">Express</hi> just set out for Yorkshire,
					whom you are to meet on the road. I hope, you will not fail to inform him,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1606tm" /> who is to be his first
					Chaplain. perhaps you will think it a piece of treachery to do so; or perhaps you will leave the thing to itself in order to make an
					experiment.</p>
				<p>I can not pity you: au contraire I wish I had been at Aston, when I was foolish enough to go thro' the six volumes of the <hi
						rend="italic">Nouvelle Eloïse.</hi> all I can say for myself is, that I was confined for three weeks at home by a severe cold, &amp;
					had nothing better to do. there is no one event in it, that might not happen any day of the week (separately taken) in any private
					family. yet these events are so put together, that the series of them is more absurd &amp; more improbable than Amadis de Gaul.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1607tm" /> the Dramatis Personæ (as the Author says) are all of them good Characters. I am sorry to hear it, for had
					they been all hang'd at the end of the 3d volume, no body (I believe) would have cared. in short I went on &amp; on in hopes of finding
					some wonderful <hi rend="italic">denouement</hi> that would set all right, &amp; bring something like Nature &amp; Interest out of
					absurdity &amp; insipidity. no such thing: it grows worse &amp; worse, &amp; (if it be Rousseau, wch is not doubted) is the strongest
					instance I ever saw, that a very extraordinary Man may entirely mistake his own talents.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1608tm" /> by the
						Motto<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1609tm" /> &amp; Preface it appears to be his own story, or something similar to it.</p>
				<p>The Opera House is crowded this year like any ordinary Theatre. Elisi<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1610tm" /> is finer than any thing, that
					has been here in your memory: yet, as I suspect, has been finer than he is. he appears to be near forty, a little pot-bellied &amp;
					thick-shoulder'd, otherwise no bad figure; his action proper &amp; not ungraceful. we have heard nothing, since I remember Operas, but
					eternal passages, divisions, &amp; flights of execution. of these he has absolutely none, whether merely from judgement, or a little
					from age, I will not affirm. his point is expression, &amp; to that all the graces, &amp; ornaments he inserts (wch are few &amp;
					short) are evidently directed. he goes higher (they say) than Farinelli,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1611tm" /> but then this celestial note
					you do not hear above once in a whole Opera; &amp; he falls from this altitude at once to the mellowest, softest, strongest tones
					(about the middle of his compass) that can be heard. the Mattei<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1612tm" /> (I assure you) is much improved by
					his example, &amp; by her great success, this winter. but then the Burlettas, &amp; the Paganina<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1613tm" />
					&#x2013; I have not been so pleased with any thing these many years. she too is fat, &amp; about forty, yet handsome withall, &amp; has
					a face, that speaks the language of all nations. she has not the invention, the fire, &amp; the variety of action, that the
						Spiletta<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1614tm" /> had, yet she is light, agile, ever in motion, &amp; above all graceful: but then her voice,
					her ear, her taste in singing! good God &#x2013; as Mr Richardson<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1615tm" /> the painter says. pray, ask my
						Lord,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1616tm" /> for I think I have seen him there once or twice, as much pleased as I was.</p>
				<p>I have long thought of reading Jeremy Taylor, for I am persuaded, that chopping Logick in the Pulpit, as our Divines have done
					eversince the Revolution, is not the thing; but that Imagination &amp; Warmth of expression, are in their place there as much as on the
					Stage, moderated however &amp; chastised a little by the purity &amp; severity of Religion. </p>
				<p>I send you my Receipt for <hi rend="italic">Caviche</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1617tm" /> (Heaven knows, against my conscience) pray, Doctor, will the weakness of one's appetite justify the
					use of provocatives? in a few years (I suppose) you will desire my receipt for Tincture of Cantharides! I do this the more unwillingly,
					because I am sensible, that any Man is rich enough to be an Epicure, when he has nobody to entertain but himself. </p>

				<p>You seem to forget me: if it were for any other reason, than that you are very busy, that is, very happy, I should not so easily pass
					it over.</p>
				<p>I send you a Swedish &amp; English Calendar. the first Column is by Berger,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1619tm" /> a Disciple of
						Linnæus;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1620tm" /> the 2d by Mr Stillingfleet,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1621tm" /> the 3d (very imperfect
					indeed) by me. you are to observe, as you tend your plantations &amp; take your walks, how the Spring advances in the North, &amp;
					whether Old-Park most resembles Upsal, or Stratton.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1622tm" /> this latter has on one side a barren black heath,
					on the other a light sandy loam; all the country about it is a dead flat. you see, it is necessary you should know the situation (I do
					not mean any reflection upon any body's place) &amp; this is Mr. Stillingfleet's description of his Friend Mr Marsham's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1623tm" /> Seat, to wch in summer he retires, &amp; botanizes. I have lately made an acquaintance with this
					Philosopher, who lives in a garret here in the winter, that he may support some near relations, who depend upon him. he is always
					employ'd, &amp; always chearful, &amp; seems to me a very worthy honest Man. his present scheme is to send some Persons properly
					qualified to reside a year or two in Attica to make themselves acquainted with the climate, productions, &amp; natural history of the
					country, that we may understand Aristotle &amp; Theophrastus,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1624tm" /> &amp;c: who have been heathen-Greek to
					us for so many ages. this he has got proposed to Ld Bute, who is no unlikely Person to put it in execution, being himself a Botanist,
					&amp; having now in the press a new System of Botany of his own writing in several volumes,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1625tm" /> the
					profits of wch he gives to Dr Hill<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1626tm" /> (the Inspector) who has lately got the place of Master-Gardiner at
					Kensington, reckon'd worth near 2000£ a-year. there is an odd thing for you!</p>
				<p>One hears nothing of the K:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1627tm3" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1627tm2" /> but what gives one the best opinion of him imaginable: I hope, it may hold. the R: F:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1627tm1" /> run loose about the world, &amp; people do not know how to treat them, nor they how to be treated. they
					visit &amp; are visited: some come to the Street-door to receive them, &amp; that, they say, is too much: others to the head of the
					stairs, &amp; that they think too little. no body sits down with them, not even in their own house, unless at a card-table, so the
					world are like to grow very weary of the honour. none but the D: of Y:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1627tm" /> enjoy themselves (you know, he
					always did) but the world seems weary of this honour too, for a different reason. I have just heard no bad story of him. when he was at
					Southampton in the summer, there was a Clergyman in the neighbourhood with two very handsome daughters. he had soon wind of them, &amp;
					drop'd in for some reason or other, came again &amp; again, &amp; grew familiar enough to eat a bone of their mutton. at last he said
					to the Father, Miss &#x2014; lead a mighty confined life here always at home, why can't you let one of them go, &amp; take an airing
					now and then with me in my chaise? Ah! Sr (says the Parson) do but look at them, a couple of hale fresh-colour'd hearty Wenches! they
					need no airing, they are well-enough: but there is their Mother, poor Woman, has been in a declining way many years. if your R: H:
					would give her an airing now &amp; then, it would be doing us a great kindness indeed!</p>
				<p>You see, old Wortley-Montagu<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1628tm" /> is dead at last at 83. it was not mere avarice, &amp; its companion,
					abstinence, that kept him alive so long. he every day drank (I think, it was) half a pint of Tokay,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1629tm" />
					wch he imported himself from Hungary in greater quantity than he could use, &amp; sold the Overplus for any price he chose to set upon
					it. he has left better than half a million of money: to Lady Mary 1200£ a-year, in case she gives up her pretensions to dowry; &amp; if
					not, it comes to his Son.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1630tm" /> to the same Son 1000£ per an: for life only,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1631tm"
					 /> &amp; after him to his Daughter, Lady Bute. (now this Son is about 80,000£ in debt) to all Lady Bute's Children, which are eleven,
					2000£ a-piece. <hi rend="italic">all the remainder</hi> to Lady Bute, &amp; after her to her second Son,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1632tm"
					 /> who takes the name of Wortley, &amp; (if he fail) to the next in order; &amp; after all these &amp; their Children to Ld
						Sandwich,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1633tm" /> to whom <hi rend="italic">in present</hi> he leaves some old Manuscripts. now I must tell
					you a story of Lady Mary. as she was on her travels, she had occasion to go somewhere by sea, &amp; (to save charges) got a passage on
					board a Man of War: the ship was (I think) Commodore Barnet's.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1634tm" /> when he had landed her, she told him,
					she knew she was not to offer to pay for her passage, but in consideration of his many civilities entreated him to wear a ring for her
					sake, &amp; press'd him to accept it, wch he did. it was an emerald of remarkable size &amp; beauty. some time after, as he wore it,
					some Friend was admiring it, &amp; asking how he came by it. when he heard from whom it came, he laugh'd &amp; desired him to shew it
					to a Jeweller, whom he knew. the Man was sent for: he unset it; it was a paste not worth 40 shillings.</p>
				<p>The Ministry are much out of joint. Mr P:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1635tm" /> much out of humour, his popularity tottering, chiefly
					occasion'd by a Pamphlet against the German War, written by that <hi rend="italic">squeaking</hi> acquaintance of ours, Mr.
						Mauduit:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1636tm" /> it has had a vast run. the Irish are very intractable, even the Lds J:s themselves;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1637tm" /> great difficulties about who shall be sent over to tame them: my Ld H:ss<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1638tm" />
					again named, but (I am told) has refused it. every body waits for a new Parliament to settle their ideas.</p>
				<p>I have had no gout, since you went: I will not brag, lest it return with redoubled violence. I am very foolish, &amp; do nothing to
					mark, that I ever was: I am going to C:ge<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1639tm" /> to take the <hi rend="italic">fresh air</hi> this fine
					winter for a month or so. we have had snow one day this winter, but it did not lie: it was several months ago. the 18th of Jan: I took
					a walk to <hi rend="italic">Kentish-Town,</hi> wind N: W:, bright &amp; frosty. Therm: at Noon was at 42. the grass remarkably green
					&amp; flourishing. I observed, on dry banks facing the South that Chickweed, Dandelion, Groundsel, Red Archangel,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1640tm" /> &amp; Shepherds-Purse were beginning to flower. this is all I know of the Country.</p>
				<p>My best compliments to Mrs Wharton. I hear her butter is the best in the Bishoprick, &amp; that even Deborah<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1641tm" /> has learn'd to spin. I rejoice you are all in health, but why are you deaf: &amp; blind too, or you could
					not vote for F: V:!<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1642tm" /> I have abundance more to say, but my paper won't hear of it.</p>

					</table>
					<p>Observe, from this Calendar it appears, that there is a wonderful difference between the earlier Phænomena of the Spring in Sweden
						&amp; in England, no less than 78 days in the flow'ring of the Snow-Drop, 61 days in the appearance of the Wagtail, 62 days in the
						bloom of the Lilac, 43 days in the leafing of the Oak, 40 days in the blooming of the Cherry-tree, 36 days in the singing of the
						Nightingale, 33 in the return of the Swallow, 25 in that of the Cuckow, &amp; so on. yet the Summer-flowers nearly keep time alike in
						both climates, the Harvest differs not a fortnight, some of the Fruits only 9 days; nay, strawberries come earlier there by 13 days,
						than with us. the Swallow stays with us only 4 days longer than with them, &amp; the Ashtree begins to lose its leaves within 3 days
						of the same time. these differences, &amp; these uniformities I know not how to account for. </p>
					<p>Mr Stillingfleet's Kalendar goes no farther than Oct: 26. but I observed, that, on Dec: 2, many of our Rosetrees had put out new
						leaves, and the Laurustine, Polyanthus, single yellow, &amp; bloody Wallflowers, Cytisus, &amp; scarlet Geranium were still in flower. </p>
					<p>Jan: 15. 1756. the Honeysuckles were in leaf, and single Hepatica &amp; Snowdrop in flower. </p>

					<dateline>London. Feb: 9. 1761. </dateline>
					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>If I have not sooner made answer to your kind enquiries, it has been owing to the uncertainty I was under as to my own motions. now
					at last I perceive I must stay here till March &amp; part of April are over,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1644tm" /> so I have accommodated
					myself to it, &amp; perhaps it may be better to come, when your Codlin-Hedge<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1645tm" /> is in bloom than at this
					dull season. my cold, wch Mr Bickham<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1646tm" /> told you of, kept me at home above three weeks, being at first
					accompanied with a slight fever: but at present I am marvellous: not a word of the Gout yet, but don't say a word; if you do, it will
					come. a fortnight ago I had two sheets from Mr Pitt,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1647tm" /> dated Genoa, Dec: 23; he had been 30 days in
					going from Barcelona thither, a passage often made in four; he spends the winter with Sr Rich: Lyttelton,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1648tm" /> &amp; hopes to pass the end of the Carnaval at Milan with Ld Strathmore, who has been ill at Turin, but is
					now quite recover'd. he does not speak with transport of Andalusia, (I mean of the Country, for he describes only that in generall,
					&amp; refers for particulars to our meeting) it wants verdure, &amp; wood, &amp; hands to cultivate it: but Valencia &amp; Murcia (he
					says) are one continued garden, a shady scene of cultivated lands interspersed with cottages of reed, &amp; water'd by a thousand
					artificial rills. a like spirit of industry appears in Catalonia. he has written to Pa:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1649tm" /> also, I
					suppose, to the same purpose.</p>
				<p>The only remarkable thing I have to tell you is old Wortley's Will,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1650tm" /> &amp; that perhaps you know
					already. he died worth 600,000£. this is the least I have heard, &amp; perhaps the truest; but Ld J: &amp; Mr Montagu<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1651tm" /> tell me to day, it is above a Million, &amp; that he had near 800,000£ in Mortgages only. he gives to his
					Son (who is 50,000£ in debt) 1000£ a year for life only. to his Wife, Lady Mary, (if she does not claim her dower) 1200£ a-year:
					otherwise this too to his Son for life, &amp; after him to Lady Bute, his Daughter. to all Lady Bute's Children, wch are eleven, 2000£
					a-piece. to Lady Bute for her life <hi rend="italic">all the remainder</hi> (no notice of my Lord) &amp; after her to her second Son,
					who takes the name of Wortley, &amp; so to all the Sons, &amp; (I believe) Daughters too in their order, &amp; if they all die without
					issue, to Ld Sandwich, to whom at present he gives some old Manuscripts about the Montagu family.</p>
				<p>And now I must tell you a little story about Lady Mary,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1652tm" /> wch I heard lately. upon her travels (to
					save charges) she got a passage in the Mediterranean on board a Man of War, I think it was Commodore Barnet. when he had landed her
					safe she told him, she knew she was not to offer him money, but intreated him to accept of a ring in memory of her, wch (as she press'd
					him) he accepted: it was a very large emerald. some time after a Friend of his taking notice of its beauty, he told him, how he came by
					it: the Man smiled, &amp; desired him to shew it to a Jeweller. he did so; it was unset before him, &amp; proved a Paste worth 40
					Shillings.</p>
				<p>And now I am telling stories, I will tell you another nothing at all to the purpose, nor relating to any body I have been talking of. </p>
				<p>In the year 1688 my Ld Peterborough<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1653tm" /> had a great mind to be well with Lady Sandwich<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1654tm" /> (Mrs Bonfoy's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1655tm" /> old Friend). there was a Woman, who kept a great
					Coffee-house in Pallmall, &amp; she had a miraculous Canary-Bird, that piped twenty tunes. Lady S: was fond of such things, had heard
					of, &amp; seen the bird. Ld P: came to the Woman, &amp; offer'd her a large sum of money for it; but she was rich, &amp; proud of it,
					&amp; would not part with it for love or money. however he watch'd the bird narrowly, observed all its marks &amp; features, went &amp;
					bought just such another, saun[ter']d<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1656tm" /> into the Coffee-room, took his opportunity [when] no one was
					by, slip'd the wrong bird into [the c]age, &amp; the right into his pocket, &amp; went o[ff.] [und]iscover'd to make my Ly Sandwich
					happy. this was just about the time of the Revolution; &amp; a good while after, going into the same Coffee-house again he saw his bird
					there, &amp; said, well, I reckon, you would give your ears now, that you had taken my money. money! (says the Woman) no, nor ten times
					that money now; dear little Creature! for, if your Lp will believe me (as I am a Christian it is true) it has moped &amp; moped, &amp;
					never once open'd its pretty lips, since the day that the <hi rend="italic">poor King</hi> went away!</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I have been very naughty, I confess; but I informed your Brother<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1660tm" /> a good while ago, that both your
					letters came safe to my hands. the first indeed wch went to Cambridge, had had its seal broken, wch naturally I should have attributed
					to the curiosity of somebody at Durham: but as Mr. Brown (who, you know, is care itself) sent it me without taking notice of any such
					thing, I rather believe it was mere accident, &amp; happen'd, after it had pass'd thro' his hands. </p>
				<p>I long to see you, but my visit must be defer'd to another year, for Mr. Jauncey<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1661tm" /> having lost his
						Bishop,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1662tm" /> &amp; having settled his Son in a Curacy, means to let his house entire, &amp; in September
					I shall be forced to look out for another place, &amp; must have the plague of removing. the glass-manufacture in Worcester:re<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1663tm" /> (I am told) has fail'd. Mr. Price<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1664tm" /> here has left off business, &amp;
					retired into Wales: the Person, who succeeds him, does not pretend to be acquainted with all the secrets of his art. the Man at
						York<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1665tm" /> is now in Town, exhibiting some specimens of his skill to the Society of Arts: him (you say)
					you have already consulted. coats of arms will doubtless be expensive (Price used to have five Guineas for a very plain one) figures
					much more so. unless therefore you can pick up some remnants of old painted glass, wch are sometimes met with in farm-houses, little
					out-of-the-way churches &amp; vestries, and even at country-glasiers shops, &amp;c: I should advice to buy plain colour'd glass (for
					wch they ask here in St Martin's Lane 5S: a pound, but it is sold at York for 2 or 3S:) &amp; make up the tops of your windows in a
					mosaïck of your own fancy. the glass will come to you in square plates, (some part of wch is always wrinkled &amp; full of little
					bubbles, so you must allow for waste), any glasier can cut it into <hi rend="italic">quarrels,</hi> &amp; you can dispose the pattern
					&amp; colours, red, blew, purple, &amp; yellow (there is also green, if you like it) as well or better than the Artisan himself, &amp;
					certainly much cheaper. I would not border it with the same, least the room should be too dark. nor should the <hi rend="italic"
						>quarrels</hi> of clear glass be too small (in the lower part of the window); if they are but turn'd corner-ways, it is enough to give
					it a gothic aspect. if there is anything to see (tho' it be but a tree) I should put a very large diamond-pane in the midst of each
					division.</p>
				<p>I had rather Major G:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1666tm" /> throw'd away his money, than somebody else. it is not worth while even to
					succeed, unless <hi rend="italic">gratis;</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1667tm" /> nor in any case to be attempted without the B:s<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1668tm" /> absolute

				<p>I thank you for your kind enquiries &amp; impatience about me. had I not been so often disappointed before, when I thought myself
					sure, I should have informed you before this time of my motions. I thought I was just setting out for Cambridge, when the Man (on whom
					I have a mortgage)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1676tm" /> gave me notice, that he was ready to pay in his money: so that now I must
					necessarily stay to receive it, &amp; it will be (to be sure) the middle of June<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1677tm" /> before I can see
					Cambridge, where I have long wish'd to be. Montagu had thoughts of going thither with me, but I know not what his present intentions
					may be: he is in real affliction for the loss of Sr W: Williams,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1678tm" /> who has left him one of his
					Executors, &amp; (as I doubt his affairs were a good deal embarrass'd),<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1679tm" /> he possibly may be detain'd
					in Town on that account. Mason too talk'd of staying part of the summer with me at Pembroke, but this may perhaps be only talk. My
						Lord<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1680tm" /> goes into Yorkshire this summer, so I suppose the Parson must go with him. you will not see any
						advertisement<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1681tm" /> till next winter at soonest. Southwell<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1682tm" /> is going to
					Ireland for two months, much against his will. I have not seen my new Lady E:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1683tm" /> but her Husband I
					have; so (I'm afraid) I soon must have that honor. God send Fobus<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1684tm" /> may lie in just about the
					Commencement, or I go out of my wits. that's all .. the news of the surrender of Bellisle<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1685tm" /> is daily
					expected. they have not, nor (they say) possibly can throw in either Men or provisions, so it is look'd upon as ours. I know it will be

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>When I received your letter I was still detain'd in Town: but am now at last got to Cambridge. I applied immediately to Dr
						Ashton<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1696tm" /> (who was nearest at hand) for information as to the expences of Eton without naming any one's
					name. he returned me the <hi rend="italic">civilest</hi> of answers, &amp; that if the boy was to be on the foundation, I had no more
					to do but send him to him, &amp; the business should be done. as to the charges, he was going to Eton, &amp; would send me an account
					from thence; wch he did accordingly on Sunday last,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1697tm" /> &amp; here it is inclosed with his second letter.
					you will easily conceive, that there must be additional expences, that can be reduced to no rules, as pocket-money, cloths, books,
					&amp;c: &amp; wch are left to a Father's own discretion.</p>
				<p>My notion is, that your Nephew<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1698tm" /> being an only Son, &amp; rather of a delicate constitution, ought
					not to be exposed to the hardships of the College. I know, that the expence in that way is much lessen'd; but your Brother has but one
					Son, &amp; can afford to breed him an Oppidant.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1699tm" /> I know, that a Colleger is sooner form'd to scuffle
					in the world, that is, by drubbing &amp; tyranny is made more hardy or more cunning, but these in my eyes are no such desirable
					acquisitions: I know too, that a certain (or very probable) provision for life<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1700tm" /> is a thing to be
					wish'd: but you must remember, what a thing a fellow of King's is. in short you will judge for yourselves. if you accept my <hi
						rend="italic">good Friend's</hi> offer, I will proceed accordingly: if not, we will thank him, &amp; willingly let him recommend to us
					a cheap boarding-house, not disdaining his protection &amp; encouragement, if it can be of any little use to your Nephew. he has
					married one of Amyand's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1701tm" /> Sisters with 12,000£: (I suppose, you know her; she is an enchanting
					object!), &amp; he is settled in the Preachership of Lincolns Inn.</p>
				<p>Sure Mr Jon:.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1702tm" /> or some one has told you, how your <hi rend="italic">good Friend,</hi> Mr. L:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1703tm" /> has been horsewhip'd, trampled, bruised, &amp; piss'd upon, by a Mrs Mackenzie, a sturdy Scotch Woman. it
					was done in an Inn-yard at Hampstead in the face of day, &amp; he has put her in the Crown-Office.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1704tm" /> it

				<p>As you &amp; Mr R: Wharton seem determined for the foundation, I shall say no more on that subject: it is pity you could not resolve
					sooner, for I fear you are now too late, &amp; must defer your design till the next year, as the Election at Eton begins this day
					se'nnight, &amp; your Nephew ought to be there on the evening of the 27th at farthest, wch is scarce possible. you have never told me
					his age: but (I suppose) you know, that after 15 compleat Boys are excluded from the election, &amp; that a Certificate of their age,
					(that is, an extract from the Parish-Register, where they were baptised,) is always required, wch must be attested &amp; sign'd by the
					Minister &amp; Churchwardens of the said Parish. your Nephew (I imagine) is much younger than fifteen,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1707tm"
					 /> &amp; therefore there will be no great inconvenience if he should be placed at Eton, whenever it suits Mr Wharton to carry him,
					&amp; there wait for the next election. this is commonly practised, &amp; Dr A:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1708tm" /> (I do not doubt) will
					be equally ready to serve him then, as now. he will probably be placed pretty high in the School, having had the same education, that
					is in use there,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1709tm" /> &amp; will have time to familiarise himself to the place, before he actually enters
					the College. I have waited to know your intentions, before I could answer Dr A:s letter; &amp; wish you would now write to me, what you
					finally determine. there is a Month's Breaking-up immediately after the Election (wch lasts a week) so it is probable Mr Wharton will
					hardly send his Son till those holidays are over.</p>
				<p>I do not mention the subject you hint at for the same reason you give me; it should be <hi rend="italic">offer'd,</hi> &amp; <hi
						rend="italic">clear of all taxes,</hi> before I would go into it, in spite of the mines in America,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1710tm" />

				<p>I shall hope to see Old-Park next summer, if I am not bedrid, but who can tell? Mr Brown presents his best services to the family

				<p>Every language has its idiom, not only of words and phrases, but of customs and manners, which cannot be represented in the tongue of
					another nation, especially of a nation so distant in time and place, without constraint and difficulty; of this sort, in the present
					instance, are the curfew bell, the Gothic Church, with its monuments, organs and anthems, the texts of Scripture, &amp;c. There are
					certain images, which, though drawn from common nature, and every where obvious, yet strike us as foreign to the turn and genius of
					Latin verse; the beetle that flies in the evening, to a Roman, I guess, would have appeared too mean an object for poetry; 'that leaves
					the world to darkness and to me', is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the
					right to drop it.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1738tm" /></p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I am just come to Town, where I shall stay six weeks or more, &amp; (if you will send your dimensions) will look out for
						papers<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1741tm" /> at the shops. I own I never yet saw any Gothic papers<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1742tm" /> to my
					fancy. there is one fault, that is in the nature of the thing, &amp; can not be avoided. the great beauty of all Gothick designs is the
					variety of perspectives they occasion. this a Painter may represent on the walls of a room in some measure; but not a Designer of
					Papers, where, what is represented on one breadth, must be exactly repeated on another, both in the light &amp; shade, and in the
					dimensions. this we can not help; but they do not even do what they might: they neglect Hollar,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1743tm" /> to
					copy Mr. Halfpenny's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1744tm" /> architecture, so that all they do is more like a goosepie than a cathedral. you
					seem to suppose, that they do Gothic papers in colours, but I never saw any but such as were to look like Stucco:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1745tm" /> nor indeed do I conceive that they could have any effect or meaning. lastly, I never saw any thing of
					gilding, such as you mention, on paper, but we shall see. only pray leave as little to my judgement as possible.</p>
				<p>I thank'd Dr Ashton before you told me to do so. he writes me word, that (except the first Sunday of a month) he believes, he shall
					be at Eton till the middle of November; &amp; (as he now knows the person in question is your nephew)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1746tm" />
					adds, I remember Dr Wharton with great pleasure, &amp; beg you will signify as much to him, when you write.</p>
				<p>The King is just married,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1747tm" /> it is the hottest night in the year.</p>

					<dateline>Sept: 24. 1761. London. </dateline>
					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I set out at half an hour past four in the morning for the Coronation,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1767tm" /> &amp; (in the midst of
					perils &amp; dangers) arrived very safe at my Ld Chamberlain's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1768tm" /> Box in Westminster Hall. it was on the
					left hand of the throne over that appropriated to the Foreign Ministers. opposite to us was the Box of the Earl Marshal,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1769tm" /> &amp; other Great Officers, &amp; below it that of the Princess,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1770tm" /> &amp;
					younger Part of the Royal Family.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1771tm" /> next them was the royal sideboard. then below the steps of the
					Haut-pas were the tables of the Nobility on each side quite to the door, behind them boxes for the sideboards, over these the galleries
					for the Peers Tickets, &amp; still higher the boxes of the Auditor,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1772tm" /> the board of Green-Cloth,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1773tm" /> &amp;c: all these throng'd with people head above head, all dress'd, &amp; the Women with their Jewels on.
					in the front of the throne was a Triomfe of foliage &amp; flowers, resembling nature, placed on the royal table, &amp; rising as high
					as the canopy itself. the several bodies, that were to form the procession, issued from behind the throne gradually &amp; in order, and
					proceeding down the steps were ranged on either side of the hall, all the Privy-Councellors, that are Commoners, (I think) were there,
					(except Mr Pitt), mightily dress'd in rich stuffs of gold &amp; colours with long flowing wigs, some of them comical figures enough.
					the Kn:s of the Bath with their high plumage were very ornamental, of the Scotch Peers or Peeresses, that you see in the list, very few
					walk'd; &amp; of the English Dowagers as few, tho' many of them were in Town &amp; among the Spectators.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1774tm"
					 /> the noblest and most graceful figures among the Ladies, were the Marchioness of Kildare (as Viscountess Leinster)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1775tm" /> Visc:ss Spencer, Countesses of Harrington, Pembroke &amp; Strafford, &amp; the Duchess of Richmond. of the
					older sort (for there is a grace, that belongs to age too) the Countess of Westmoreland C:ss of Albermarle, &amp; Dutchess of
					Queensberry. I should mention too the odd and extraordinary appearances: they were the Visc:ss Say &amp; Sele, Countesses of
					Portsmouth, &amp; another that I do not name, because she is said to be an extraordinary good woman,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1776tm" />
					Countess of Harcourt, &amp; Dutchess of St Albans. of the Men doubtless the noblest and most striking figure was the Earl of
						Errol,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1777tm" /> &amp; after him the Dukes of Ancaster, Richmond, Marlborough, Kingston; Earl of Northampton,
					Pomfret, Visc:t Weymouth, &amp;c: the comical<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1778tm" /> Men were the Earl Talbot<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1779tm"
					 /> (most in sight of anybody) Earls of Delawere &amp; Macclesfield, Lords Montfort &amp; Melcombe. all these I beheld at great
					leisure. then the Princess and Royal Family enter'd their Box; the Queen, &amp; then the King, took their places in their chairs of
					state, glitt'ring with jewels (for the hire of wch, beside all his own, he paid 9000£) &amp; the Dean &amp; Chapter (who had been
					waiting without doors a full hour &amp; half) brought up the Regalia, wch the D. of Ancaster<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1780tm" /> received
					and placed on the Table. here ensued great confusion in the delivering them out to the Lords, who were appointed to bear them. the
					Heralds were stupid; the Great Officers knew nothing they were doing; the Bp of Rochester<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1781tm" /> would have
					drop'd the Crown, if it had not been pin'd to the Cushion, &amp; the King was often obliged to call out, &amp; set matters
						right:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1782tm" /> but the Sword of State had been entirely forgot; so Ld Huntingdon<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1783tm" /> was forced to carry the Ld Mayor's great two-handed sword instead of it. this made it later than ordinary,
					before they got under their canopies, &amp; set forward. I should have told you, that the old Bp of Lincoln<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1784tm" /> with his stick went doddling by the side of the Queen, &amp; the Bp of Chester<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1785tm" /> had the pleasure of bearing the gold paten. when they were gone we went down to dinner, for there were
					three rooms below, where the Duke of Devonshire<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1786tm" /> was so good to feed us with great cold Sirloins of
					beef, legs of mutton, fillets of veal, &amp; other substantial viands, and liqueurs, w:ch we devour'd all higgledy-piggledy like
					Porters. after w:ch every one scrambled up again &amp; seated themselves. the tables were now spread, the cold viands set on &amp; at
					the Kings table &amp; side-board a great show of gold-plate, &amp; a desert representing Parnassus with abundance of figures of Muses,
					Arts, &amp;c. design'd by Ld Talbot:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1787tm" /> this was so high, that those at the end of the Hall could see
					neither K: nor Queen at supper. when they return'd, it was so dark, that the People without doors scarce saw anything of the
					procession, &amp; as the Hall had then no other light than two long ranges of candles at each of the Peers tables, we saw almost as
					little as they; only one perceived the Lds &amp; Ladies sidleing in &amp; taking their places to dine, but the instant the Queen's
					Canopy enter'd, fire was given to all the Lustres at once by trains of prepared flax, that reached from one to the other. to me it
					seem'd an interval of not half a minute, before the whole was in a blaze of splendor. it is true, that for that half minute it rain'd
					fire upon the heads of all the spectators (the flax falling in large flakes) &amp; the Ladies (Queen &amp; all) were in no small
					terrors, but no mischief ensued. it was out as soon as it fell, &amp; the most magnificent spectacle, I ever beheld remain'd. the K:
					(bowing to the Lords as he pass'd) with his crown on his head, &amp; the sceptre &amp; orb in his hands, took his place with great
					majesty &amp; grace: so did the Q: with her crown, sceptre &amp; rod. then supper was served in gold plate, the Earl Talbot, D: of
						Bedford,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1788tm" /> &amp; E: of Effingham,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1789tm" /> in their robes, all three on
					horseback prancing &amp; curvetting, like the hobby-horses in the Rehearsal,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1790tm" /> usher'd in the courses
					to the foot of the haut-pas. between the courses the Champion<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1791tm" /> performed his part with applause. the
					E. of Denbigh<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1792tm" /> carved for the King, E. of Holdernesse<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1793tm" /> for the Queen:
					they both eat like farmers. at the board's end on the right sup'd the Ds: of York<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1794tm" /> &amp;
						Cumberland,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1795tm" /> on the left Lady Augusta,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1796tm" /> all of them very rich in
					jewels. the maple cups, the wafers, the faulcons, &amp;c: were brought up &amp; presented in form, 3 persons were knighted,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1797tm" /> &amp; before 10 the K: &amp; Q: retired. then I got a scrap of supper, &amp; at one o'clock I walk'd home.
					so much for the spectacle, wch. in magnificence surpass'd every thing I have seen. next I must tell you, that the Barons of the
						Cinque-ports,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1798tm" /> who by ancient right should dine at a table on the Haut-pas at the right hand of the
					throne, found that no provision at all had been made for them, &amp; representing their case to Earl Talbot, he told them Gentlemen, if
					you speak to me as High-Steward I must tell you, there was no room for you: if as Ld Talbot, I am ready to give you satisfaction in any
					way you think fit. they are several of them Gentlemen of the best families, so this has bred ill blood. in the next place the City of
					London found they had no table neither; but Beckford<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1799tm" /> bullied my Ld High Steward, till he was forced
					to give them that intended for the Kn:ts of the Bath &amp; instead of it they dined at the entertainment prepared for the Great
					Officers. 3dly<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1800tm" /> &amp; lastly (this is fact) when the Queen retired while she was in the Abbey, to a
					sort of closet furnish'd with necessary conveniences, one of the Ladies opening the door to see all was right, found the D:e of
					Newcastle perk'd up &amp; in the very act upon the anointed velvet closestool. Do not think I joke, it is literally true.</p>
				<p>Bussy<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1801tm" /> was not at the ceremony: he is just setting out for France. Spain has supplied them with
					money, &amp; is picking a quarrel with us about the fishery &amp; the logwood.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1802tm" /> Mr Pitt says, so much
					the better! &amp; was for recalling Ld Bristol<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1803tm" /> directly: however a flat denial has been return'd to
					their pretentions.</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Do not think me very dilatory, for I have been sending away all my things from this house (where nevertheless I shall continue while
					I stay in Town) &amp; have besides been confined with a severe cold to my room. on rummageing Mr Bromwich's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1825tm" /> &amp; several other shops I am forced to tell you, that there are absolutely no papers at all, that deserve
					the name of Gothick, or that you would bear the sight of. they are all what they call <hi rend="italic">fancy,</hi> &amp; indeed
					resemble nothing that ever was in use in any age or country. I am going to advise, what perhaps you may be deter'd from by the addition
					of expence, but what, in your case I should certainly do. any body that can draw the least in the world is capable of sketching in
					Indian ink a compartment or two of diaper-work, or a nich or tabernacle with its fretwork: take such a Man with you to
					Durham-Cathedral, &amp; let him copy one division of any ornament you think will have any effect, from the high-altar suppose or the
					nine altars, or what you please. if nothing there suits you, chuse in Dart's Canterbury<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1826tm" /> or Dugdale's
						Warwickshire,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1827tm" /> &amp;c: &amp; send the design hither. they will execute it here, &amp; make a new
					stamp on purpose, provided you will take 20 pieces of it, &amp; it will come to 1/2 or a penny a yard the more (according to the work,
					that is in it). this I really think worth your while. I mention your doing it there, because it will be then under your own eye, &amp;
					at your own choice, &amp; you can proportion the whole better to the dimensions of your room, for if the design be of arcade work, or
					any thing on a pretty large scale, &amp; the arches or niches are to rise one above the other, there must be some contrivance, that
					they may fill the entire space &amp; not be cut in sunder and incompleat .. this indeed, where the work is in small compartments, is
					not to be minded. say therefore, if you come into this; or shall I take a Man here to Westminster, &amp; let him copy some of those
					fretworks? tho' I think, in the books I have named you may find better things. I much doubt of the effect colours (any other than the
					tints of stucco) would have in a gothic design on paper, &amp; here they have <anchor xml:id="tg2a.1827tm" /> nothing to judge from.
					those I spoke of at Ely were green &amp; pale blue with the raised work white, if you care to hazard it. I saw an all-silver paper
					quite plain, &amp; it look'd like block-tin. in short there is nothing I would venture to send you. One of 3D a yard in small
					compartments thus, might perhaps do for the stairs, but very likely it is common, &amp; besides it is not pure gothick, therefore I
					would not send it alone. Adieu &amp; tell me soon what I shall do.</p>

				<p>Your letter has rejoiced me (as you will easily believe) &amp; agreeably disappointed me. I congratulate you in the first place;
					&amp; am very glad to see, the College have had the spirit &amp; the sense to do a thing so much to their credit, &amp; to do it in a
					handsome manner. my best service to Mr Lyon, &amp; tell him it will be a great disobligation, if my Lady<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1830tm"

						xml:id="id_tg2a.1831tm" /> I hope to be with you in about a week, but will write again before I come: do persuade Mr Delaval to stay:
					tell him, I will say any thing he pleases of Mr P:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1832tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Have you read the Negotiations? (I speak not to Mr Del:, but to you) the French have certainly done Mr P: service in publishing them.
					the spirit &amp; contempt he has shewn in his treatment of Bussy's proposals, whether right or wrong, will go near to restore him to
					his popularity, &amp; almost make up for the disgrace of the pension. my Ld T:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1833tm" /> is outrageous: he
					makes no scruple of declaring, that the D: of N: &amp; Ld B:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1834tm" /> were the persons, whose frequent
					opposition in Council were the principal cause of this resignation. he has (as far as he could) disinherited his Brother G: Gr:lle that
					is, of about 4000£ a-year, his Father's estate. &amp; yesterday he made a very strange speech in the House, that surprised every body.
					the particulars I can not yet hear with certainty. but the D: of Bedford replied to it.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1835tm" /> did you
					observe a <hi rend="italic">very bold</hi> letter in the Gazetteer<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1836tm" /> of Thursday last about <hi

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I went as soon as I received your last letter, to chuse papers for you at Bromwich's.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1841tm" /> I applaud
					your determination, for it is mere pedantry in Gothicism to stick to nothing but altars &amp; tombs, &amp; there is no end of it, if we
					are to sit upon nothing but Coronation-chairs, nor drink out of nothing but chalices &amp; flagons. the idea is sufficiently kept up,
					if we live in an ancient house, but with modern conveniences about us. nobody will expect the inhabitants to wear ruffs &amp;
					farthingales. besides these things are not to be had, unless we make them ourselves.</p>
				<p>I have however ventured to bespeak (for the staircase) the stucco-paper of 3D a yard, wch I mention'd to you before. it is rather
					pretty, &amp; nearly Gothick. the border is entirely so, &amp; where it runs horizontally, will be very proper; where perpendicularly,
					not altogether so: I do not see, how this could be avoided. the crimson paper is the handsomest I ever saw; from its simplicity, I
					believe, as it is nothing but the same thing repeated throughout. Mr. Trevor (Hambden<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1842tm" /> ) design'd it
					for his own use. the border is a spiral scroll, also the prettiest I have seen. this paper is 8D: a yard. the blew is the most
					extravagant, a mohair-flock paper of a shilling a yard, wch I fear you will blame me for; but it was so handsome, &amp; look'd so warm,
					I could not resist it. the pattern is small, &amp; will look like a cutvelvet: the border a scroll like the last, but on a larger
					scale. you will ask, why the crimson (wch was to be the best) is not a mohair-paper too? because it would have no effect in that sort
					of pattern; &amp; it is as handsome as it need to be, without that expence. the library paper is a cloth-colour: all I can say for it
					is, that it was the next best design they had after the former. I think it is 7D1/2 a yard. they do not keep any quantity by them (only
					samples of each sort) but promise, they shall be finish'd in a week, &amp; sent to your Brother's, with whom I have left the bill, as I
					go myself to Cambridge in a day or two. indeed this is a very improper time to trouble him, tho' when I call'd there last night, I was
					told she<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1843tm" /> was a great <hi rend="italic">deal better.</hi> I did not know of his loss<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1844tm" /> till you told me: on wch I went to ask how they did, &amp; found him truly in a very deplorable situation.

					foolishly so called, yet there is a sort of plan and unity in it very strange for a barbarous age; yet what I more admire are some of

				<p>The best piece of news I have to send you is, that Mason is Residentiary of York,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1870tm" /> wch is worth near
					200£ a-year: he owes it to our Friend Mr F: Montagu,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1871tm" /> who is Brother-in-Law to Dean Fountayne.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1872tm" /> the Precentorship (worth as much more) being vacant at the same time, Ld H:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1873tm"
					 /> has obtain'd that too for him: but for this he must come &amp; kiss hands; &amp; as the ceremony is not yet over, we do not
					proclaim it aloud for the present. he now (I think) may wait for Mr Hutton's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1874tm" /> exit with great
					patience, &amp; shut his insatiable repining mouth. I hope to see him here in his way to Town.</p>
				<p>I pity your Brother,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1875tm" /> &amp; have little hope left of his Wife's recovery: tho' I have been told that
					Dr Lowth's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1876tm" /> after she had continued for some years in that condition, was perfectly restored. it may
					be worth while to enquire in what method she was treated. the papers<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1877tm" /> were to have been sent to
					Boswel-Court the week after I left London to be seen before they were pack'd up. Mr Jonathan is perhaps unable to attend to it, but
					doubtless you have order'd somebody to hasten Bromwich, &amp; see that the sorts are right. I shall not be at London till the middle of
						March.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1878tm" /> My old Friend Miss Speed<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1879tm" /> has done what the World calls a
					very foolish thing. she has married<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1880tm" /> the Baron de la Peyriere,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1881tm" /> Son
					to the Sardinian Minister, the Comte de Viry.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1882tm" /> he is about 28 years old, (ten years younger than
						herself)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1883tm" /> but looks nearer 40. this is not the effect of debauchery, for he is a very sober Man;
					good-natured &amp; honest, &amp; no Conjurer.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1884tm" /> the estate of the family is about 4000£ a-year. the
					Castle of Viry is in Savoy a few miles from Geneva, commanding a fine view of the Lake. what she has done with her money, I know not:
					but (I suspect) kept it to herself. her religion she need not change,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1885tm" /> but she must never expect to be
					well-received at that Court, till she does; &amp; I do not think she will make quite a <hi rend="italic">Julie</hi> in the

				</p>
				<p>The Heloïse cruelly disappointed me, but it has its Partisans, among wch are Mason<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1887tm" /> &amp; Mr Hurd.
					for me I admire nothing but Fingal<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1888tm" /> (I conclude, you have read it: if not, Stonhewer can lend it you)
					yet I remain still in doubt about the authenticity of those poems, tho' inclining rather to believe them genuine in spite of the World.
					whether they are the inventions of antiquity, or of a modern Scotchman, either case is to me alike unaccountable. je m'y pers.</p>
				<p>I take no joy in the Spanish War,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1889tm" /> being too old to privateer, &amp; too poor to buy stock;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1890tm" /> nor do I hope for a good end of any war, as it will be now probably conducted. oh that foolishest of Great
					Men, that sold his inestimable diamond<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1891tm" /> for a paltry peerage &amp; pension: the very night it happen'd
					was I swearing, that it was a damn'd lie, &amp; never could be: but it was for want of reading Thomas a Kempis,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1892tm" /> who knew Mankind so much better, than I.</p>
				<p>Young Pitt<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1893tm" /> (whom I believe you have heard me mention) is return'd to England: from him I hope to
					get much information concerning Spain, wch no body has seen: he is no bad Observer. I saw a Man yesterday, who has been atop of M:
					Ætna, &amp; seen the ruins of a Temple at Agrigentum,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1894tm" /> whose Columns (when standing) were 96 feet in
					height: a moderate Man might hide himself in one of the flutings. by the way there is a Mr Phelps<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1895tm" />
					(now gone Secretary with the Embassy to Turin) who has been all over Sicily, &amp; means to give us an account of its remains. there
					are two more volumes of Buffon<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1896tm" /> (the 9th &amp; 10th) arrived in England; &amp; the two last Maps of
						D'anville's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1897tm" /> Europe. one Mr Needham,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1898tm" /> Tutor to a Ld
						Gormanstown<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1899tm" /> now on his travels, has made a strange discovery. he saw a figure of Isis at Turin, on
					whose back was a pilaster of antique characters, not hieroglyphicks, but such as are sometimes seen on Egyptian statues. when he came
					to Rome, in the Vatican Library he was shew'd a Glossary of the ancient Chinese tongue. he was struck with the similitude of the
					characters, &amp; on comparing them with an exact copy he had of the inscription, found that he could read it, &amp; that it signified,
					| This Statue of Isis is copied from another in such a City: the original is so many measures in height, &amp; so many in
						breadth.|<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1900tm" /> if this be true, it may open many new things to us. Deguignes<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1901tm" /> some time ago wrote a dissertation to prove, that China was peopled from Egypt. </p>
				<p>I still flatter myself with the notion of seeing you in Summer: but God knows, how it will be. I am persuading Mr Brown to make a
					visit to Lady Strathmore<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1902tm" /> (who has often invited him) &amp; then you will see him too: he is at

				<p>I return you my best thanks for the copy of your book,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1916tm" /> which you sent me, and have not at all
					lessened my opinion of it since I read it in print,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1917tm" /> though the press has in general<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1918tm" /> a bad effect on the complection of one's works. The engravings look, as you say, better than I had
					expected, yet not altogether so well as I could wish. I rejoice in the good dispositions of our court, and in the propriety of their
					application to you: the work is a thing so much to be wished; has so near a connection with the turn of your studies and of your
					curiosity; and might find such ample materials among your hoards and in your head; that it will be a sin if you let it drop and come to
					nothing, or worse than nothing, for want of your assistance. The historical part should be in the manner of Henault,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1919tm" /> a mere abridgement, a series of facts selected with judgment, that may serve as a clue to lead the mind
					along in the midst of those ruins and scattered monuments of art, that time has spared.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1920tm" /> This would be
					sufficient, and better than Montfaucon's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1921tm" /> more diffuse narrative. Such a work (I have heard) Mr.
						Burke<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1922tm" /> is now employed about, which though not intended for this purpose might be applied perhaps to
					this use. Then at the end of each reign should come a dissertation explanatory of the plates, and pointing out the turn of thought, the
					customs, ceremonials, arms, dresses, luxury, and private life, with the improvement or decline of the arts during that period. This you
					must do yourself, beside taking upon you the superintendence, direction, and choice of materials. As to the expence, that must be the
					king's own entirely, and he must give the book to foreign ministers and people of note; for it is obvious no private man can undertake
					such a thing without a subscription, and no gentleman will care for such an expedient; and a gentleman it should be, because he must
					have easy access to archives, cabinets, and collections of all sorts. I protest I do not think it impossible but they may give into
					such a scheme: they approve the design, they wish to encourage the arts and to be magnificent, and they have no Versailles or
						Herculaneum.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1923tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I hope to see you toward the end of March. If you bestow a line on me, pray tell me whether the baronne de la Peyriere<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1924tm" /> is gone to her castle of Viry; and whether Fingal<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1925tm" /> be discovered or
					shrewdly suspected to be a forgery.</p>

				<p>I send your Reverence the lesson,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1927tm" /> wch is pure good-nature on my part, knowing already as I do, that
					you don't like it. no sooner do people feel their income increase than they want amusement! why what need have you of any other, than

					your own <hi rend="italic">corpses</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1928tm" /> and revenues? the Pentagrapher<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1929tm" /> is gone to Town, so you have
					nothing to do but to go &amp; multiply in your own vulgar way: only don't fall to work, &amp; forget to say grace.</p>
				<p>The Laureat<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1930tm" /> has honour'd me, (as a Friend of yours, for I know no other reason) with his new
						Play<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1931tm" /> &amp; his Charge to the Poets,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1932tm" /> the first very middleing; the
					second I am pleased with, chiefly with the sense, &amp; sometimes with the verse &amp; expression: and yet the best thing he ever wrote
					was that Elegy against Friendship<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1933tm" /> you once shew'd me, where the sense was detestable; so that you see
					it is not at all necessary a Poet should be a good sort of Man, no, not even in his writings. Bob Lloyd<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1934tm"

					Translation of my Elegy;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1936tm" /> an Epistle in wch is a very serious compliment to me by name, particularly

						abused;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1938tm" /> &amp; a note to say, they were written in concert with his Friend Mr Coleman: so little
					value have poets for themselves, especially when they would make up a just volume. Mr Delap<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1939tm" /> is here

					behind the scenes. I much like Dr Lowth's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1944tm" /> Grammar: it is concise, clear, &amp; elegant. he has
					selected his Solecisms from all the best Writers of our Tongue. I hear Mr Hurd<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1945tm" /> is seriously writing

				<p>You are not to take this for a letter: it is a message, that I am forced to send. there is a Mr. Tho: Hornsby,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1950tm" /> an Apothecary at Durham, who makes a sort of Lozenges said to be good in a gouty cough, &amp; indigestions.

						Abdy-family<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1952tm" /> (whose stock is nearly exhausted) fancies they do her great service. I therefore must
					beg you would send to Mr Hornsby, &amp; let him put up a quarter of a pound in as little compass as he can, &amp; send it to the
					Post-Master (directed to Mrs Antrobus,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1953tm" /> Post-Mistress at Cambridge) &amp; let him put it in the mail.
					the sooner this can be done the better, &amp; you will oblige me &amp; the Patient.</p>
				<p>I am sorry, you are forced to complain of this untoward suffocating season: but who has escaped without illness? for me I have felt
					neither cold nor fever: but I have had two slight attacks of the Gout after near three years intermission: it is well, if I escape

				<p>After my fortnight's residence at York, I am arrived here. The Precentor is very hopefully improved in dignity; his scarf sets the
					fullest about his ears: his surplice has the most the air of lawn-sleeves you can imagine in so short a time; he begins to complain of
					qualms and indigestions from repose and repletion: in short <hi rend="italic">il tranche du Prelat.</hi> We went twice a-day to church
					with our vergers and all our pomp. Here the scene is totally altered: we breakfast at six in the morning and go to bed at ten. The
					house rings all day with carpenters and upholsterers, and without doors we swarm with labourers and builders.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1962tm" /> The books are not yet unpacked, and there is but one pen and ink in the house. Jetty and Fadge (two
					favourite sows) are always coming into the entry, and there is a concert of poultry under every window: we take in no newspaper or
					magazine, but the cream and butter is beyond compare. You are wished for every day, and you may imagine how acceptable a correspondent
					you must be.</p>

				<p>I feel very ungrateful every day, that I continue silent, &amp; yet I do not write to you: but now the pen is in my hand, and I am in
					for it. when I left you,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1969tm" /> in spite of the rain I went out of my way to Richmond, &amp; made a shift to
					see the Castle, &amp; look down upon the valley, thro' wch the Swale winds: that was all the weather would permitt. at Rippon I visited
					the Church, which we had neglected before,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1970tm" /> with some pleasure, &amp; saw the Ure full to its brink
					&amp; very inclinable to overflow. some faint gleams of sunshine gave me an opportunity of walking over Studley, &amp; descending into
					the ruins of Fountain's Abbey,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1971tm" /> wch I examined with attention. I pass'd over the ugly moor of
					Harrowgate, made a bow to the Queen's-Head,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1972tm" /> &amp; got late at night to Leedes: here the rain was so
					perverse I could scarce see the Town, much less go to Kirkstall-Abbey,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1973tm" /> wch was my intention; so I
					proceeded to Wakefield,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1974tm" /> &amp; Wentworth Castle.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1975tm" /> here the Sun again
					indulged me, &amp; open'd as beautiful a scene of rich &amp; cultivated country, as (I am told) Yorkshire affords. the water is all
					artificial, but with an air of nature; much wood; a very good house in the Q: Anne style, wch is now new-fronting in a far better taste
					by the present Earl;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1976tm" /> many pictures not worth a farthing,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1977tm" /> &amp; a
					castle built only for a play-thing on the top of the hill as a point of view, &amp; to command a noble prospect. I went on to
						Sheffield,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1978tm" /> liked the situation in a valley by a pretty river's side, surrounded with charming hills:
					saw the handsome parish-church<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1979tm" /> with the chappel &amp; monuments of the Talbots.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.1980tm" /> then I enter'd the Peak,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1981tm" /> a countrey beyond comparison uglier than any
					other I have seen in England, black, tedious, barren, &amp; not mountainous enough to please one with its horrors. this is mitigated,
					since you were there, by a road like a bowling-green, wch soon brought me to Chatsworth.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1982tm" /> the house

						Scots,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1992tm" /> was but just walk'd down into the Park with her Guard for half-an-hour. her Gallery, her room
					of audience, her antichamber, with the very canopies, chair of state, footstool, Lit-de-repos, Oratory, carpets, &amp; hangings, just
					as she left them. a little tatter'd indeed, but the more venerable; &amp; all preserved with religious care, &amp; paper'd up in
					winter. the park &amp; country are just like Hertfordshire. I went by Chesterfield &amp; Mansfield to revisit my old friend the Trent
					at Nottingham, where I passed 2 or 3 days,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1993tm" /> &amp; from thence took stage-coach to London.</p>
				<p>When I arrived there, I found Professor Turner<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1994tm" /> had been dead above a fortnight, &amp; being
					cocker'd and spirited up by some Friends (tho' it was rather of the latest) I got my name suggested to Ld B:.<anchor

					 /> I received my answer very soon, wch was what you may easily imagine, but join'd with great professions of <hi rend="italic">his
						desire to serve me</hi> on any future occasion, &amp; many more fine words, that I pass over, not out of modesty, but for another
					reason. so you see I have made my fortune, like Sr Fr: Wronghead.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1997tm" /> this <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>
					is a profound secret, and no one here suspects it even now: today I hear, that Delaval has got it, but we are not yet certain: next to
					myself I wish'd for him.</p>
				<p>You see we have made a peace.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.1998tm" /> I shall be silent about it, because if I say anything
					antiministerial, you will tell me, you know the reason; &amp; if I approve it, you will tell me, I have expectations still. all I know
					is, that the D: of Newcastle &amp; Ld Hardwick both say, it is an excellent Peace; &amp; only Mr Pitt calls it inglorious &amp;
					insidious.</p>
				<p>I had a little Gout twice, while I was in Town, wch confined me some time: yet I bespoke your chairs. they are what is call'd <hi
						rend="italic">Rout-Chairs,</hi> but as they are to be a little better in shape &amp; materials than ordinary, will come to about 6s 9d

					<salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>As to my pardon, for which you supplicate, you know too well how easily it is obtain'd without any reason at all: but now I have a
					very good one, as I have read the third Book of <hi rend="italic">the Ghost,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2001tm" /> where Churchill has so mumbled Mr Whitehead,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2002tm" /> to whom you owe all
					your principles (see the unpublish'd elegy <hi rend="italic">de Amicitiâ</hi>)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2003tm" /> that it would be base
					in me to demand any farther satisfaction. this only I shall add, that I would rather steal the Laureate's verses, than his
					sentiments.</p>
				<p>I am sorry for the disagreeable event<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2004tm" /> you mention, wch I learnt by mere accident from Mr
						Curtall<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2005tm" /> in a Coffee-House: I do not doubt, it must have taken up a good deal of your thoughts &amp;
					time, &amp; should wish to know, whether there are any hopes of the poor Fellow's recovery.</p>
				<p>We have received your poetical packet,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2006tm" /> &amp; deliver'd them to the several parties. the sentiments
					we do not remark, as we can find nothing within ourselves congenial to them. for the expression, we hint (but in a low &amp; timid
					voice) that there is a want of <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi>: in short they are nothing like the
					Choruses in Elfrida. only the lines that relate to Lady Cov:s<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2007tm" /> beauty have made a deep impression upon
					us: we get them by heart, &amp; apply them to our Sempstresses &amp; Bedmakers. this is (I think) the sum &amp; substance of our
					reflections here. only Mrs Rutherforth<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2008tm" /> observes, that there is great delicacy &amp; tenderness in the
					manner of treating so frail a character as that of L:y Cov:, &amp; that you have found a way to reconcile contempt &amp; compassion.
					these might not be her words, but this was the sense of them; &amp; I don't believe, she had it from the Doctor.</p>
				<p>I rejoice (in a weakly way, you may be sure, as I have not seen him some years, &amp; am in so different a way of life) but I rejoice
					to hear of any accession to Mr Hurd's fortune,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2009tm" /> as I do not believe he will be any thing the worse for
					it. Forester<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2010tm" /> (whom I perceive you can still remember) is removed from Easton<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2011tm" /> to a better living by his Patron Ld Maynard<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2012tm" /> on purpose to get rid of him,
					for Easton is his own parish, &amp; he was sick to death of his company. he is now seated just by his Brother Pulter,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2013tm" /> &amp; they are mortal foes.</p>
				<p>Mr Brockett has got old Turner's Professorship,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2014tm" /> &amp; Delaval has lost it. when we meet I have
					something to tell you on this subject. I hope to continue here till March: if not, I shall inform you. how does the Peace<anchor

					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I send you with this a drawing of the Ruin<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2017tm" /> you were so much pleasd with when you saw it at York. I
					take it certainly to have been the Chapell of St Sepulchre founded by Archbishop Roger<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2018tm" /> of wch
						Dugdale<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2019tm" /> has given us the original Charta Fundationis. But as this opinion seems to contradict the
					opinion of Torre,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2020tm" /> &amp; of Drake<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2021tm" /> too, who follows him, It is
					necessary to produce authentic Authority in proof of my Assertion. These two learned Antiquarys suppose that the Chapell in quæstion
						<hi rend="italic">ioind</hi> to the Minster. Thus Torre: 'Roger <anchor xml:id="tg2a.2021tm" /> ABp having built <hi rend="italic"
						>against</hi> the great Church a Chapell.' &amp; Drake: 'Roger was buried in the Cathedral <hi rend="italic">near the door of</hi> St.
					Sepulchres chapel wch he himself had founded.' Vide Drake's Ebor: P. 478. P. 421. From these accts we should be led to conclude that
					this Chapell was as much and as close an appendage to the Minster as the Chapterhouse is. But the original records on wch they found
					this opinion May I think be construed very differently.</p>
				<p> ABp Roger himself in his Charta Fundationis describes its situation thus. 'Capellam quam&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">juxta</hi> majorem
					Ecclesiam extruximus.' Juxta is surely <hi rend="italic">near</hi> only, not <hi rend="italic">adjoining</hi> and this ruin is <hi
						rend="italic">near</hi> enough. In the Extract of this ABps life from an antient MS wch Dugdale also gives us we find these words
					'Condidit etiam Capellam Sancti Sepulchri <hi rend="italic">ad Januam ipsius Palatii</hi> ex parte boreali ejusd. Eccles S. Petri.' The
					Ruin in quæstion might very probably be connected with the Pallace gate by a Cloyster of wch on one side there are a string of Arches
					remaining, and on the outside of the Minster over the little gate next the Tomb there are also vestiges of the roof of a Cloyster wch I
					imagine went asside the Pallace gateway &amp; connected the three buildings. Vide plan. But between this little gate &amp; the Pallace
					gate (which still remains) it is very evident there was no room for any thing but a Cloyster, for I dont think they are twenty yards
					asunder.</p>
				<p>The last and only further acct I can find of the situation is from the same Life. Where it is said The Canons of St Peter graviter
					murmurabant super situ dictæ capellæ eo quod <hi rend="italic">nimis adhæsit</hi> Matrici Ecclesiæ. This I think need not be translated
					litterally. the word nimis leads one to a metaphorical sense. The Preists of St Sepulchre were too near neighbours to St Peters Canons
					&amp; were troublesome to them, accordingly we find the ABp to quiet matters orderd that the Sacrist of his Chappel should make them a
					recompence, which is in this extract Stated.</p>
				<p>To These Arguments I would add that ABp Rogers donation was very great, (as we find in Drake) to this Chapell. and from the Number of
					Persons maintaind in its Service I quæstion not but there was a large Convent built round it, of wch there are plainly the foundations
					still to be seen. and what puts the matter out of all doubt that this building was seperate &amp; entire (tho indeed near to the
					Minster) is the following fact viz that the Tythes of the Chapell &amp; Chapell itself were sold to one Webster Ann: 4 Q Eliz. 'Capella
					vocat: St Sepulcres Chapell <hi rend="italic">prope</hi> Eccles: Cath Eborum cum decimis ejusdem. W. Webster. Ap: 4, Anno 4 Eliz.
					Rolls: Chap: Thus you see the <hi rend="italic">juxta</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">prope</hi> are clearly on my side the <hi
						rend="italic">nimis adhæsit</hi> is equivocal. I conclude with a rude Draught of the Platform according to my Idea, but without any
					mensuration &amp; merely to explain what has been said. I am with the greatest respect &amp; defference to your Sagacity.</p>
				<closer>
					<salute>yours &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c </salute>
				</closer>
				<postscript>
					<p>P.S. I ought to mention to you, that in the transept (I think you call it) of the Church namely at B there is at the top over the
						large Pillars, a range of Stonework like the windows in the ruin, viz three pointed arches under a circular one, but of a clumsey
						proportion. This part I think you said was the oldest in the Minster. Johny Ludlam<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2022tm" /> found this out.
						perhaps it contradicts all Ive been saying &amp; proves the Building much older than Bp Roger.</p>

				<p>I am obliged to you for your Drawing, &amp; very <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> dissertation annex'd.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2033tm"
					 /> you have made out your point with a great degree of probability (for tho' the <hi rend="italic">nimis adhæsit</hi> might startle
					one, yet the sale of the tythes and chappel to Webster seems to set all right again) &amp; I do believe the building in question was
					the Chappel of St Sepulchre. but then, that the ruin now standing was the individual chappel as erected by Archb:p Roger I can by no
					means think: I found myself merely on the style &amp; taste of architecture. the vaults under the Choir are still in being, &amp; were
					undoubtedly built by this very Archbishop: they are truly Saxon, only that the arches are pointed, tho' very obtusely. it is the
					South-Transept (not the North) that is the oldest part of the Minster now above ground: it is said to have been begun by Geffrey
						Plantagenet,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2034tm" /> who died about 30 years after Roger, &amp; left it unfinish'd. his Successor Walter
						Grey<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2035tm" /> compleated it, so we do not exactly know, to wch of these two Prelates we are to ascribe any
					certain part of it. Grey lived a long time, &amp; was Archb:p from 1216 to 1255 (39no Henr: 3); &amp; in this reign it was, that the
					beauty of the Gothic Architecture began to appear. the Chapter-House is in all probability his work, &amp; (I should suppose) built in
					his latter days, whereas what he did of the South-Transept might be perform'd soon after his accession. it is in the second Order of
					this building, that the round arches appear including a row of pointed ones (wch you mention, &amp; wch I also observed) similar to
					those in St Sepulchre's Chappel, tho' far inferior in the proportions &amp; neatness of workmanship. the same thing is repeated in the
					North-transept, but this is only an imitation of the other, done for the sake of regularity, for this part of the building is no older
					than Archb:p Romaine,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2036tm" /> who came to the See in 1285, &amp; died 1295.</p>
				<p>All the buildings of Henry the 2ds time (under whom Roger lived &amp; died, 1185) are of a clumsey &amp; heavy proportion, with a few
					rude &amp; awkward ornaments, &amp; this style continues to the beginning of Henry 3d's reign, tho' with a little improvement, as in
					the Nave of Fountain's-Abbey, &amp;c: then all at once come in the tall piqued arches, the light clusterd columns, the capitals of
					curling foliage, the fretted tabernacles &amp; vaultings, &amp; a profusion of statues, &amp;c: that constitute the good Gothic style,
					together with decreasing &amp; flying buttresses, &amp; pinnacles, on the outside. nor must you conclude any thing from Roger's own
					tomb, wch has (I remember) a wide surbased arch with scallop'd ornaments, &amp;c: for this can be no older than the Nave itself, wch
					was built by A:p Melton<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2037tm" /> after the year 1315, 130 years after our Roger's death.</p>
				<p>I have [ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2038tm" /> pray come &amp; tell me your mind, tho' I know you will be as weary of me as a dog,
					because I can't play upon the glasses,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2039tm" /> nor work Joyner's work, nor draw my own picture.</p>

				<p> I am desired by Count Algarotti to forward the two inclosed Letters to You<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2059tm" /> &amp; M<hi rend="super"
						>r</hi> Mason; and as I am at a loss where to direct to M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason, I take the Liberty of charging you with a
					double Postage on his Account, as well as of begging you to take under your Care the letter directed to him. He the Count has sent two
					or three little treatises<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2060tm" /> of his, that have been lately printed at Leghorn, as a present to you &amp;
						M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason: they are imbarqued in the <hi>Beverley</hi>, Capt<hi rend="super">n</hi> Allen, but will probably be
					delivered to you by an unknown Hand:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2061tm" /> 'tis upon this occasion, he tells me, that he has wrote to you
					both; and if upon the Receipt of his Letter, or of his Books, you think proper to write him an answer, the best direction will be
					this.</p>

				<p>En Italie.</p>
				<p> In my last Letter to M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Brown, Sir, I begged he would return you my best Acknowledgements for the very
					obliging Note with which you had favoured me by his means, and therefore I do not pretend to say any thing more to it here, except
					merely to thank you for the kind thought of transmitting <hi>Ossian the son of Fingal</hi> to me in Italy; but I can now tell you, Sir,
					that I have met with him, and that I have read him, at least Macpherson's English prose translation of Ossian's Poems, which has
					sufficed to give me such an Idea of the Original, as may, I hope, correspond with your declared Opinion of it. Tho' but ill in Health
					at present, next Wednesday Morning I shall set out towards the Ascension at Venice, and afterwards I believe by short Stages, &amp;
					slow Movements to Paris, and the German Spa. You see, Sir, I presume much upon your Goodnature in communicating my concerns to You; if
					too much, blame yourself, Sir, who have encouraged me to it, or excuse it for once from one, who is with the highest Respect</p>

					<salute>Dear Mr Gray </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Stonehewer tells me that you are returnd to Cambridge therefore I trust you are at leisure to read &amp; to answer my letter &amp; to
					tell me what is to be done about the Count &amp; his Coserelles.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2063tm" /> One can't thank him for them I think
					till one has recd them, and for my part I can only thank him in plain English whenever I do it. Pray write me your mind as to this
					matter.</p>
				<p>You can't think what a favrite I am of Mr Bedingfeilds. I might have had an agate &amp; gold snuff-box from him the other day, &amp;
					why think you? only because I gave him an Etching of Mr Gray:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2064tm" /> Lord Sr, says I, would you repay me
					with a thing of this value for a thing not worth three halfpence. What (says he) a portrait of Mr Gray done by Mr Mason of no value!
					&amp;c &amp;c In short he presst me to accept it, till there was hardly any such thing as refusing, however, I refusd to the last, wch
					you will own to be miraculous when you consider my Avarice, my fondness for trinketts, &amp; when I tell you the Box was wonderful
					handsome &amp; withall had a french hinge. This said Gentleman is shortly going to leave York entirely without having resolvd in what
					other place to reside. to say the truth I am not displeas'd at this. for of all the Admirers I have had in my time, I think he would
					tire me the most was I to have much of him. He goes from hence to Norfolk<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2065tm" /> first with his family &amp;
					that some time this next month, &amp; intends you a visit in his way. Get your Arm chair<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2066tm" /> new stufft
					&#x2013; No, the old stuffing will have more inspiration in it. I send you on the other page a Sonnet intended to be prefixt to my
						just<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2067tm" /> volume (Gray Willing) It has I assure you cost me much pains, &amp; yet it is not yet what it
					should be, however I will do no more at it, till you have seen it, &amp; send me your opinion of it.</p>
				<p>I have got about 10 Subscribers to Smart<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2068tm" /> &amp; dont know how to transmit him the money. Stonehewer
					advises me to keep it, as he hears he is in somebodys hands who may cheat him. I have seen his Song to David<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2069tm" /> &amp; from thence conclude him as mad as ever But this I mention only that one should endeavor to assist
					him as affectually as possible wch one cannot do without the mediation of a third person. If you know any body now in London (for
					Stonehewer has left it) whom I can write to on this subject pray tell me. Tis said in the papers he is prosecuting the people who
					confined him.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2070tm" /> if so, assisting him at present is only throwing ones money to the Lawyers. Give my
					Love to Mr Brown &amp; service to the College.</p>

				<p>As I have no more received my little <hi rend="italic">thingumterries,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2075tm" /> than you have yours, tho they were sent by the Beverly,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2076tm" /> Captain
					Allen, I have return'd no answer yet; but I must soon, &amp; that in plain English, and so should you too. in the mean time I borrow'd
					&amp; read them. that on the Opera is a good clever dissertation, dedicated to <hi rend="italic">Guglielmo Pitt.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2077tm" /> the other (<hi rend="italic">Il Congresso di Citera</hi>)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2078tm" /> in
					poetical prose describes the negotiation of three Embassadresses sent by England, France, &amp; Italy to the Court of Cupid to lay
					before him the state of his empire in the three nations, &amp; is not contemptible neither in its kind: so pray be civil to the Count,
					&amp; Signor Howe.</p>
				<p>I think it may be time enough to send poor Smart the money you have been so kind to collect for him, when he has drop'd his law-suit,
					wch I don't doubt must go against him, if he pursues it. Gordon<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2079tm" /> (who lives here) knows, &amp;
					interests himself about him: from him I shall probably know, if he can be persuaded to drop his design. there is a Mr Anguish<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2080tm" /> in Town (with whom, I fancy, you were once acquainted) he probably can best inform you of his condition
					&amp; motions, for I hear, he continues to be very friendly to him. </p>
				<p>When you speak of Mr Bed:ld you have always a dash of gall, that shews your unforgiving temper, only because it was to <hi
						rend="italic">my</hi> great chair,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2081tm" /> that he made the first visit. for this cause you refused the
					snuff-box (wch to punish you I shall accept myself) &amp; for this cause you obstinately adhere to the Church of England.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2082tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I like your Sonnet better than most dedications. it is simple &amp; natural: the best line in it is <q> So to deceive my solitary
						days &amp;c: </q> there are an expression or two, that <hi rend="italic">break the repose</hi> of it by looking common &amp;
					over-worn. <hi rend="italic">sequester'd shade, woodbine sprays, selected lays</hi>:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2083tm" /> I dare not
					mention <hi rend="italic">letter'd ease. Life's vain vision</hi> does not pronounce well. bating these, it looks in earnest, &amp; as
					if you could live at Aston, which is not true; but that is not my affair.</p>
				<p>I have got a Mass of Pergolesi,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2084tm" /> wch is all divinity: but it was lent me, or you should have it. by
					all means send for six Lessons (for the Piano-Forte Harpsichord) of Carlo Bach,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2085tm" /> not the
						Opera-Bach,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2086tm" /> but his Brother. to my fancy they are charming, &amp; in the best Italian style: Mr
						Nevile<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2087tm" /> &amp; the old Musicianers here do not like them, but to me they speak not only musick, but
					passion. I can not play them, tho' they are not hard: yet I make a smattering, that serves &#x2013; <hi rend="italic">to deceive my
						solitary days.</hi> &amp; I figure to myself, that I hear you touch them triumphantly. Adieu! I should like to hear from you.</p>
				<p>The Petit Bon<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2088tm" /> sends his love to you. all the rest (but Dr May<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2089tm" />
					&amp; the Master)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2090tm" /> are dead, or married.</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>You may well wonder at my long taciturnity:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2092tm" /> I wonder too, &amp; know not what cause to assign, for
					it is certain, I think of you daily. I believe, it is owing to the nothingness of my history, for except six weeks that I pass'd in
					Town towards the end of spring, &amp; a little jaunt to Epsom<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2093tm" /> &amp; Box-Hill, I have been here time
					out of mind in a place, where no events grow, tho' we preserve those of former days by way of <hi rend="italic">Hortus Siccus</hi> in
					our libraries. my slumbers were disturbed the other day by an unexpected visit from Mr. W: who dined with me, seem'd mighty happy for
					the time he stay'd, &amp; said he could like to live here:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2094tm" /> but hurried home in the evening to his new
						Gallery,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2095tm" /> wch is all Gothicism, &amp; gold, &amp; crimson, &amp; looking-glass.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2096tm" /> he has purchased at an auction in Suffolk ebony-chairs<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2097tm" /> &amp; old
					moveables enough to load a waggon.</p>
				<p>Mason &amp; I have received letters from Count Algarotti, Chambellan de sa Majeste le Roi de Prusse, with observations, (that is
					panegyricks) on our Tragedies &amp; our Odes, &amp; a present of certain Italian Dissertations, wch he has lately publish'd on the
					state of Painting and Musick. one of them is dedicated to Mr. Pitt, whom he styles &#x2013; <hi rend="italic">Uomo immortale, e
						Restitutore d'Inghilterra, Amico del gran Federigo.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2098tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I was in Town, when Mr Middleton<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2099tm" /> died, &amp; immediately got all the information I could (first
					from St:r &amp; then from your Brother) of the dispositions he had made. I suppose, they are as good as you expected, &amp; tho' the
					prospect is but small, that you should enjoy the benefit of them in your own person, yet that is not impossible; &amp; your Son (I
					think) stands a very good chance, wch can not chuse but open an agreeable prospect to you, in wch I take a part, &amp; congratulate you
					both upon it. I doubt you have not read Rousseau's <hi rend="italic">Emile</hi>:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2100tm" /> every body that has
					children, should read it more than once, for tho' it abounds with his usual glorious absurdity, tho' his general scheme of education be
					an impracticable chimera: yet there are a thousand lights struck out, a thousand important truths better express'd than ever they were
					before, that may be of service to the wisest Man. particularly I think he has observed children with more attention &amp; knows their
					meaning &amp; the working of their little passions better than any other Writer. as to his religious discussions, wch have alarmed the
					world, &amp; engaged their thoughts more than any other part of his book, I set them all at nought, &amp; wish they had been omitted.
					Mrs Jonathan<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2101tm" /> told me, you begun your evening-prayer as soon as I was gone, &amp; that it had a great
					effect upon the congregation: I hope you have not grown weary of it, nor lay it aside, when company comes. poor Mrs. Bonfoy<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2102tm" /> (who taught me to pray) is dead. she struggled near a week against the Iliac Passion (I fear) in great
					torture with all her senses about her, &amp; with much resolution took leave of her physician some days before she expired, &amp; would
					suffer no one to see her afterwards but common Servants. </p>
				<p>You describe Winston<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2103tm" />
					<hi rend="italic">con tanto amore,</hi> that I take it amiss I was not suffer'd to see it, &amp; want to be buried there too. but
					enough of death! I have forgot to tell you that Dr. Long has had an audience of the K: &amp; Queen an hour long at
						Buckingham-House.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2104tm" /> his errand was to present them with a Lyricord<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2105tm" />
					(such a one!) of his own making, &amp; a glass-sphere: he had long been solliciting this honour, wch Ld Bute at last procured him,
					&amp; he is very happy. the K: told him, he bid fair for a century of life at least;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2106tm" /> ask'd him,
					whether he preach'd; why he did not write verses in the Cambridge Collection;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2107tm" /> &amp; what not? The Q.
					spoke French to him, &amp; ask'd, how he liked Handel?</p>
				<p>And I ask you, how you like the present times? whether you had not rather be a Printer's Devil, than a Secretary of State? you are to
					expect (I hear) a new Ministry,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2108tm" /> composed of the Earl of Shelburne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2109tm" />
					Mr Rigby,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2110tm" /> Duke &amp; Dutchess of Bedford,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2111tm" /> Earl Gower,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2112tm" /> &amp;c. which doubtless will give universal satisfaction. the great Ld Holland,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2113tm" /> who is at Paris, being lately asked by a young Man, who was returning home, whether he had any commands in
					England, made no reply but by shrugging up his shoulders, &amp; fetching a deep sigh.</p>
				<p>I kept an exact account of Heat &amp; Cold in the Spring here: the sum &amp; substance of wch is, that (at 9 in the morning) on the
					18th of January, the Therm: was at 31, &amp; the small birds were so tame you might take them up with your hand. this was the greatest
					cold. on the 15th of April it was at 58, &amp; the same afternoon at 65, wch was the greatest heat from Jan: 1 to May 1st. </p>

				<p>I see with great satisfaction your efforts to reunite the congenial arts of Poetry, Musick, &amp; the Dance, wch with the assistance

						>Virtuosa,</hi> destroy her caprice &amp; impertinence without hurting her talents, or command those unmeaning graces &amp; tricks of

				<p>One cause that so long has hindered, &amp; (I fear) will hinder that happy union, wch you propose, seems to me to be this: that
					Poetry (wch, as you allow, must lead the way, &amp; direct the operations of the subordinate Arts) implies at least a liberal
					education, a degree of literature, &amp; various knowledge, whereas the others (with a few exceptions) are in the hands of Slaves &amp;
					Mercenaries, I mean, of People without education, who, tho neither destitute of Genius, nor insensible to fame, must yet make gain
					their principal end, &amp; subject themselves to the prevailing taste of those, whose fortune only distinguishes them from the
					Multitude. </p>
				<p>I cannot help telling you, that 8 or 10 years ago,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2122tm" /> I was a witness of the power of your comic
					musick. there was a little troop of Buffi, that exhibited a Burletta in London, not in the Opera-House, where the audience is chiefly
					of the better sort, but in<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2123tm" /> one of the common theatres full of all kinds of people &amp; (I believe)
					the fuller from that natural aversion we bear to Foreigners: their looks &amp; their noise made it evident, they did not come thither
					to hear; &amp; on similar occasions I have known candles lighted, broken bottles, &amp; penknives flung on the stage, the benches torn
					up, the scenes hurried into the street &amp; set on fire. the curtain drew up, the musick was of Cocchi with a few airs of Pergolesi
					interspersed. the Singers were (as usual) deplorable, but there was one Girl (she call'd herself the Niccolina)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2124tm" /> with little voice &amp; less beauty; but with the utmost justness of ear, the strongest expression of
					countenance, the most speaking eyes, the greatest vivacity &amp; variety of gesture. her first appearance instantly fix'd their
					attention; the tumult sunk at once, or if any murmur rose, it was soon hush'd by a general cry for silence. her first air ravish'd
					every body; they forgot their prejudices, they forgot, that they<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2125tm" /> did not understand a word of the
					language; they enter'd into all the humour of the part, made her repeat all her songs, &amp; continued their transports, their
					laughter, &amp; applause to the end of the piece. within these three last years the Paganina<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2126tm" /> &amp;
						Amici<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2127tm" /> have met with almost the same applause once a week from a politer audience on the Opera-stage.
					the truth is, the Opera itself, tho supported here<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2128tm" /> at a great expence for so many years, has rather
					maintain'd itself by the admiration bestow'd on a few particular voices, or the borrow'd taste of a few Men of condition, that have
					learn'd in Italy how to admire, than by any genuine love we bear to the best Italian musick: nor have we yet got any style of our own,
					&amp; this I attribute in great measure to the language, wch in spite of its energy, plenty, &amp; the crowd of excellent Writers this
					nation has produced, does yet (I am sorry to say it) retain too much of its barbarous original to adapt itself to musical composition.
					I by no means wish to have been born any thing but an Englishman; yet I should rejoice to exchange tongues with Italy.</p>
				<p>Why this Nation has made no advances hitherto in painting &amp; sculpture is hard to say. the fact is undeniable, &amp; we have the
					vanity to apologize for ourselves, as Virgil did for the Romans, <hi rend="italic">Excudent alii,</hi> &amp;c:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2129tm" /> it is sure that Architecture had introduced itself in the reign of the unfortunate Charles the first, &amp;
					Inigo Jones has left us some few monuments of his skill,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2130tm" /> that shew him capable of greater things.
					Charles had not only a love for the beautiful arts, but some taste in them. the confusion, that soon follow'd, swept away his
					magnificent collection, the artists were dispersed or ruin'd, &amp; the arts disregarded till very lately. the young Monarch now on the
					throne is said to esteem &amp; understand them: I wish he may have the leisure to cultivate, &amp; the skill to encourage them with due
					regard to merit, otherwise it is better to neglect them. You, Sr, have pointed out the true Sources &amp; the best examples to your
					Countrymen. they have nothing to do, but to be what they once were; and yet perhaps it is more difficult to restore Goodtaste to a
					nation, that has degenerated, than to introduce it in one, where as yet it has never flourish'd. you are generous enough to wish, &amp;
					sanguine enough to foresee, that it shall one day flourish in England. I too must wish, but can hardly extend my hopes so far. it is
					well for us that you do not see our publick exhibitions &#x2013; but our Artists are yet in their infancy, &amp; therefore I will not
					absolutely despair. </p>
				<p>I owe to Mr Howe<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2131tm" /> the honour I have of conversing with Count Algarotti, &amp; it seems as if I meant
					to indulge myself in the opportunity: but I have done, Sr:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2132tm" /> I will only add, that I am proud of your
					approbation having no relish for any other fame than what is confer'd by the few real Judges, that are so thinly scatter'd over the
					face of the earth.</p>

					little point, in wch he does not do us justice.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2138tm" /> I am the more sollicitous about it, because it
					relates to the only Taste we can call our own, the only proof of our original talent in matter of pleasure; I mean, our skill in
					gardening, &amp; laying out grounds. that the Chinese have this beautiful Art in high perfection, seems very probable from the Jesuit's
						Letters,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2139tm" /> &amp; more from Chambers's little discourse<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2140tm" /> publish'd
					some few years ago. but it is very certain, we copied nothing from them, nor had any thing but nature for our model. it is not forty
					years, since the Art was born among us; and it is sure, that there was nothing in Europe like it, &amp; as sure, we then had no

					<salute> Sir. </salute>
				</opener>
				<p> I was made happy in the receipt of your Favour<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2177tm" /> last Thursday morning, the 22<hi rend="super"
						>d</hi> of September — and I now take the liberty of addressing you again not with a view of Challenging an answer (since a word to
						M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Brown will suffice in its stead) but partly to thank you for the favour already received, and partly from a
					consideration of self-interest, which you will easily discover in the course of reading this. Your Letter to Count Algarotti<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2178tm" /> I forwarded the very next morning, taking upon me to mention to him at the same time, (and that in the
					strongest terms, which his friendship for me and kind partiality in my favour might warrant) your Objection to the Passage in the
						<hi>Essay upon the Opera in Musick</hi>
					<hi>'Dai Cinesi presano singolarmente gl'Inglesi quel Gusto</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2179tm" /> I even went so far
					as to beg for an Alteration in the next edition of his Works, provided his Conscience would permit him to subscribe to a Change of
					Sentiment or at least to a softening of Expression. Should he have taken up the opinion upon conjecture from circumstances of apparent
					probability, or from any thing dropt in the very book of Chambers,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2180tm" /> which you mention, or perhaps even
					from an Assertion in <hi>Italian</hi> Conversation, I have not the least doubt, but he will readily restore her due to the <hi>old
						England</hi> of which he talks so much, especially as he has learned the Art of confessing an errour with a good grace, and is to the
					last degree ingenuous in so doing.</p>
				<p> I am tempted now, Sir, to trespass upon your indulgence with a familiarity somewhat too great, and yet I hesitate in doing it. It
					seems clear to me from the force &amp; extent of the eulogy you bestow upon Count Algarotti, that he has gained your approbation as a
					man of true taste, and as an author: taking this for granted, let me suppose that an Edition of all C. Algarotti's works was
					practicable in England,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2181tm" /> would it be likely to be acceptable to the lovers of Italian Literature,
					&amp; to the sensible few? allowing this too in the affirmative, let me suppose again, that the Author would give me all possible
					encouragement, and Assistance in the prosecution of such an Undertaking, would you think me a madman for letting the thought enter into
					my Head! You would, I doubt not, and I am sure, with good reason, if I had any Idea of obtruding upon the Publick one line of my own,
					either by way of note, or in what way soever. This I have not, I promise you, and beg with warmth (as you know <hi>what I was</hi>
					before I left England, and I am sure that <hi>I am not</hi> improved since,) that you would not pronounce me at once an <hi>improved
						Coxcomb</hi>. I flatter myself, that the Author would ease me of almost all the trouble upon this occasion, since he has already put
					into my Hands with manuscript Corrections, &amp; notes the last edition of a very favourite work of his, viz, <hi>the Congress of
						Cythera</hi>, which if you have not seen,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2182tm" /> I hope to have the pleasure of lending you as soon as ever
					I arrive in England.</p>
				<p> You would ask me perhaps, in what manner I would propose printing these works, which would make at least four moderate Volumes in
					Octavo: not by subscription, I assure you, nor should any of my Friends ever be sollicited even to purchase them, if they were not of
					their own accord inclined to do so. In short, Sir, I would risk no small expence in such an attempt, since I know my <hi>estate</hi> is
					in much better condition for it than my <hi>Headpiece</hi>. I think I have now said enough to provoke you to a word of opinion &amp;
					advice upon this business: at least, if I have not, I must defer begging this favour of you more at large, till I have a properer
					opportunity, for I am writing late by Candle-light, and with such a draw-back of Pain upon me, that I find it no matter of ease to hold
					out any longer. I intend writing to Mr Brown (whose letter I have received) by the next post, and should your good-nature induce you to
					desire more particular Intelligence about me, my concerns, or Motions, M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Brown will have nothing else in his
					Letter, but what is upon this subject, the most important one in the world to all of us either in writing or Conversing.</p>

				<p>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2189tm" /> I have compared Helvetius &amp; Elfrida, and find thirteen parallel passages, five of which at least
					are so direct &amp; close, as to leave no shadow of a doubt, &amp; therefore confirm all the rest. it is a Phænomenon, that you will be

					All I remember is, that I thought it not at all <hi rend="italic">English,</hi> &amp; did not much like it; and the reason is plain;
					for the lyric flights &amp; choral flowers suited not at all with the circumstances or character, as he had contrived it.<anchor

				<p>Having been upon the ramble, I have neglected all my duties, in hopes of finding pleasures in their room; which, after all (as you
					know well), one never finds. My conscience reproaches me with your obliging letter; and would (I really think) carry me into
					Somersetshire, did not poverty and winter stare me in the face, and bid me sit still. I well remember Dr. Ross's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2198tm" /> kind invitation, and in better days still hope to accept it. Doubt not but my inclinations will be
					quickened by the hopes I entertain of seeing you in so many new lights; the travelled Mr. Robinson, with a thousand important airs and
					graces, so much <hi rend="italic">virtù,</hi> so much <hi rend="italic">scavoir-vivre!</hi> the husband, the father, the rich
					clergyman, warm, snug, and contented as a bishop. My mouth waters: but sure &#x2013; the family will be in town this winter, and I
					shall see you there in November. Is this the fine autumn you promised me? Oh! I hear you (not curse: you must not, but) ... this
					untoward climate. I doubt not but you write to Mason, though he does not tell me so. There is he, repining at his four-and-twenty weeks
					residence at York, unable to visit his bowers, the work of his own hands, at Aston, except in the depth of winter; and longing for the
					fleshpots and coffee-houses of Cambridge. There is nobody contented but you and I &#x2013; oh yes, and Dr. Ross; who (I shrewdly
					suspect) is the happiest of the three.</p>

				<p>As in the Letter, with which you honoured me of late,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2200tm" /> you expressed a sollicitude about the
					imputation, laid upon us by Count Algarotti, of a borrowed taste in our method of laying out Grounds, this, I think, may well warrant,

				<p>'Mi spiace solamente, che quella critica concernente i Giardini Inglesi, non la abbia fatta a me medesimo; quasi egli dovesse
					credermi più amico della mia opinione che della Verità. Ecco, come ho cangiato quel luogo. Dopo le parole <hi rend="italic">nel tesser
						la favola di un poema.</hi>
				</p>
				<p>'Simili ai giardini della Cina sono quelli, che piantano gl'Inglesi <hi rend="italic">dietro al medesimo modello della Natura.</hi>
					Quanto ella ha di vago, e di vario, boschetti, collinette, acque vive, praterie con dei tempietti, degli obelischi, ed anche di belle

						xml:id="id_tg2a.2202tm" /> che hanno di tanto sorpassato il le Nautre,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2203tm" /> tenuto già il maestro
					dell'Architettura, dirò così, de' Giardini. Dalle ville d'Inghilterra ne è sbandita la simmetria Francese, i più bei siti pajono
					naturali, il culto è misto col negletto, e il disordine, che vi regna, è l'effetto dell'arte la meglio ordinata.'</p>
				<p>May I take the Liberty of remarking here, Sir, that every Author of a reputation so established will not <hi rend="italic">quite
						so</hi> easily, so readily, and so explicitly give up his own opinion in deference to that of another, or even to conviction itself?
					nor perhaps would <hi rend="italic">he</hi> so soon have kissed the rod from any vulgar Hand; but he is thoroughly informed <hi
						rend="italic">to whose</hi> correction he submits. &#x2013; I find you had enclosed a letter from Mr Mason to Count Algarotti, in
					which he (Mr Mason) complains that he had not then received the three little treatises destined for him: if it were not too much
					trouble, I could wish you would be kind enough to enquire of Mr Mason, whether he has not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> received them;
					for, if He has not, I will take care that he either shall have them, or others in their stead. Let me further petition you, Sir, to
					present my best Compliments to Mr Brown, and tell him, that I begin to <hi rend="italic">keep a sharp look out</hi> every time the
					letter-carrier passes by my Windows in hopes of having news from Pembroke Hall, and the more so, to confess the truth, because I am
					rather anxious to hear something from You, Sir, upon the principal Subject of my last Letter.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2204tm" /> Perhaps
					Mr Brown may have been apprehensive, that a simple direction to me at <hi rend="italic">Brussels</hi> may not have been sufficient to
					secure his Letter from miscarriage; but besides, that I generally take especial pains to get into the good graces of the People of the
					Post-Office, there is only one general Office for the Letters from all Parts. Upon looking over Count Algarotti's Letter once more, I
					find another paragraph, that I think, will give you pleasure. 'La mia salute è presentemente assai rimessa; di maniera che io vado a
					Pisa più per piacere, che per bisogno. Soltanto che io sia riserbato nel mangiare (cosa per me un poco difficile) io credo che starò
					assai bene; e il migliore uso che potrò fare della mia salute, sarà il fare il viaggio d'Inghilterra.'<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2205tm"

				<p>I am ashamed of my own indolence in not answering your former letter:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2207tm" /> a second,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2208tm" /> wch I have since received, adds to my shame, &amp; quickens my motions. I can see no manner of objection to
					your design of publishing C: A:s<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2209tm" /> works compleat in your own country. it will be an evidence of your
					regard for him, that can not but be very acceptable to him. the Glasgow-Press,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2210tm" /> or that of
						Baskervile,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2211tm" /> have given specimens of their art equal (at least) in beauty to any thing, that Europe
					can produce. the expence you will not much regard on such an occasion, &amp; (if you suffer them to be sold) that would be great
					diminish'd, and most probably reimbursed. as to notes (and I think, some will be necessary) I easily believe you will not overload the
					text with them, &amp; besides every thing of that kind will be concerted between you. if you propose any Vignettes or other matters of
					ornament, it would be well they were design'd in Italy, &amp; the gravings executed either there, or in France, for in this country
					they are woeful &amp; beyond measure dear. the revising of the Press must be your own labour, as tedious as it is inglorious: but to
					this you must submit. as we improve in our types, &amp;c: we grow daily more negligent in point of correctness, &amp; this even in our
					own tongue. what will it be in the Italian?</p>
				<p>I did not mean, you should have told C: A: my objection,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2212tm" /> at least not as from me, who have no
					pretence to take such a liberty with him: but I am glad, he has alter'd the passage. he can not wonder, if I wish'd to save to our
					nation the only honour it has in matters of Taste, &amp; no small one, since neither Italy nor France have ever had the least notion of
					it, nor yet do at all comprehend it, when they see it. Mr Mason has received the books in question from an unknown hand, wch I take to
					be Mr Holles,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2213tm" /> from whom I too have received a beautiful set of Engravings, as a present; I know not
					why, unless as a Friend of yours. I saw &amp; read the beginning of this year the <hi rend="italic">Congresso di Citéra,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2214tm" /> &amp; was excessively pleased in spite of prejudice, for I am naturally no friend to allegory, nor
					to poetical prose. <hi rend="italic">entre nous</hi> what gives me the least pleasure of any of his writings, that I have seen, is the
						<hi rend="italic">Newtonianism.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2215tm" /> it is so direct an imitation of Fontenelle,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2216tm" /> a Writer not easy to
					imitate, &amp; least of all in the Italian tongue, whose character &amp; graces are of a higher style &amp; never adapt themselves
					easily to the elegant <hi rend="italic">badinage</hi> and <hi rend="italic">legereté</hi> of conversation, that sets so well on the
					French: but this is a secret between us.</p>
				<p>I am glad to hear, he thinks of revisiting England tho' I am a little ashamed of my country at this present. our late-acquired glory
					does not set becomingly upon us; &amp; even the Author of it, that <hi rend="italic">Restitutor d'Inghilterra,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2217tm" /> is doing God knows what! if he should deign to follow the track of vulgar Ministers, &amp; regain
					his power by ways injurious to his fame, whom can we trust hereafter?</p>
				<p>M: de Nivernois<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2218tm" /> on his return to France, says (I hear) of England, Quel Roy, quel Peuple, quelle

				<p>The BP<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2223tm" /> has vanity enough to make him feel at some time or other, what Posterity will think of him:

					were any other devil, but he. yet he would be chose at present, I have little doubt, tho' with strong opposition, &amp; in a

				<p>Do, oblige me with a change in the Ministry: I mean, something one may tell, that looks as if it were near at hand; or if there is no

					<salute>Dear Doctor</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>If the ill-news be true, wch your last letter to Mr Brown makes very probable, I am heartily sorry for the loss you have had of poor
					Mr R: Wharton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2230tm" /> as I am sure you can not but feel it very sensibly in many respects.</p>
				<p>I have indeed been very remiss in writing to you, nor can alledge any other excuse for it but the lowness of spirits, wch takes from
					me the power of doing every thing I ought: this is not altogether without cause, for eversince I went last to Town, in the beginning of
					November I have suffer'd a good deal from <hi rend="italic">a complaint,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2231tm" /> wch I have often mention'd to you, &amp; which is now grown almost constant. I have left off wine,
					eat less than common, have made use of the common applications in such cases, &amp; am now taking soap: yet find no essential amendment
					in myself, so that I have but an uncomfortable prospect before me, even if things remain as they are: but (I own) what I apprehend, is
					still worse.</p>
				<p>Mason has pass'd three weeks here<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2232tm" /> with me in his way to Town. the general report was, that he was
					going to be married<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2233tm" /> out of hand: but I find it was only a faint sort of tendency that way, that may
					or may not come to something of maturity just as the season of the year shall incline him. the best I can tell you of her is, that she
					is no fine Lady, &amp; the worst, that her fortune is not large. now you know it might have been a fine Lady with no money at all. he
					still talks of visiting Old-Park before he is tied down to his Summer-Residence. </p>
				<p>This silly dirty Place has had all its thoughts taken up with chusing a new High-Steward, &amp; had not Ld Hardwick surprisingly
					&amp; to the shame of the Faculty recover'd by a Quackmedicine,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2234tm" /> I believe in my conscience the noble
					Earl of Sandwich had been chosen, tho' (let me do them the justice to say) not without a considerable opposition. his principal Agents
					are Dr Brook<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2235tm" /> of St. Johns, Mr Brocket,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2236tm" /> &amp; Dr Long,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2237tm" /> whose old Tory notions, that had long lain by neglected &amp; forgotten, are brought out again &amp;
					furbish'd for present use, tho' rusty &amp; out of joint, like his own Spheres &amp; Orreries. their crests are much fallen, &amp;
					countenances lengthen'd by the transactions of last week,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2238tm" /> for the Ministry on Tuesday last (after
					sitting till near eight in the morning) carried a small point by a majority of only 40, &amp; on another previous division by one of 10
					only; &amp; on Friday last (at five in the morning) there were 220 to 234, &amp; by this the Court only obtain'd to adjourn the debate
					for four months, &amp; not to get any declaration in favour of their measures. if they hold their ground many weeks after this, I shall
						wonder:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2239tm" /> but the new reign has already produced many wonders. the other House I hear will soon take
					in hand a book lately publish'd by some scoundrel Lawyer on the Prerogative, in wch is scraped together all the flattery &amp;
					blasphemy of our old Lawbooks in honour of Kings.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2240tm" /> I presume, it is understood, that the Court will
					support the cause of this impudent Scribler. there is another impudent Fellow<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2241tm" /> of the same profession,
					but somewhat more conspicuous by his place (a Friend of yours, with whom I sup'd at your house ten or eleven years ago) that has gain'd
					to himself the most general &amp; universal detestation of any Man perhaps in this age. I congratulate you on your acquaintance with
					him.</p>
				<p>Mr Brown is preparing your grafts,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2242tm" /> wch are to be sent about a week hence, for that is the proper
					time: but as your parcels used to be carried to your Brother's, we are afraid they may be neglected there in the present confusion. if
					you think so, you will direct him forthwith to whom he may address them.</p>
				<p>Pray tell me (when you are at leisure) all the transactions &amp; improvements of Old-Park, that I may rectify &amp; model my Ideas
					accordingly. what has become of you in these inundations, that have drown'd us all, &amp; in this hot &amp; unseasonable winter?
					present my respects to Mrs Wharton, &amp; my compliments to Miss.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2243tm" /> how do the little family do?</p>

				<p>You are very perverse &amp; mysterious about your discoveries: but I hope to be satisfied next month. you never said a word about Mr

					<salute>My Dear Doctor</salute>
				</opener>
				<p> I do remember &amp; shall ever remember, as I ought, your extreme kindness in offering to be present, &amp; to assist me in the <hi
						rend="italic">perilous hour.</hi> when I received your letter, I was pleased to find, I had done every thing almost, that you advised.
					the fault lay in deferring matters too long. upon inspection they found no reason to apprehend a Fistula, but the piles only in an
					extreme degree, that threaten'd mortification. 9 or 10 strokes of the lancet, &amp; the application of a caustic, with fomentations
					innumerable I suffer'd manfully: indeed the pain in idea is much greater than in reality, &amp; now I am glad, I know it. it is
					certain, I am better at present, than I had been in at least a year before the operation. I should tell you, that for some days before
					I submitted to it, I had taken soap in large quantities, &amp; for ought I know the inflammation might be rather increased by it. Dr.
						Whytt<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2267tm" /> (I remember) speaking of the use of Limewater &amp; Soap, says, that if the Patient be subject
					to the piles, he must omitt the latter. towards the end of my confinement, during wch (you may believe) I lived on nothing, came the
					Gout in one foot, but so tame you might have stroked it;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2268tm" /> such a <hi rend="italic">Minikin</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2269tm" /> you might have play'd with it. in 3 or 4 days it disappear'd.</p>
				<p>It was true, as Stonhewer told you, that I had a great tendency towards Old-Park &amp; Hart-le-pool: but on prudent consideration I
					find, I can not well afford it, &amp; must defer that pleasure to another summer.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2270tm" /> the Minikin &amp; I
					act upon the same principles: she can not be a river, nor I a Traveller, without money. if we had but a <hi rend="italic">head,</hi> we
					should both of us make a figure in the world.</p>
				<p>Mason does not seem very impatient,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2271tm" /> for he writes word, that he is busy in modelling antique vases
					in clay, &amp; in reading a course of ecclesiastical History, when I expected <hi rend="italic">consummation,</hi> &amp; was praying
					heaven to give him a good &amp; gentle Gouverness: no Man wants such a thing more in all senses; but his greatest wants do not make him
					move a foot the faster, nor has he properly speaking any thing one can call a passion about him, except a little malice &amp;
					revenge.</p>
				<p>Our Election here is in Westminster-Hall:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2272tm" /> but it is not likely that any great matter can be done in
					it till Michaelmas-Term next. in the meantime Ld Sandw: &amp; his Friends do what they can to keep up an interest &amp; a bustle. here
					is a poor Scribler, that he hires to write a weekly paper call'd <hi rend="italic">the Scrutator,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2273tm" /> who by abuse of characters does all in his power to provoke people: but can not so much as get
					himself answer'd. I could not find any one in Town, that ever heard of it (tho' the subject is well known there), &amp; if any body saw
					its name in the advertisements, I believe, they only took it for a <hi rend="italic">Scrutore</hi> to be sold. the Nation is in the
					same hands as the University, &amp; really does not make so manful a resistance. grumble indeed every one does, but since Wilkes's
					affair they fall off their metal, &amp; seem to shrink under the brazen hand of Norton<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2274tm" /> &amp; his
					Collegues. I hear there will be no parliament till after Christmas.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2275tm" /> if the French should be so unwise
					as to suffer the Spanish Court to go on in their present measures (for they refuse to pay the ransom of Manilla,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2276tm" /> &amp; have driven away our Logwood-cutters<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2277tm" /> already) down go their friends
					the Ministry, &amp; all the schemes of Right Divine &amp; Prerogative; and this is perhaps the best chance we have. are you not struck
					with the great similarity there is between the first years of Charles the first, &amp; the present times? who would have thought it
					possible five years ago?</p>
				<p>That old Rogue Ld Bath is dead at last.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2278tm" /> I understood the contest for his spoils lay between your
					noble Friend at Raby<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2279tm" /> &amp; Mr Coleman,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2280tm" /> the Comick Poet, but whether
					they are fallen to either of them I have not heard as yet. pray what is the policy of that castle? the elder Brother lives more than
					usual in the country, as if he were not in the best humour with his Friends at Court, &amp; the younger<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2281tm"
					 /> has been at times an Orator in the opposition? have they been disobliged, or do they fear to disoblige their former friends, who
					may come into play again? </p>
				<p>Two more volumes of Buffon<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2282tm" /> are come over: I mention them in case you chuse to have them. I know of
					nothing else, except half a dozen new works of that inexhaustible, eternal, entertaining Scribler Voltaire,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2283tm" /> who at last (I fear) will go to heaven, for to him entirely it is owing, that the King of France &amp; his
					Council have review'd &amp; set aside the decision of the Parliament of Thoulouse in the affair of Calas.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2284tm" /> the poor Man, 'tis true, has been broke on the wheel long ago: but his Widow &amp; wretched family may have
					some reparation &amp; his Murtherers may smart a little for it. you see a Scribler may be of some use in the world!</p>
				<p>If you see Stonhewer at his return from Buxton, be so good to tell him, that there will be only 200 copies of Ld Herbert's
						Life<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2285tm" /> printed, half of which are for Ld Powis,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2286tm" /> &amp; the rest will
					be given away only. if I happen to have two (wch I do not expect) he shall have one of them.</p>
				<p>Ah! poor James Lyon!<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2287tm" /> &#x2014;how do the &#x2013; Family<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2288tm" /> bear it?
					my best respects to the Lady of Old-Park (the Dutchess I should say) &amp; Lady Mary,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2289tm" /> &amp;c: I hope
					they are all well. are Mr and Mrs Jonathan<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2290tm" /> with you? do you say your prayers o' nights?<anchor

				<p> I am extremely concerned at the account you give me of poor Dolly's sufferings. the severeness of the pain makes me believe, that
					(when you wrote) her distemper was drawing to its crisis, &amp; the abscess might find a vent of itself, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> is
					most to be wish'd.</p>
				<p> I am no friend to Surgeons, &amp; in this case particularly, (as the seat of her malady is so near a very tender part, that is not
					to be trifled with,) I should by no means suffer them to proceed to any operation without the Professor's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2299tm" /> inspection &amp; advice. if he declares it necessary, let her not be frighted at the sight of steel, for I
					can tell her upon some experience,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2300tm" /> that one half-hour of the pain she undergoes from her illness is
					much more, than all she will suffer from M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Thackeray's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2301tm" /> hand. I talk as
					supposing it still to come, but perhaps it is all over, &amp; I may congratulate her on having got rid of this evil, &amp; with it of
					those illnesses she has suffer'd so much from these two years, for it is possible Nature may have found out this means to free her from
					those complaints. I heartily wish her well, &amp; hope to hear again from you soon.</p>
				<p> I have been detain'd in Town till now, &amp; go not to Southampton till Wednesday. when I get thither, I shall let M<hi rend="super"
						>r</hi> Brown know, where I am lodged, &amp; you will send your letter to him to direct.</p>

					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I received your letter, before I left London, &amp; sit down to write to you after the finest walk in the finest day, that ever
					shone, to Netley-Abbey, my old friend, with whom I long'd to renew my acquaintance.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2306tm" /> my Ferryman (for
					one passes over a little arm of the sea about 1/2 a mile) assured me, he would not go near it in the night-time for all the world, tho'
					he knew much money had been found there. the sun was <hi rend="italic">all too glaring &amp; too full of gauds</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2307tm" /> for such a scene, wch ought to be visited only in the dusk of the evening. it stands in a little
					quiet valley, wch gradually rises behind the ruin into a half-circle crown'd with thick wood. before it on a descent is a thicket of
					oaks, that serves to veil it from the broad day &amp; from profane eyes, only leaving a peep on both sides, where the sea appears
					glittering thro' the shade, &amp; vessels with their white sails, that glide across &amp; are lost again. concealed behind the thicket
					stands a little Castle (also in ruins) immediately on the shore, that commands a view over an expanse of sea clear &amp; smooth as
					glass (when I saw it), with Southampton &amp; several villages 3 miles off to the right, Calshot-Castle<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2308tm"
					 /> at 7 miles distance, &amp; the high lands of the Isle of Wight to the left, &amp; in front the deep shades of the New-Forest
					distinctly seen, because the water is no more than three miles over. the Abbey was never very large. the shell of its church is almost
					entire, but the pillars of the iles are gone, &amp; the roof has tumbled in, yet some little of it is left in the transept, where the
					ivy has forced its way thro', &amp; hangs flaunting down among the fretted ornaments &amp; escutcheons of the Benefactors. much of the
					lodgings &amp; offices are also standing, but all is overgrown with trees &amp; bushes, &amp; mantled here &amp; there with ivy, that
					mounts over the battlements.</p>
				<p>In my way I saw Winchester-Cathedral again with pleasure, and sup'd with Dr Balguy,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2309tm" /> who, I
					perceive, means to govern the Chapter. they give 200£ a year to the Poor of the City: his present scheme is to take away this, for it
					is only an encouragement to laziness. but what do they mean to do with it? that indeed I omitted to enquire, because I thought, I knew.
					I saw <hi rend="italic">St Cross</hi> too, the almshouse of <hi rend="italic">noble Poverty</hi> (so it was call'd), founded by Henry
					de Blois,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2310tm" /> &amp; Cardinal Beaufort.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2311tm" /> it maintains 9 decay'd <hi
						rend="italic">Footmen,</hi> &amp; a Master (Chancellor Hoadley)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2312tm" /> who has 800£ a year out of it.</p>
				<p>This place is still full of <hi rend="italic">Bathers.</hi> I know not a Soul, nor have once been at the rooms. the walks all round
					it are delicious, &amp; so is the weather. lodgings very dear &amp; fish very cheap. here is no Coffeehouse, no Bookseller, no
					Pastry-Cook: but here is the Duke of Chandos.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2313tm" /> I defer my politicks. My service to Mr Talbot,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2314tm" /> Gould,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2315tm" /> &amp;c., &amp; to Mr Howe,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2316tm" /> if

				<p>Since I have been here, I have received from you, &amp; by your means, five letters. that from Pa:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2318tm" />
					I could wish, you had open'd; as I know, you by your good will would have done. the sum of it is, that he is at Geneva with the Rhone
					tumbling its blew &amp; green tide directly under his window. that he has pass'd a fortnight in the Pais de Vaux, &amp; the Cantons of
					Bern, Fribourg, &amp; Soleurre, &amp; return'd by the Lake of Neufchatel. that the whole country &amp; particularly the last-named
					appear'd to him astonishingly beautiful. he enquired much after Rousseau,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2319tm" /> but did not meet with him.
					his residence is at <hi rend="italic">Moitier</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2320tm" />
					<hi rend="italic">au Travers</hi> about 4 Leagues from Neufchatel, where he lives in great plenty, the Booksellers at the Hague being
					his Bank, &amp; ready to answer any sum he draws for. it is amazing, what he got by his two last books.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2321tm"
					 /> he is often flying about from village to village, generally wears a sort of Armenian dress,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2322tm" /> &amp;
					posses for a kind of Misanthrope, but is held in great veneration by the people.</p>
				<p>He says, he saw all the matters that come in course in France, &amp; was greatly disappointed. the only thing he mentions is the
					Church at Amiens, wch was really fine. they set out in a few days (his date is 19 Sept:) &amp; go by Chamberry to Turin, from whence he
					will write to you. his letter (he says) is not worth the postage, but it is the abundance, &amp; not the want, of matter, that makes it
					so poor.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2323tm" />
				</p>
				<p>After this what shall I say to you of my Lilliputian travels? on Monday<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2324tm" /> I think to see Salisbury,
					&amp; to be sure Wilton, &amp; Amesbury &amp; Stone-henge. this will take up three days, &amp; then I come back hither, &amp; think to
					be in London on Saturday or Monday after.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2325tm" /> for the weather grows untoward, &amp; the Sea (that is this
					little miniature of it, Southampton-River) rages horribly, &amp; looks as if it would eat one. else I should have gone to Lymington
					&amp; Christchurch, &amp; call'd upon Mr Mansfield<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2326tm" /> in the New-forest to see the Bow, that kill'd
					William Rufus, wch he pretends to possess. (say not a word of Andover!<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2327tm" /> ) my Ld Delawar has erected a

					years old, &amp; is now building a Palazzino here hard by in a delightful spot call'd <hi rend="italic">Bellevue,</hi> &amp; has lately
					produced a natural Son to inherit it. what do you say to poor Iwan,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2333tm" /> &amp; the last Russ Manifesto?
					will no body kill me that Dragoness?<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2334tm" /> must we wait, till her Son<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2335tm" />
					does it himself.</p>
				<p>Mr St: has been at Glamis.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2336tm" /> he tells me no news. he only confutes a piece of news I sent him, wch I
					am glad to hear, is a lye. I must tell you a small anecdote I just hear, that delights me. Sr F: Norton<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2337tm"

					imagined that every thing was agreed on, he insisted on having two pictures as fixtures, wch they value at 60£. so Mrs Norton lives,
					where she did.</p>
				<p>I am sorry for the D: of Devonshire!<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2339tm" /> the cause, I fear is losing ground; &amp; I know the Person

				<p>I am returned from Southampton, since Monday last; have been at Salisbury, Wilton, Stonehenge, and where not, and am not at all the

					Cambridge on Wednesday, if you want him; but, if you do not, would be glad to be prevented by a letter. His intention is only to stay
					there a day or two. He asked me for my rooms, but as I had (intentionally) promised them to Mr. Mapletoft,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2344tm" /> I answered as if I had actually been engaged on that head, and had already wrote to you to say so. If Mr.
					Mapletoft does not come, they are at Mr. Delly's service.</p>
				<p>The present news is that Lady Harriet Wentworth<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2345tm" /> (Lord Rockingham's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2346tm"

				<p>Mr. [M:],<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2348tm" /> who has been in Yorkshire, has seen the future bride.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2349tm" />
					She has just such a nose as Mason has himself; so you see it was made in heaven.</p>
				<p>The rent-roll of the present Duke of Devonshire's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2350tm" /> estate is £44,000 a-year. Lord Richard<anchor

					<salute>Dear Sir</salute>

				<p> I was not able to answer your letter on Saturday, but Delly<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2360tm" /> will certainly be with you on
					Wednesday, good man.</p>
				<p>The Duke of Devonshire for the last fortnight of his life was in a state of infancy. On opening his head there were found two fleshy
					substances that pressed upon the brain &#x2013; the source of his malady. He leaves Devonshire House,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2361tm" />
					with the pictures, furniture, &amp;c., to Lord Richard, his second son, which the present duke may redeem by paying down £20,000; in
					short, to Lord Richard and Lord George<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2362tm" /> (for there are two)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2363tm" /> he gives
					about £4000 a-year apiece; the rest I think I told you before. The majority do not exult upon this death; they are modest and humble,
					being all together by the ears; so, indeed are the minority too. I hear nothing about the Cambridge affair, and you do not tell me
					whether my last news was true; I conclude not, for I am told the Yorkes are very fully and explicitly against the present measures
					&#x2013; even their chief himself.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2364tm" /></p>
				<p> The present talk runs on Lady Harriet Wentworth (that is her name since she married her Irish footman).<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2365tm" /> Your friend the Marquis of Rockingham's sister is a sensible, well-educated woman; twenty-seven years old,
					indeed, and homely enough. O'Brien<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2366tm" /> and his lady (big with child) are embarked for America, to
					cultivate their 40,000 acres of woodland. Before they went, her uncle<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2367tm" /> made him enter himself at
					Lincoln's Inn; I suppose to give him the idea of returning home again.</p>
				<p>I hope not to stay here above a fortnight, but in the meantime should be glad if you would inform me what is the sum total of my
						bill.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2368tm" /></p>

					<p>As I have room, I shall tell you that, on the news of the Duke of Cumberland's illness at Newmarket,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2369tm"
						 /> Lord S.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2370tm" /> coming out of the closet met a great butcherly lord with a white staff,<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg2a.2371tm" /> and, with a countenance very decent and composed to sorrow, told him they had extreme bad news; that his
						Royal Highness the Duke was so ill it was doubtful whether he could live till next day. The other replied, 'Bad news, do you call it?
						By God, I am very glad of it, and shall be to hear the same of all that do not love the King.' </p>
					<p>My service to Mr. T.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2372tm" /> I am glad to hear he is well.</p>

				<p>I received your letter at Southampton, &amp; as I would wish to treat every body according to their own rule &amp; measure of
					good-breeding, have against my inclination waited till now, before I answer'd it, purely out of fear &amp; respect, &amp; an ingenuous
					diffidence of my own abilities. if you will not take this as an excuse, accept it at least as a well-turn'd period, wch is always my
					principal concern. </p>
				<p>So I proceed to tell you, that my health is much improved by the sea; not that I drank of it, or bathed in it, as the <hi
						rend="italic">common people</hi> do: no! I only walk'd by it, &amp; look'd upon it. the climate is remarkably mild, even in Octob:
					&amp; November. no snow has been seen to lie there for these 30 years past. the myrtles grow in the ground against the houses, &amp;
					Guernsey-Lillies bloom in every window. the Town clean &amp; well-built, surrounded by its old stone-walls with their towers &amp;
					gateways, stands at the point of a peninsula, &amp; opens full south to an arm of the sea, wch having form'd two beautiful bays on each
					hand of it stretches away in direct view till it joins the British Channel. it is skirted on either side with gently-rising grounds
					cloath'd with thick wood, &amp; directly cross its mouth rise the high lands of the Isle of Wight at distance, but distinctly seen. in
					the bosom of the woods (conceal'd from profane eyes) lie hid the ruins of Netteleyabbey.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2375tm" /> there may be
					richer &amp; greater houses of religion, but the Abbot is content with his situation. see there at the top of that hanging meadow under
					the shade of those old trees, that bend into a half-circle about it, he is walking slowly (good Man!) &amp; bidding his beads for the
					souls of his Benefactors, interr'd in that venerable pile, that lies beneath him. beyond it (the meadow still descending) nods a
					thicket of oaks, that mask the building, &amp; have excluded a view too garish, &amp; too luxuriant for a holy eye, only on either hand
					they leave an opening to the blew glittering sea. did not you observe how, as that white sail shot by &amp; was lost, he turn'd &amp;
					cross'd himself, to drive the Tempter from him, that had thrown that distraction in his way. I should tell you, that the Ferryman, who
					row'd me, a lusty young Fellow, told me, that he would not for all the world pass a night at the Abbey, (there were such things seen
					near it,) tho' there was a power of money hid there. from thence I went to Salisbury, Wilton, &amp; Stone-Henge,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2376tm" /> but of these things I say no more: they will be publish'd at the University-Press.</p>
				<p>I have been at London this month, that tiresome dull place! where all people under thirty find so much amusement. the Opera with
						Manzuoli<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2377tm" /> in it opens on Saturday, &amp; I go to C: the Wednesday preceding. the Ministry are all
					together by the ears, so are the Opposition: the only doubt is wch will be the weakest: I am afraid, I know. the sentence of
						Alma-Mater,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2378tm" /> of the North-Briton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2379tm" /> &amp; of D'Eon<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2380tm" /> are defer'd. in the mean time Du-Vergy,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2381tm" /> the Adventurer, who enraged D'Eon
					almost to madness, &amp; has been in jail (for debt) eversince December last, having regain'd his liberty by the help (he says) of his
					countrymen declares upon oath, that he was sent from France with a half-promise of being declared Secretary to the Embassy, that he
					might <hi rend="italic">se servir de son epée,</hi> if occasion were, against D'Eon, or at least urge him to do something, that might
					for ever disgrace him. he gives a detail of all his private conversations with G:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2382tm" /> &amp; others on
					this head. Mons: de G: is (I hear) much troubled, declares the whole a lye, but what is he to do? must he have another <hi
						rend="italic">Plaidoyer</hi> in our Courts against this Scoundrel? and indeed from his own narrative he appears to be no better, tho'
					it is interlarded with fine French sentiment about justice &amp; virtue, &amp; honour, &amp; such like.</p>
				<p>I had prepared a finer period than the other to finish with, but d &#x2013; mn it! I have somehow mislaid it among my papers.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2383tm" /> you shall certainly have it next summer. how can people subscribe such a devil of a name (I warrant) you
					call it a <hi rend="italic">christian</hi>-name, to their letters as you do?<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2384tm" /> I always thought at
					times I had a small matter of aversion for you mechanically arising in me, &amp; doubtless this was the reason. fie, fie, put on a
					white satten-mantle, &amp; be carried to church again. however, I forgive you for your Rippon-history's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2385tm"
					 /> sake. Adieu! I shall almost be glad to see you again.</p>

				<p>When your pen was in your hand, you might have been a little more communicative: for, tho' disposed enough to believe the Opposition

					for themselves, or attempting to do, is to me a secret. your canonical book<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2394tm" /> I have been reading with
					great satisfaction. he speaketh as one having authority. if Englishmen have any feeling left, methinks they must feel now; &amp; if the
					Ministry have any feeling (whom no body will suspect of insensibility) they must cut off the Author's ears, for it is in all the forms
					a most wicked libel. is the old Man, &amp; the Lawyer put on, or is it real? or has some real Lawyer furnish'd a good part of the
					materials, &amp; another Person employ'd them? this I guess, for there is an uncouthness of diction in the beginning, wch is not
					supported throughout, though it now &amp; then occurs again, as if the Writer was weary of supporting the character he had assumed,
					when the subject had warmed him beyond dissimulation.</p>
				<p>Rousseau's letters<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2395tm" /> I am reading heavily, heavily! he justifies himself, till he convinces me, that
					he deserved to be burnt, at least that his book<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2396tm" /> did. I am not got thro' him, &amp; you never will.
					Voltaire I detest, &amp; have not seen his book:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2397tm" /> I shall in good time. You surprise me, when you talk
					of going in February:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2398tm" /> pray, does all the Minority go too? I hope, you have a <hi rend="italic"

					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2399tm" /> is a deadly sin in politicks. </p>

					<salute>Dear Mr Mason </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>As you are alone &amp; not quite well, I do feel a little sort of (I am almost ashamed to speak it) tenderness for you: but then I
					comfort myself with the thought, that it does not proceed from any remnant of old inclination or kindness I have for you. that (you
					must allow) would be folly, as our places of abode are so distant, &amp; our occupations &amp; pursuits so different. but the true
					cause is, that I am pretty lonely too, &amp; besides have a complaint in my eyes, that possibly may end in blindness. it consists in
					not being able to read at all with one eye, &amp; having very often the <hi rend="italic">Muscæ Volitantes</hi> before the other. I may
					be allow'd therefore to think a little of you (&amp; Delaval) without any disparagement to my knowledge of Mankind &amp; of human
					Nature.</p>
				<p>The match you talk of is no more consummated than your own, &amp; Kitty<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2401tm" /> is still a Maid for the
						Doctor:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2402tm" /> so that he wants the <hi rend="italic">requisite</hi> thing, &amp; yet (I'll be sworn) his
					happiness is very little impair'd. I take broil'd Salmon to be a dish much more necessary at your table than his. I had heard in Town
					(as you have) that they were married; &amp; long'd to go to Spilsby &amp; make them a visit: but here I learn, it is not true yet,
					whatever it may be. I read &amp; liked the Epigram<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2403tm" /> as it was printed, &amp; do insist, it is better
					without the last lines, not that the thought is amiss, but because the same rhyme is repeated, &amp; the sting is not in the
					epigrammatic style: I mean, not easy &amp; familiar. in a Satyr it might do very well. Mr Churchill is dead indeed,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2404tm" /> drown'd in a butt of claret, wch was tap'd on the meeting of the Friends at Boulogne: he made an excellent
					end, as his Executor Humphrey Cotes<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2405tm" /> testifies. I did not write any of the elegies,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2406tm" /> being busy in writing the <hi rend="italic">Temple of Tragedy.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2407tm" /> send for it forthwith, for you are highly interested in it. if I had not own'd the thing, perhaps
					you might have gone, &amp; taken it for the Revd Mr Langhorne's.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2408tm" /> it is divine!</p>
				<p>I have not read the Philosophic Dictionary.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2409tm" /> I can stay with great patience for any thing that comes
					from Voltaire: they tell me it is frippery &amp; blasphemy &amp; wit. I could have forgiven myself, if I had not read Rousseau's
						letters.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2410tm" /> always excepting the <hi rend="italic">Contract Social,</hi> it is the dullest performance
					he ever publish'd. it is a weak attempt to separate the miracles from the morality of the Gospel: the latter (he would have you think)
					he believes, was sent from God, &amp; the former he very explicitly takes for an imposture. this is in order to prove the cruelty &amp;
					injustice of the State of Geneva in burning his Emile.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2411tm" /> the latter part of his book is to shew the
					abuses, that have crept into the constitution of his countrey, wch point (if you are concerned about it) he makes out very well: and
					his intention in this is plainly to raise a tumult in the City, &amp; to be revenged on the <hi rend="italic">Petit Conseil,</hi> who
					condemn'd his writings to the flames.</p>
				<p>Cambridge itself is fruitful enough of events to furnish out many paragraphs in my Gazette. the most important is, that Frog
						Walker<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2412tm" /> is dead: his last words were (as the Nurses sate by him &amp; said, ah, poor Gentleman, he is
					going!) Going, going, where am I a-going? I'm sure, I know no more than the Man in the moon! Dr Ridlington<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2413tm" /> has been given over with a dropsy these 10 weeks: he refused all tapping &amp; scarifying, but obey'd other
					directions; till finding all was over, he prescribed to himself a boil'd chicken entire, &amp; five quarts of small beer. after this he
					brought up great quantities of blood, the swelling &amp; suffocation &amp; all signs of water disappear'd, his spirits return'd, &amp;
					(except extreme weakness) he is recover'd. every body has ceased to enquire after him, &amp; as he would not die, when he should, they
					are resolved to proceed as if he were dead &amp; buried. Dr Newcome<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2414tm" /> is dead: for 6 weeks or more
					before his death he was distracted, not childish, but really raving. for the last 3 weeks he took no nourishment but by force. Miss
						Kirke<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2415tm" /> &amp; the younger Beadon<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2416tm" /> are Executors &amp; residuary
					Legatees: I believe he left about 10,000£, but there are many legacies. had I a pen of adamant, I could not describe the business, the
					agitation, the tempest, the University is in about the Margaret Professorship.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2417tm" /> only D:D:s &amp; B:D:s
					have votes,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2418tm" /> so that there are acts upon acts: the bell is eternally tolling<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2419tm" /> as in time of pestilence, &amp; no body knows whose turn it may be next. the Candidates are Dr Law,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2420tm" /> &amp; Z: Brooke<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2421tm" /> &amp; my Ld Sandwich.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2422tm" />
					the day is Saturday next.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2423tm" /> but alas! what is this to the warm region of St John's?<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2424tm" /> it is like Lisbon on the day of the earthquake! it is like the fire of London! I can hear &amp; smell it
					hither. here too appears the furious Zachary,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2425tm" /> but his forces are but three or four men. here towers
					Dr Rutherforth,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2426tm" /> himself an Host, &amp; he has about 3 champions. there Skinner<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2427tm" /> with his powerful oratory, &amp; the decent Mr Alvis,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2428tm" /> with their several
					invisible squadrons. Ogden<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2429tm" /> &amp; Gunning<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2430tm" /> each fighting for himself
					&amp; disdaining the assistance of others. but see, where Frampton<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2431tm" /> rages with his 17 votes, &amp; on
					his buckler glitters the formidable name of Sandwich, at wch Fiends tremble. last of all comes with his mines &amp; counter-mines,
					&amp; old Newcastle at his back, the irresistible force of Powell.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2432tm" /> 23 are a majority, &amp; he has
					already 22 &amp; 1/2. if it lapses to the Seniors, he has it. if it lapses to the Visitor, he has it. in short (as we all believe) he
					has it every way.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2433tm" /> I know you are overjoy'd, especially for that he has the Newcastle interest. I have
					had a very civil visit of two hours from [the]<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2434tm" />
					<hi rend="italic">Archimage,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2435tm" /> busy as he is, for you know, I inherit all y[our]<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2436tm" /> old

				<p>Mr. Gray returns the papers and prints to Mr. Bentham, with many thanks for the sight of them.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2442tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Concludes, he has laid aside his intention of publishing the first four Sections of his Introduction,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2443tm"
					 /> that contain the settlement and progress of Christianity among the Saxons: as (however curious and instructive in themselves) they
					certainly have too slight a connection with the subject in hand to make a part of the present work.</p>
				<p>Has received much entertainment and information from his remarks on the state of Architecture among the Saxons, and thinks he has
					proved his point against the authority of Stow<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2444tm" /> and Somner.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2445tm" /> The
					words of Eddius,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2446tm" /> Richard of Hexham,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2447tm" /> &amp;c., must be every where
					cited in the original tongue, as the most accurate translation is in these cases not to be trusted; this Mr. B. has indeed commonly
					done in the MSS. but not every where.</p>
				<p>P. 31. He says, the instances Sir C. Wren brings were, <hi rend="italic">some of them at least,</hi> undoubtedly erected after the
					Conquest. Sure they were all so without exception.</p>
				<p>There is much probability in what he asserts with respect to the <hi rend="italic">New Norman mode</hi> of building; though this is
					not, nor perhaps can be, made out with so much precision as the former point.</p>
				<p>P. 35. Here, where the Author is giving a compendious view of the peculiarities that distinguish the Saxon style, it might be
					mentioned, that they had no tabernacles (or niches and canopies), nor any statues to adorn their buildings on the outside, which are
					the principal grace of what is called the Gothic; the only exception that I<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2448tm" /> can recollect, is a
					little figure of Bishop Herebert Losing<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2449tm" /> over the north transept door at Norwich, which appears to be
					of that time: but this is rather a mezzorelievo than a statue, and it is well known, that they used reliefs sometimes with profusion,
					as in the Saxon gateway of the abbey at Bury, the gate of the Temple Church at London, and the two gates at Ely, &amp;c.</p>
				<p>The want of pinnacles, and of tracery in the vaults, are afterwards mentioned, but may as well be placed here too (in short), among
					the other characteristicks. </p>
				<p>Escutcheons of arms are hardly (if ever) seen in these fabricks, which are the most frequent of all decorations in after-times. </p>
				<p>P. 34. Beside the Chevron work (or zig-zag moulding) so common, which is here mentioned, there was also, </p>
				<p>The <hi rend="italic">Billeted-moulding,</hi> as if a cylinder should be cut into small pieces of equal length, and these stuck on
					alternately round the face of the arches, as in the choir at Peterborough, and at St. Cross, &amp;c. </p>
				<p>The <hi rend="italic">Nail-head,</hi> resembling the heads of great nails driven in at regular distances, as in the nave of old St.
					Paul's, and the great tower of Hereford, &amp;c.</p>
				<p>The <hi rend="italic">Nebule,</hi> a projection terminated by an undulating line as under the upper range of windows on the outside
					at Peterborough.</p>
				<p>Then to adorn their vast massive columns there was the <hi rend="italic">Spiral-Groove</hi> winding round the shafts, and the <hi
						rend="italic">Net,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lozenge-work,</hi> overspreading them; both of which appear at Durham, and the first in
					the undercroft at Canterbury.</p>
				<p>These few things are mentioned only, because Mr. Bentham's work is so nearly compleat in this part, that one would wish it were quite
					so. His own observation may doubtless suggest to him many more peculiarities, which, however minute in appearance, are not
					contemptible, because they directly belong to his subject, and contribute to ascertain the age of an edifice at first sight. The great
					deficiency is from Henry VIth's time to the Reformation, when the art was indeed at its height. </p>
				<p>P. 36. At York, under the choir, remains much of the old work, built by Archbishop Roger,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2450tm" /> of
					Bishop's-bridge, in Henry IId's reign; the arches are but just pointed, and rise on short round pillars, whose capitals are adorned
					with animals and foliage.</p>
				<p>P. 37. Possibly the pointed arch might take its rise from those arcades we see in the early Norman (or Saxon) buildings on walls,
					where the wide semicircular arches cross and intersect each other, and form thereby at their intersection exactly a narrow and
					sharp-pointed arch. In the wall south of the choir at St. Cross, is a facing of such wide, round, interlaced arches by way of ornament
					to a flat vacant space; only so much of it as lies between the legs of the two neighbouring arches, where they cross each other, is
					pierced through the fabrick, and forms a little range of long pointed windows. It is of King Stephen's time. </p>
				<p>P. 43. As Mr. B. has thought it proper to make a compliment to the <hi rend="italic">present set of Governors</hi> in their
					respective churches; it were to be wished he would insert a little reflection on the rage of repairing, beautifying, whitewashing,
					painting, and gilding, and (above all) the mixture of Greek (or Roman) ornaments in Gothic edifices. This well-meant fury has been and
					will be little less fatal to our ancient magnificent edifices, than the reformation and the civil wars. </p>
				<p>Mr. G. would wish to be told (at Mr. Bentham's leisure), whether over the great pointed arches, on which the Western Tower at Ely
					rises, any thing like a semicircular curve appears in the stone work? and whether the screen (or rood-loft) with some part of the
					South-Cross, may not possibly be a part of the more ancient church built by Abbot Simeon<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2451tm" /> and
						Fitz-Gilbert?<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2452tm" />

				<p> </p>
				<p>My instructions, of which you are so desirous, are two-fold: the first part relates to what is past,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2455tm"
					 /> and that will be rather diffuse: the second, to what is to come; and that we shall treat more succinctly, and with all due
					brevity.</p>
				<p>First, when you come to Paris you will not fail to visit the cloister of the Chartreuse, where Le Sueur<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2456tm" /> (in the history of St. Bruno) has almost equalled Raphael. Then your Gothic inclinations will naturally
					lead you to the Sainte Chapelle built by St. Louis: in the treasury is preserved one of the noblest gems of the Augustan age. When you
					take a trip into the country, there is a fine old chapel at Vincennes with admirable painted windows; and at Fontainbleau, the remains
					of Francis the First's magnificence might give you some pleasure. In your way to Lyons you will take notice of the view over the Saone,
					from about Tournus and Macon. Fail not to walk a few miles along the banks of the Rhone, down the river. I would certainly make a
					little journey to the Grande Chartreuse,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2457tm" /> up the mountains: at your return out of Italy this will have
					little effect. At Turin you will visit the Capuchins' convent just without the city, and the Superga at no great distance, for the sake
					of the views. At Genoa observe the Terreno of the Palace Brignoli, as a model of an apartment elegantly disposed in a hot climate. At
					Parma you will adore the great Madonna and St. Jerom, once at St. Antonio Abbate, but now (I am told) in the Ducal Palace. In the
					Madonna della Steccata observe the Moses breaking the tables, a chiaroscuro figure of the Parmeggiano<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2458tm" />
					at too great a height, and ill lighted, but immense. At the Capuchins, the great Pietá of Annib. Caracci;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2459tm" /> in the Villa Ducale, the room painted by Carlo Cignani;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2460tm" /> and the last
					works of Agostino Caracci<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2461tm" /> at Modena.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2462tm" /> I know not what remains now,
					the flower of the collection is gone to Dresden. Bologna is too vast a subject for me to treat: the palaces and churches are open; you
					have nothing to do but to see them all. In coming down the Apennine you will see (if the sun shines) all Tuscany before you. And so I
					have brought you to Florence, where to be sure there is nothing worth seeing.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2463tm" /> Secondly, <list>
						<item>1. Vide, quodcunque videndum est. </item>
						<item>2. Quodcunque ego non vidi, id tu vide. </item>
						<item>3. Quodcunque videris, scribe &amp; describe; memoriæ ne fide.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2464tm" />

						<item>5. Tritum viatorum compitum<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2465tm" /> calca, &amp; cum poteris, desere.</item>
						<item>6. Eme, quodcunque emendum est; I do not mean pictures, medals, gems, drawings, &amp;c., only; but clothes, stockings, shoes,
							handkerchiefs, little moveables; every thing you may want all your life long: but have a care of the custom house. </item>
					</list>
				</p>
				<p>Pray present my most respectful compliments to Mr. Weddell.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2466tm" /> I conclude when the winter is over, and
					you have seen Rome and Naples, you will strike out of the beaten path of English travellers, and see a little of the country, throw
					yourselves into the bosom of the Appennine, survey the horrid lake of Amsanctus<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2467tm" /> (look in
						Cluver's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2468tm" /> Italy), catch the breezes on the coast of Taranto and Salerno, expatiate to the very toe of
					the continent, perhaps strike over the Faro of Messina, and having measured the gigantic columns of Girgenti, and the tremendous
					caverns of Syracusa, refresh yourselves amidst the fragrant vale of Enna. Oh! che bel riposo!</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor</salute>
				</opener>
				<p> I have lately heard, that you have been very ill, &amp; that in the midst of your illness your poor Sister Ettrick<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2481tm" /> was obliged to fly from her Persecutor, &amp; put herself under your protection. pray inform me, as soon as
					you can, of the state of your health in the first place, &amp; next, how you have been able to secure a poor frighted Woman from the
					brutality of such a husband, wch under our excellent constitution (I take it) is rather a more difficult thing, than it would be in
						Turkey.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2482tm" />
				</p>
				<p>For me, I passed the latter part of the last autumn at Southampton<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2483tm" /> all alone (for I went to no
						rooms,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2484tm" /> nor saw any company, as they call it) in a most beautiful country, &amp; very gentle climate.
					the air &amp; the walks agreed with me wonderfully. the sea-water I scarce tried (as the winter approached) enough to say, whether it
					would suit me, or not. some time after I return'd hither, came the gout in both feet successively, very gentle as to pain, but it left
					a weakness &amp; sense of lassitude behind it, that even yet is not wholly dissipated. I have a great propensity to Hartlepool this
					summer, it is in your neighbourhood, &amp; that is to make up for climate &amp; for trees. the sea, the turf, &amp; the rocks, I
					remember, have merit enough of their own. Mr Brown is so invincibly attach'd to his duties of Treasurer &amp; Tutor, &amp; I know not
					what, that I give up all hopes of bringing him with me: nor do I (till I have been at London) speak determinately as to myself: perhaps
					I may find good reasons (against my inclination) to change my mind. </p>
				<p>Your Mother, the University, has succeeded in her great cause against the Secretary of State.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2485tm" /> Ld
					Hardwick is declared duely elected by a Majority of one voice. all the Judges of the King's-bench took occasion to declare their
					opinion in set speeches on the question; I suppose, in order to gain a little popularity, for whatever seems against Ld S:, must be
					popular. Ld Mansfield was express on two points, that the Universities were not subject to any Royal Visitations, but might always
					apply to &amp; receive redress from his Maj:s Courts of Justice; &amp; that they were bound by no statutes, but such as they themselves
					had thought fit to receive. these things are doubtless of far more consequence to them than the cause in question, for wch I am the
					less concern'd, because I do believe the two Pretenders had (privately) agreed the matter beforehand,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2486tm" />
					for the House of Yorke have undoubtedly been long making up to the Court. I should tell you, that Dr. Long's<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2487tm" /> Affidavit was only begun to be read, &amp; laid aside as of no consequence. I suppose you know by this
					time, that our Friend the B: of Ch:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2488tm" /> was the private Embassador of Ld S: to this place, &amp; made
					proposals in his name. he also was present on the side of that worthy Nobleman at the remarkable interview with Mr Charles
						Yorke.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2489tm" /> it is certain he refused the Archb:k of Armagh;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2490tm" /> but why, I
					can not yet learn: some say, because they intended to quarter so many pensions upon it: others, because they would keep to themselves
					the disposal of all the preferments. but neither of these seem to be sufficient reasons. it is sure, he wrote circular letters to his
					friends to acquaint them of this refusal, &amp; that he was snub'd for doing so. whereas Bp Newton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2491tm" />
					to whom it was first offer'd, made a great secret of it, as a good Courtier should do. now I am talking of Bishops, I must tell you,
					that not long ago B:P Warburton in a sermon at Court asserted, that all preferments were bestow'd on the most illiterate &amp;
					worthless objects, &amp; in speaking turn'd himself about &amp; stared directly at the Bp. of London.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2492tm" />
					he added, that if any one arose distinguish'd for merit &amp; learning, there was a combination of dunces to keep him down. I need not
					tell you, that he expected the Bk of London himself, when Terrick got it.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2493tm" /> so ends my ecclesiastical
					history.</p>
				<p>Our friend, the Precentor, who has so long been in a <hi rend="italic">mariturient</hi> way, is not yet married,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2494tm" /> &amp; I doubt, it is all gone off. I dare not ask about it, but if I goe northward, shall take him in my
					way, &amp; see, whether he will tell me. present my best compliments to Mrs. Wharton, &amp; Miss.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2495tm" /> I
					have no idea of the family at present, &amp; expect to see a multitude of little new faces, that know not Joseph.</p>

				<p> I can not help writing a line, whereas you have reason to expect a volume, wch indeed could not contain the history of this
					wonderful period. we are at the eve, I fear, of some great event, &amp; perhaps a very tragical one. the bill of regency<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2506tm" /> brought in by the ministry against their own will, afterwards turn'd by them to serve their own purpose,
					&amp; that purpose afterwards drop'd &amp; aukwardly disavowed by them, are things, that you must have heard already in gross, &amp;
					the detail I have not time to give you. I shall only tell you, that yesterday the D: of C:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2507tm" /> was sent
					in the morning to Hayes<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2508tm" /> at eleven, &amp; did not come back till past four. when you know he undertook
					the embassy, you will imagine, what the terms were. he carried a Carte Blanche with him, honours, offices, absolute &amp; unlimited
					power. all wch (to the astonishment of all mankind) were sent back as they came, with a peremptory refusal. whether from resentment of
					their former craft &amp; little unworthy dealings with him, or that he may be press'd &amp; intreated in a more <hi rend="italic"
						>submissive</hi> manner to accept the uncontroll'd guidance of the nation, is hard to say. I hope the latter, for then he will yield,
					&amp; if he does not, God knows what may be the consequence. Bedford House<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2509tm" /> is like a fortress
						besieged.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2510tm" /> soldiers looking over the walls, &amp; patrolling round all the avenues. he immured
					within, &amp; the Dutchess<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2511tm" /> ill with fright. the mob curseing him without &amp; his garrison murmuring
					at the service they are forced to do within. at the time of the great disturbance the Ministers were all there in the house, &amp; had
					not risen from table. had it not been for the Guards, the house had certainly been pull'd down, &amp; all the family murther'd. they
					say, there were few or no weavers among the mob, but in these times of scarcity &amp; general discontent, it is no wonder, if all the
						villainous<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2512tm" /> populace of London should join them. I saw the Weavers at the door of the house of Lords
					on Thursday.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2513tm" /> as far as my eye can judge, I do not believe, they were 5000, &amp; they neither
					appear'd insolent, nor intimidated. the noise was great, &amp; I assure you, there were many blank faces in fine coaches to be seen,
					&amp; much bowing &amp; smiling, &amp; civil words thrown at random among the ragged regiment. tomorrow is the day, when worse is
					expected, &amp; it is certain numbers are flocking to Town from Norfolk, Essex, &amp;c: the London Militia are order'd out, &amp; no
					one can say, where this may end. if Mr P:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2514tm" /> accepts, all this may vanish into smoke.</p>

				<p> It is true, I have been lately a very indifferent Correspondent, but Poverty knows no law, &amp; must be my excuse. since the
					fortnight I pass'd with Mason at York (who was then very bad with that troublesome defluxion in his eyes, and is since cured &amp; now
					stands on the brink of marriage),<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2563tm" /> I have been always resident at Old Park, excursions excepted of a
					day or two at a time, and one lately of three weeks to Hartlepool.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2564tm" /> the rocks, the sea, &amp; the
					weather there, more than made up to me the want of bread &amp; the want of water, two capital defects, but of wch I learn'd from the
					inhabitants not to be sensible. they live on the refuse of their own fish-market, with a few potatoes, &amp; a reasonable quantity of
					Geneva, six days in the week, &amp; I have nowhere seen a taller, more robust, or healthy race. every house full of ruddy broad-faced
					children. nobody dies but of drowning or old age. nobody poor but from drunkenness, or mere laziness. I had long wish'd for a storm,
					and was treated before I came away with such a one as July could produce: but the waves did not rise above twelve foot high, &amp;
					there was no hurt done. on Monday (I believe) I go to Scotland with my Lord, and Tom,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2565tm" /> &amp; the

				<p> If I thought it necessary to offer an apology for venturing to address you in this abrupt manner, I should be very much at a loss
					how to begin. I might plead my admiration of your genius, and my attachment to your character; but who is he, that could not, with
					truth, urge the same excuse for intruding on your retirement? I might plead my earnest desire to be personally acquainted with a man
					whom I have so long and so passionately admired in his writings; but thousands, of greater consequence than I, are ambitious of the
					same honour. I, indeed, must either flatter myself that no apology is necessary, or otherwise, I must despair of obtaining what has
					long been the object of my most ardent wishes; I must for ever forfeit all hopes of seeing you, and conversing with you.</p>
				<p> It was yesterday I received the agreeable news of your being in Scotland, and of your intending to visit some parts of it. Will you
					permit us to hope, that we shall have an opportunity, at Aberdeen, of thanking you in person, for the honour you have done to Britain,
					and to the poetic art, by your inestimable compositions, and of offering you all that we have that deserves your acceptance, namely,
					hearts full of esteem, respect, and affection? If you cannot come so far northward, let me at least be acquainted with the place of
					your residence, and permitted to wait on you. Forgive, sir, this request; forgive me if I urge it with earnestness, for indeed it
					concerns me nearly;</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I defer'd writing to you, till I had seen a little more of this countrey, than you yourself had seen, &amp; now being just return'd
					from an excursion, wch I &amp; the Major<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2585tm" /> have been making, into the High-lands, I sit down to tell
					you all about it: but first I must return to my journey hither, on wch I shall be very short, partly because you know the way as far as
					Edinburgh, &amp; partly, that there was not a great deal worth remarking. the first night<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2586tm" /> we pass'd
					at Tweedmouth (77 miles) the next at Edinburgh (53 M:) where Ld S:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2587tm" /> left the Major and me, to go to
						<hi rend="italic">Lenox-love</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2588tm" /> (Ld Blantyre's)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2589tm" /> where his Aunt<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2590tm" />
					lives. so that afternoon &amp; all next day I had leisure to visit the Castle, Holy-Rood-House, Heriot's Hospital, Arthur's-seat,
					&amp;c: &amp; am not sorry to have seen that most picturesque (at a distance) &amp; nastiest (when near) of all capital Cities. I sup'd
					with Dr Robertson<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2591tm" /> and other Literati,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2592tm" /> &amp; the next morning Ld S:
					came for us. we cross'd at the Queen's Ferry in a four-oar'd yawl without a sail, &amp; were toss'd about rather more than I should
					wish to hazard again. lay at Perth, a large <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> Town with much wood about it on the banks of the Tay, a very
					noble river. next morning ferried over it, &amp; came by dinner time to Glamis, being (from Edinburgh) 67 miles, wch makes in all from
					Hetton 197 M:. the Castle stands in Strathmore (i:e: the Great Vally) wch winds about from Stonehaven on the East-Coast of
					Kincairdinshire obliquely as far as Stirling near 100 miles in length, &amp; from 7 to 10 miles in breadth, cultivated every where to
					the foot of the Hills on either hand with oats or bere-barley, except where the soil is mere peat-earth (black as a coal) or barren
					sand cover'd only with broom &amp; heath, or a short grass fit for sheep. here &amp; there appear just above ground the huts of the
					inhabitants, wch they call Towns, built of &amp; cover'd with turf, &amp; among them at great distances the Gentlemen's houses with
					inclosures &amp; a few trees round them. amidst these our Castle distinguishes itself, the middle part of it rising proudly out of what
					seems a great &amp; thick wood of tall trees with a cluster of hanging towers on the top. you descend to it gradually from the South
					thro' a double &amp; triple avenue of Scotch Firs 60 or 70 feet high under three Gateways. this approach is a full mile long, &amp;
					when you have pass'd the 2d Gate, the Firs change to Limes, &amp; another oblique avenue goes off on either hand toward the Offices.
					these as well as all the enclosures, that surround the house, are border'd with 3 or 4 ranks of sycomores, ashes, &amp; white poplars
					of the noblest height &amp; from 70 to 100 years old. other allies there are that go off at right angles with the long one, small
					groves &amp; wall'd gardens of Earl Patrick's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2593tm" /> planting, full of broad-leaved elms, oaks, birch,
					black-cherry-trees, Laburnums, &amp;c: all of great stature &amp; size, wch have not till this week begun to shew the least sense of
					morning frosts. the 3d Gate delivers you into a Court with a broad pavement, &amp; grass-plats adorn'd with statues of the four Stuart
						Kings,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2594tm" /> border'd with old silver-firs &amp; yew-trees alternately, &amp; opening with an iron
					palissade on either side to two square old-fashion'd parterres surrounded by stone-fruit-walls. the house from the height of it, the
					greatness of its mass, the many towers atop, &amp; the spread of its wings, has really a very singular &amp; striking appearance, like
					nothing I ever saw. you will comprehend something of its shape from the plan of the 2d floor, wch I inclose.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2595tm" /> the wings are about 50 feet high, the body (wch is the old-castle with walls 10 feet thick) is near 100.
					from the leads I see to the South of me (just at the end of the avenue), the little Town of Glames, the houses built of stone &amp;
					slated, with a neat Kirk &amp; small square Tower (a rarity in this region) just beyond it rises a beautiful round hill, &amp; another
					ridge of a longer form adjacent to it, both covered with woods of tall fir: beyond them peep over the black hills of <hi rend="italic"
						>Sid-law,</hi> over which winds the road to Dundee. to the North within about 7 miles of me begin to rise the Grampions, hill above
					hill, on whose tops 3 weeks ago I could plainly see some traces of the snow, that fell in May last. to the East winds away the <hi
						rend="italic">Strath,</hi> such as I have before described it, among the hills, wch sink lower &amp; lower, as they approach the sea.
					to the West the same valley (not plain, but broken unequal ground) runs on for above 20 miles in view: there I see the crags above
					Dunkeld, there <hi rend="italic">Beni-Gloe,</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Beni-More</hi> rise above the clouds, &amp; there is that <hi
						rend="italic">She-khallian,</hi> that spires into a cone above them all, &amp; lies at least 45 miles (in a direct line) from this
					place. Ld S:, who is the greatest Farmer in this neighbourhood, is from break of day to dark night among his husbandmen &amp;
					labourers; he has near 2000 acres of land in his own hands, &amp; is at present employ'd in building a low wall of 4 miles long; &amp;
					in widening the bed of the little river <hi rend="italic">Deane,</hi> which runs to S: &amp; S:E: of the house, from about 20 to 50
					feet wide, both to prevent inundations, &amp; to drain the Lake of Forfar. this work will be 2 years more in compleating; &amp; must be
					3 miles in length. all the Highlanders, that can be got, are employ'd in it; many of them know no English, &amp; I hear them singing
					Erse-songs all day long. the price of labour is 8 pence a-day; but to such, as will join together &amp; engage to perform a certain
					portion in a limited time, 2 shillings. I must say, that all our labours seem to prosper, &amp; my Ld has casually found in digging
					such quantities of shell-marle, as not only fertilize his own grounds, but are disposed of at a good price to all his neighbours. in
					his nurseries are thousands of oaks, beech, larches, horse-chesnuts, spruce-fir, &amp;c: thick as they can stand, &amp; whose only
					fault is, that they are grown tall &amp; vigorous, before he has determined, where to plant them out. the most advantageous spot we
					have for beauty lies West of the House, where (when the stone-walls of the meadows are taken away) the grounds (naturally unequal) will
					have a very park-like appearance. they are already full of trees, wch need only thinning here &amp; there to break the regularity of
					their lines, &amp; thro' them winds the <hi rend="italic">Burn of Glames,</hi> a clear &amp; rapid trout-stream, wch joins the R: Deane
					hard by. pursuing the course of this brook upwards, you come to a narrow sequester'd valley shelter'd from all winds, through wch it
					runs murmuring among great stones; on one hand the ground gently rises into a hill, on the other are the rocky banks of the rivulet
					almost perpendicular, yet cover'd with sycamore, ash, &amp; fir, that (tho' it seems to have no place or soil to grow in) yet has risen
					to a good height, &amp; forms a thick shade. you may continue along this gill &amp; passing by one end of the village &amp; its church
					for half a mile it leads to an opening between the two hills cover'd with fir-woods, that I mention'd above, thro' wch the stream makes
					its way, &amp; forms a cascade of 10 or 12 feet over broken rocks. a very little art is necessary to make all this a beautiful scene.
					the weather till the last week has been in general very fine &amp; warm: we have had no fires till now, &amp; often have sate with the
					windows open an hour after sunset. now &amp; then a shower has come, &amp; sometimes sudden gusts of wind descend from the mountains
					that finish as suddenly as they arose: but today it blows a hurricane. upon the whole I have been exceeding lucky in my weather, &amp;
					particularly in my highland expedition of five days. </p>
				<p>We set out then the 11th of Sept: &amp; continuing along the Strath to the West pass'd through <hi rend="italic">Megill,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2596tm" /> where is the tomb of <hi rend="italic">Queen Wanders, that was riven to dethe by staned-horses for
						nae gude, that she did.</hi> so the Women there told me, I'm sure. thro' Cowper of Angus;<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2597tm" /> over the
					River Ila, then over a wide &amp; dismal heath fit for an assembly of Witches, till we came to a string of four small lakes in a
					valley, whose deep-blew waters &amp; green margin, with a Gentleman's house or two seated on them in little groves, contrasted with the
					black desert, in wch they were inchased. the ground now grew unequal, the hills more rocky seem'd to close in upon us, till the road
					came to the brow of a steep descent, &amp; (the sun then setting) between two woods of oak we saw far below us the River Tay come
					sweeping along at the bottom of a precipice at least 150 feet deep, clear as glass, full to the brim, &amp; very rapid in its course.
					it seem'd to issue out of woods thick &amp; tall, that rose on either hand, &amp; were overhung by broken rocky crags of vast height:
					above them to the West the tops of higher mountains appear'd, on wch the evening clouds reposed. down by the side of the river under
					the thickest shades is seated the Town of Dunkeld: in the midst of it stands a ruin'd Cathedral, the towers &amp; shell of the building
					still entire. a little beyond it a large house of the Duke of Athol with its offices &amp; gardens extends a mile beyond the town,
					&amp; as his grounds were interrupted by the streets &amp; roads he has flung arches of communication across them, that add to the
					scenery of the place, wch of itself is built of good white stone, &amp; handsomely slated, so that no one would take it for a Scotch
					Town till they come into it. here we pass'd the night: if I told you how, you would bless yourself. next day we set forward to Taymouth
					27 miles farther West, the road winding thro' beautiful woods with the Tay almost always in full view to the right, being here from 3
					to 400 feet over. The Strath-Tay from a mile to 3 miles or more wide, cover'd with corn &amp; spotted with groups of people then in the
					midst of their harvest. on either hand a vast chain of rocky mountains, that changed their face &amp; open'd something new every
					hundred yards, as the way turn'd, or the clouds pass'd: in short altogether it was one of the most pleasing days I have pass'd these
					many years, &amp; at every step I wish'd for you. at the close of day we came to <hi rend="italic">Balloch.</hi> so the place was
					call'd: but now for decency <hi rend="italic">Taymouth,</hi> improperly enough, for here it is, that the river issues out of Loch-Tay
					(a glorious lake (15 miles long &amp; 11/2 broad) surrounded with prodigious mountains. there on its N: Eastern brink impending o'er it
					is the vast hill of Lawers:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2598tm" /> to the East is that monstrous creature of God, <hi rend="italic"
						>Shekhallian</hi> (i:e: the Maiden's Pap) spiring above the clouds. directly West (beyond the end of the Lake) <hi rend="italic"
						>Beni-More</hi> (the Great Mountain) rises to a most aweful height, &amp; looks down on the tomb of Fingal.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2599tm" /> Ld Braidalbin's <hi rend="italic">policy</hi> (so they call here all such ground as is laid out for
					pleasure) takes in about 2000 acres, of wch his house, offices, &amp; a deer-park about 3 miles round occupy the plain or bottom, wch
					is little above a mile in breadth. thro' it winds the Tay, wch by means of a bridge I found here to be 156 feet over. his plantations
					&amp; woods rise with the ground on either side the vale to the very summit of the enormous crags, that overhang it. along them on the
					mountain's side runs a terrass a mile &amp; 1/2 long, that overlooks the course of the river. from several seats &amp; temples perch'd
					on particular rocky eminences you command the Lake for many miles in length, wch turns like some huge river, &amp; loses itself among
					the mountains, that surround it. at its eastern extremity, where the river issues out of it, on a peninsula my Ld has built a neat
					little town &amp; church with a high square tower, &amp; just before it lies a small round island in the lake cover'd with trees,
					amongst wch are the ruins of some little religious house. trees (by the way) grow here to great size &amp; beauty. I saw four old
					chestnuts in the road, as you enter the park, of vast bulk &amp; height. one beech-tree I measured, that was 16 feet, 7 inches in the
					girth, &amp; (I guess) near 80 feet in height. The Gardiner presented us with peaches, nectarines, &amp; plums from the stonewalls of
					the kitchen-garden (for there are no brick nor hot walls) the peaches were good, the rest well-tasted, but scarce ripe. we had also
					golden-pippens from an espalier (not ripe) &amp; a melon very well flavour'd &amp; fit to cut. of the house I have little to say: it is
					a very good Nobleman's house handsomely furnish'd &amp; well-kept, very comfortable to inhabit, but not worth going far to see. of the
					Earl's taste I have not much more to say. it is one of those noble situations, that Man can not spoil: it is however certain, that he
					has built an inn &amp; a town just where his principal walks should have been, &amp; in the most wonderful spot of ground, that perhaps
					belongs to him. in this inn however we lay, &amp; next day returning down the river 4 miles we pass'd it over a fine bridge built at
					the expence of the Government, &amp; continued our way to <hi rend="italic">Logie-Rait</hi> just below wch in a most charming scene the
						<hi rend="italic">Tummel,</hi> wch is here the larger river of the two, falls into the Tay. we ferried over the Tummel in order to get
					into Marshal Wade's road<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2600tm" /> (wch leads from Dunkeld to Inverness) &amp; continued our way along it
					toward the North. the road is excellent, but dangerous enough in conscience. the river often running directly under us at the bottom of
					a precipice 200 feet deep, sometimes masqued indeed by wood, that finds means to grow where I could not stand: but very often quite
					naked &amp; without any defence. in such places we walked for miles together partly for fear, &amp; partly to admire the beauty of the
					country, wch the beauty of the weather set off to the greatest advantage. as evening came on, we approach'd the Pass of Gillikrankie,
					where in the year 45 the Hessians with their Prince at their head stop'd short, &amp; refused to march a foot farther.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2601tm" />
					<hi rend="italic">Vestibulum ante ipsum</hi>, primis<anchor xml:id="tg2a.2601tm" />qbi in faucibus Orci<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2602tm"
					 /> stands the solitary mansion of Mr Robinson of Fascley.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2603tm" /> close by it rises a hill cover'd with oak,
					with grotesque masses of rock staring from among their trunks, like the sullen countenances of Fingal &amp; all his family frowning on
					the little mortals of modern days. from between this hill and the adjacent mountains pent in a narrow channel comes roaring out the
					river Tummel, &amp; falls headlong down involved in white foam wch rises into a mist all round it &#x2014;&#x2014; but my paper is
					deficient, &amp; I must say nothing of the Pass itself, the black river Garry, the Blair of Athol, Mount Beni-Gloe, my return (by
					another road) to Dunkeld, the Hermitage, the <hi rend="italic">Stra-Brann,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2604tm" /> &amp; the Rumbling-Brigg. in short since I saw the Alps, I have seen nothing sublime till now. in
					about a week<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2605tm" /> I shall set forward by the Stirling-road on my return all alone. pray for me, till I see
					you, for I dread Edinburgh &amp; the itch, and expect to find very little in my way worth the perils I am to endure.<anchor

				<p>I must beg you would present my most grateful acknowledgements to your learned Society for the publick mark of their esteem, which

					&amp; (I may say) happy hours of my life: yet shall ever retain in my memory the obligations You have laid me under, &amp; be proud of
					my connection with the University of Aberdeen.</p>
				<p>It is a pleasure to me to find, that you are not offended with the liberties I took, when you were at Glames.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2611tm" /> you took me too literally, if you thought I meant in the least to discourage you in your pursuit of Poetry.
					all I intended to say was, that if either Vanity (that is, a general &amp; undistinguishing desire of applause) or Interest, or
					Ambition has any place in the breast of a poet, he stands a great chance in these our days of being severely disappointed: and yet
					after all these passions are suppress'd, there may remain in the mind of one, <hi rend="italic">ingenti perculsus amore</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2612tm" /> (and such a one I take you to be), incitements of a better sort strong enough to make him write

				<p>I am sorry for the trouble you have had to gratify my curiosity &amp; love of superstition,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2613tm" /> yet I
					heartily thank you. on Monday,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2614tm" /> Sr, I set forward on my way to England, where if I can be of any

				<p>I am at last return'd to my old Squirrel's nest from the Highlands, wch would be Italy, if they had but a climate, &amp; even that

				<p>The night after I arrived, the D: of Cumberland died.<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2624tm" /> the preceding night he pass'd at Windsor,
					&amp; meant to be at Court in the morning, but overslept himself &amp; came too late to Town. between 7 &amp; 8 he found his usual

				<p>Res est sacra <hi rend="italic">miser</hi> (says the Poet)<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2634tm" /> but I say, it is the happy Man, that is
					the sacred thing; &amp; therefore let the Profane keep their distance: he is one of Lucretius' Gods, supremely blest in the
					contemplation of his own felicity, &amp; what has he to do with Worshippers? this (mind) is the first reason, why I did not come to
					York. the second is, that I do not love confinement, &amp; probably by next summer may be permitted to <hi rend="italic">touch</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2635tm" /> whom &amp; where &amp; with what I think fit without giving you any offence. the third &amp; last,
					&amp; not the least perhaps, is, that the finances were at so low an ebb, that I could not exactly do what I wish'd, but was obliged to
					come the shortest road to Town &amp; recruit them. I do not justly know what your taste in reasons may be, since you alter'd your
					condition; but there is the ingenious, the petulant, &amp; the dull, for you. any one would have done, for in my conscience I do not
					believe you care a half-penny for reasons at present. so God bless ye both, &amp; give ye all ye wish, when ye are restored to the use
					of your wishes! </p>
				<p>I am return'd from Scotland charm'd with my expedition: it is of the Highlands I speak: the Lowlands are worth seeing once, but the
					Mountains are extatic, &amp; ought to be visited in pilgrimage once a year. none but those monstrous creatures of God know how to join
					so much beauty with so much horror. a fig for your Poets, Painters, Gardiners, &amp; Clergymen,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2636tm" /> that
					have not been among them: their imagination can be made up of nothing but bowling-greens, flowering shrubs, horse-ponds, Fleet-ditches,
					shell-grottoes, &amp; Chinée-rails. then I had so beautiful an autumn: Italy could hardly produce a nobler scene, or a finer season.
					and this so sweetly contrasted with that perfection of nastiness, &amp; total want of accommodation, that Scotland only can supply. oh!
					you would have bless'd yourself. I shall certainly go again. what a pity 'tis I can't draw, nor describe, nor ride on horseback!<anchor

					changes in your diet, I do not say in quantity, but in quality. that when you are recovering &amp; the pain is gone, but has left
					behind it a weakness in the joint, you will not be too indulgent to that weakness: but give yourself so much of motion &amp; exercise,
					as you can well endure. above all, keep your legs warmer at all times, whether you are well or ill, in bed or up, than you have
					commonly used to do, &amp; as far as may be, always in the same temperature. the quantity of wine you have commonly used has been so
					inconsiderable, that I do not believe it ever did, or will hurt you: but if you leave it off, mix a little quantity of spirit, brandy
					or whatever else is palatable to you, with your water. remember, it is only the wine-drinking nations, that know what the gout is:
					whereas those, that even indulge themselves in distill'd liquours, as well the laborious &amp; hard-faring people, as the indolent
					&amp; luxurious, tho' subject to many other disorders, are utter strangers to this. my prescriptions are simple, but they are such as I

				<p>You are very kind to inquire so particularly after my gout: I wish I may not be too circumstantial in my answer; but you have tapped
					a dangerous topic; I can talk gout by the hour. It is my great mortification, &amp; has disappointed all the hopes that I had built on
					temperance &amp; hardiness. I have resisted like a hermit, &amp; exposed myself to all weathers &amp; seasons like a smugler; and in
					vain. I have however still so much of the obstinacy of both professions left, that I think I shall continue, &amp; cannot obey you in
					keeping myself warm. I have gone thro my second fit under one blanket, &amp; already go about in a silk wastecoat with my bosom
					unbuttoned. In short, I am as prejudiced to my regimen, tho so ineffectual, as I coud have been to all I expected from it. The truth
					is, I am almost as willing to have the gout as to be liable to catch cold; &amp; must run up stairs &amp; down, in &amp; out of doors
					when I will, or I cannot have the least satisfaction. This will convince you how readily I comply with another of your precepts,
					walking as soon as I am able &#x2013; I have had little indulgence for myself on that head. Wine I drink with my water, because I
					cannot drink the filthy water here by itself; I began with brandy, but soon grew to nauseate it. The greatest change I have made, is in
					leaving off Tea &#x2013; I doubt, only because I took an aversion to it. I own I am much better since. This is the Detail: the general
					history is, that I was seized with the gout in one foot at the End of June, soon had it in both, with great torment, &amp; then without
					it's going out of my feet, in head, Stomach, both wrists &amp; both Shoulders. Nine weeks passed before I coud even walk without a
					Stick; yet the state of Convalescence, as it has been in my second fit, was much worse &amp; more uneasy than the heigth of the pain,
					from the constant sickness at my Stomach. I came hither, mended miraculously with the Sea &amp; the journey, but caught cold in a
					fortnight, &amp; have had six weeks more of pain in both feet, and such sickness that I have been very near starved: besides such
					swelled legs, that they were as much too big for my body, as before they woud have been too little for any other person's alive. I have
					now got the better of every thing but the weakness, &amp; am only thrown or tumble down ten times a day. For receipts, you may trust me
					for making use of none; I woud not see a physician at the worst, but have quacked myself as boldly, as Quacks treat others. I laughed
					at your idea of quality receipts,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2656tm" /> it came so apropos: there is not a Man or Woman here that is not a
					perfect old Nurse, &amp; who does not talk gruel &amp; anatomy with equal fluency &amp; ignorance. one instance shall serve; Madame de
					Bouzols, Marshal Berwick's daughter,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2657tm" /> assured me there was nothing so good for the gout as to preserve
					the parings of my nails in a bottle close-stopped. When I try any illustrious Nostrum, I shall give the preference to this.</p>
				<p>So much for the Gout! I told you what was coming. As to the Ministry, I know &amp; care very little about them. I told you &amp; told
					them long ago, that if ever a change happened, I woud bid adieu to Politics for ever. Do me the justice to allow that I have not
					altered with the Times. I was so impatient to put this resolution in execution, that I hurried out of England, before I was
					sufficiently recovered. I shall not run the same hazard again in haste; but will stay here till I am perfectly well, &amp; the Season
					of warm weather coming on or arrived, tho the Charms of Paris have not the least attraction for me, nor woud keep me here an hour on
					their own account. For the City itself, I cannot conceive where my eyes were: It is the ugliest, beastly Town in the Universe. I have
					not seen a mouthfull of verdure out of it, nor have they any thing green but their treillage &amp; window shutters. Trees cut into
					fireshovels &amp; stuck into pedestals of chalk, compose their country. Their boasted knowledge of Society is reduced to talking of
					their suppers, &amp; every malady they have about them, or know of. The Dauphin<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2658tm" /> is at the point of
					death; every morning the Physicians frame an account of him, &amp; happy is he or She who can produce a copy of this lie, called a <hi
						rend="italic">bulletin.</hi> The night before last, one of these was produced at supper where I was; it was read, &amp; said, he had
					had <hi rend="italic">une evacuation fœtide</hi> &#x2013; I beg your pardon, tho you are not at Supper. The old Lady of the

					for a fortnight, &amp; is very agreable, called out, oh! they have forgot to mention that he threw down his chamberpot, and was forced
					to change his bed. There were present several Women of the first rank, as Madame de la Valiere, who you remember Duchesse de
						Vaujour,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2661tm" /> &amp; who is still miraculously pretty tho fiftythree, a very handsome Madame de
						Forcalquier,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2662tm" /> &amp; others &#x2013; nor was this conversation at all particular to that evening. They
					talk of a <hi rend="italic">Chienne chaude,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">dangerous</hi> time of a Woman's age, as they woud talk of a
					knotting bag.</p>
				<p>Their gaiety is not greater than their Delicacy &#x2013; but I will not expatiate. In short, they are another people from what They
					were. They may be growing wise, but the intermediate passage is Dullness. Several of the Women are agreable, &amp; some of the Men; but
					the Latter are in general vain &amp; ignorant. The Scavants, I beg their pardons, the Philosophes, are insupportable. Superficial,
					overbearing, &amp; fanatic; they preach incessantly, &amp; their avowed doctrine is Atheism; you woud not believe how openly &#x2013;
					Dont wonder therefore, if I should return a Jesuit. Voltaire himself does not satisfy them: One of their Lady-Devotes said of Him; il
					est Bigot; c'est un Deiste. </p>
				<p>I am as little pleased with their taste in trifles. Crebillon<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2663tm" /> is entirely out of fashion, &amp;
						Marivaux<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2664tm" /> a proverb; <hi rend="italic">Marivauder,</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Marivaudage</hi> are
					established terms for being prolix &amp; tiresome. I thought that We were fallen, but they are ten times lower. </p>
				<p>Notwithstanding all I have said, I have found two or three Societies that please me; am amused with the Novelty of the whole, &amp;
					shoud be sorry not to have come. The Dumenil<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2665tm" /> is, if possible, superior to What you remember; I am
					sorry not to see the Clairon,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2666tm" /> but several persons whose judgments seem the soundest, prefer the
					Former. Preville<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2667tm" /> is admirable in low Comedy: the mixture of Italian Comedy &amp; Comic operas
					prettily written, &amp; set to Italian music, at the same Theatre, is charming, &amp; gets the better both of their operas and French
					Comedy, the latter of which is seldom full, with all it's merit. Petit Maitres are obsolete, like our Lords Foppington<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2668tm" /> &#x2013; Tout le Monde est Philosophe &#x2013; when I grow very sick of this last nonsense, I go &amp;
					compose myself at the Chartreuse, where I am almost tempted to prefer Le Sœur<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2669tm" /> to every Painter I know
					&#x2013; yet what new old Treasures are come to light, routed out of the Louvre, &amp; thrown into new lumber-rooms at Versailles!

				<p>I am very much obliged to you for the detail you enter into on the subject of your own health: in this you cannot be too
					circumstantial for me, who had received no account of you, but at second hand &#x2013; such as, that you were dangerously ill, and
					therefore went to France; that you meant to try a better climate, and therefore staid at Paris; that you had relapsed, and were
					confined to your bed, and extremely in vogue, and supped in the best company, and were at all public diversions. I rejoice to find
					(improbable as it seemed) that all the wonderful part of this is strictly true, and that the serious part has been a little
					exaggerated. This latter I conclude not so much from your own account of yourself, as from the spirits in which I see you write; and
					long may they continue to support you! I mean in a reasonable degree of elevation: but if (take notice) they are so volatile, so
					flippant, as to suggest any of those doctrines of health, which you preach with all the zeal of a French atheist; at least, if they
					really do influence your practice; I utterly renounce them and all their works. They are <hi rend="italic">evil spirits,</hi> and will
					lead you to destruction. &#x2013; You have long built your hopes on temperance, you say, and hardiness. On the first point we are
					agreed. The second has totally disappointed you, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> you will persist in it; by all means. But then be
					sure to persist too in being young, in stopping the course of time, and making the shadow return back upon your sun-dial. If you find
					this not so easy, acquiesce with a good grace in my <hi rend="italic">anilities,</hi> put on your understockings of yarn or woollen,
					even in the night-time. Don't provoke me! or I shall order you two night-caps (which by the way would do your eyes good), and put a
					little of any French liqueur into your water: they are nothing but brandy and sugar, and among their various flavours some of them may
					surely be palatable enough. The pain in your feet I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> bear; but I shudder at the sickness in your stomach, and
					the weakness, that still continues. I conjure you, as you love yourself; I conjure you by Strawberry, not to trifle with these
					edge-tools. There is no cure for the gout, when in the stomach, but to throw it into the limbs. There is no relief for the gout in the
					limbs, but in gentle warmth and gradual perspiration.</p>
				<p>I was much entertained with your account of our neighbours. As an Englishman and an Antigallican, I rejoice at their dulness and
					their nastiness: though I fear we shall come to imitate them in both. Their atheism is a little too much, too shocking to rejoice at. I
					have been long sick at it in their authors, and hated them for it: but I pity their poor innocent people of fashion. They were bad
					enough, when they believed every thing! </p>
				<p>I have searched where you directed me; which I could not do sooner, as I was at London when I received your letter, and could not
					easily find her grace's<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2679tm" /> works. Here they abound in every library. The print you ask after is the
					frontispiece to <hi rend="italic">Nature's pictures drawn by Fancy's pencil.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2680tm" /> But lest there should be any mistake, I must tell you, the family are not at dinner, but sitting
					round a rousing fire and telling stories. The room is just such a one as we lived in at Rheims:<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2681tm" /> I
					mean as to the glazing and ceiling. The chimney is supported by cariatides: over the mantle-piece the arms of the family. The duke and
					duchess are crowned with laurel. A servant stands behind him, holding a hat and feather. Another is shutting a window. Diepenbecke
					delin. &amp; (I think) S. Clouwe<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2682tm" /> sculps. It is a very pretty and curious print, and I thank you for
					the sight of it. If it ever was a picture, what a picture to have!</p>
				<p>I must tell you, that upon cleaning an old picture here at St. John's Lodge, which I always took for a Holbein;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2683tm" /> on a ring, which the figure wears, they have found H. H. It has been always called [Bp] Fisher;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg2a.2684tm" /> but is plainly a layman, and probably sir Anthony Denny,<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2685tm" /> who was a
					benefactor to the college.</p>
				<p>What is come of your Sevigné-curiosity?<anchor xml:id="id_tg2a.2686tm" /> I should be glad of a line now and then, when you have
					leisure.</p>

					<salute> Dear Molly </salute>
				</opener>
				<p> I am almost afraid of advising you for fear I should hurt, where I mean to serve you.</p>
				<p> I think M<hi rend="super">r</hi> M: &amp; your Friends in Town mean exceedingly well, &amp; deserve your acknowledgements: but when
					they propose this method of proceeding, they are ignorant of what has passed.</p>
				<p> I entirely approve of your answer in every respect, as it is. what if you added to it, (as in confidence to M<hi rend="super">r</hi>
					M:,) that a Friend of yours had found means to recommend you not long since to the two Lords at the head of that Board, &amp; had
					received a very favourable answer in case of your Mamma's death. that you have reason to believe, there was nobody before you on their
					list, &amp; that they would not easily give ear to any applications made to your prejudice.</p>
				<p> That nevertheless you were conscious, many accidents might arise to disappoint these hopes; &amp; fully sensible of how much
					consequence the kind foresight &amp; assistance of the M<hi rend="super">r</hi> P:<hi rend="super">s</hi> may be to you in all senses;
					&amp; that you therefore did desire M<hi rend="super">r</hi> M: would communicate your letter (if he thinks it proper) to them, &amp;
					entreat the continuance of their favourable intentions to you &amp; to your Sister.</p>
				<p> This you will put into your own style (w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> is always best) but before you do so, consider whether it agree
					with your own sentiments, &amp; whether you foresee any ill, that may arise from it, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> does not occur to me:
					for my notion is, that generally People judge best upon due reflection in their own affairs.</p>

					<dateline>Paris, January 25, 1766. </dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>I am much indebted to you for your kind letter and advice; and though it is late to thank you for it, it is at least a stronger proof
					that I do not forget it. However, I am a little obstinate, as you know, on the chapter of health, and have persisted through this
					Siberian winter in not adding a grain to my clothes, and in going open-breasted without an under-waistcoat. In short, though I like
					extremely to live, it must be in my own way, as long as I can: it is not youth I court, but liberty; and I think making one's self
					tender, is issuing a <hi rend="italic">general warrant</hi> against one's own person. I suppose I shall submit to confinement, when I
					cannot help it; but I am indifferent enough to life not to care if it ends soon after my prison begins.</p>
				<p>I have not delayed so long to answer your letter, from not thinking of it, or from want of matter, but from want of time. I am
					constantly occupied, engaged, amused, till I cannot bring a hundredth part of what I have to say into the compass of a letter. You will
					lose nothing by this: you know my volubility, when I am full of new subjects; and I have at least many hours of conversation for you at
					my return. One does not learn a whole nation in four or five months; but, for the time, few, I believe, have seen, studied, or got so
					much acquainted with the French as I have. </p>
				<p>By what I said of their religious or rather irreligious opinions, you must not conclude their people of quality, atheists&#x2013;at
					least not the men&#x2013;Happily for them, poor souls! they are not capable of going so far into thinking. They assent to a great deal,
					because it is the fashion, and because they don't know how to contradict. They are ashamed to defend the Roman catholic religion,
					because it is quite exploded; but I am convinced they believe it in their hearts. They hate the parliaments and the philosophers, and
					are rejoiced that they may still idolize royalty. At present too they are a little triumphant: the court has shown a little spirit, and
					the parliaments much less: but as the duc de Choiseul,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.5tm" /> who is very fluttering, unsettled, and inclined
					to the philosophers, has made a compromise with the parliament of Bretagne, the parliaments might venture out again, if, as I fancy
					will be the case, they are not glad to drop a cause, of which they began to be a little weary of the inconveniences. </p>
				<p>The generality of the men, and more than the generality, are dull and empty. They have taken up gravity, thinking it was philosophy
					and English, and so have acquired nothing in the room of their natural levity and cheerfulness. However, as their high opinion of their
					own country remains, for which they can no longer assign any reason, they are contemptuous and reserved, instead of being ridiculously,
					consequently pardonably, impertinent. I have wondered, knowing my own countrymen, that we had attained such a superiority.&#x2013;I
					wonder no longer, and have a little more respect for English <hi rend="italic">heads</hi> than I had.</p>
				<p>The women do not seem of the same country: if they are less gay than they were, they are more informed, enough to make them very
					conversable. I know six or seven with very superior understandings; some of them with wit, or with softness, or very good sense. </p>
				<p>Madame Geoffrin,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.6tm" /> of whom you have heard much, is an extraordinary woman, with more common sense than I
					almost ever met with. Great quickness in discovering characters, penetration in going to the bottom of them, and a pencil that never
					fails in a likeness&#x2013;seldom a favourable one. She exacts and preserves, spite of her birth and their nonsensical prejudices about
					nobility, great court and attention. This she acquires by a thousand little arts and offices of friendship; and by a freedom and
					severity, which seems to be her sole end of drawing a concourse to her; for she insists on scolding those she inveigles to her. She has
					little taste and less knowledge, but protects artisans<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.7tm" /> and authors, and courts a few people to have the
					credit of serving her dependents. She was bred under the famous madame Tencin,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.8tm" /> who advised her never to
					refuse any man; for, said her mistress, though nine in ten should not care a farthing for you, the tenth may live to be an useful
					friend. She did not adopt or reject the whole plan, but fully retained the purport of the maxim. In short, she is an epitome of empire,
					subsisting by rewards and punishments. Her great enemy, madame du Deffand,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.9tm" /> was for a short time mistress
					of the regent, is now very old and stone blind, but retains all her vivacity, wit, memory, judgment, passions, and agreeableness. She
					goes to operas, plays, suppers, and Versailles; gives suppers twice a week; has every thing new read to her; makes new songs and
					epigrams, aye, admirably, and remembers every one that has been made these fourscore years. She corresponds with Voltaire, dictates
					charming letters to him, contradicts him, is no bigot to him or any body, and laughs both at the clergy and the philosophers. In a
					dispute, into which she easily falls, she is very warm, and yet scarce ever in the wrong: her judgment on every subject is as just as
					possible; on every point of conduct as wrong as possible: for she is all love and hatred, passionate for her friends to enthusiasm,
					still anxious to be loved, I don't mean by lovers, and a vehement enemy, but openly. As she can have no amusement but conversation, the
					least solitude and ennui are insupportable to her, and put her into the power of several worthless people, who eat her suppers when
					they can eat nobody's of higher rank; wink to one another and laugh at her; hate her because she has forty times more parts&#x2013;and
					venture to hate her because she is not rich. She has an old friend whom I must mention, a monsieur Pondevelle,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.10tm" /> author of the Fat Puni, and the Complaisant, and of those pretty novels, the Comte de Cominge, the Siege of
					Calais, and les Malheurs de l'Amour. Would not you expect this old man to be very agreeable? He can be so, but seldom is: yet he has
					another very different and very amusing talent, the art of parody, and is unique in his kind. He composes tales to the tunes of long
					dances: for instance, he has adapted the Regent's Daphnis and Chloe to one, and made it ten times more indecent; but is so old and
					sings it so well, that it is permitted in all companies. He has succeeded still better in les characteres de la danse, to which he has
					adapted words that express all the characters of love. With all this, he has not the least idea of cheerfulness in conversation; seldom
					speaks but on grave subjects, and not often on them; is a humourist, very supercilious, and wrapt up in admiration of his own country,
					as the only judge of his merit. His air and look are cold and forbidding; but ask him to sing, or praise his works, his eyes and smiles
					open and brighten up. In short, I can show him to you: the self-applauding poet in Hogarth's Rake's Progress, the second print, is so
					like his very features and very wig, that you would know him by it, if you came hither&#x2013;for he certainly will not go to you. </p>
				<p>Madame de Mirepoix's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.11tm" /> understanding is excellent of the useful kind, and can be so when she pleases of
					the agreeable kind. She has read, but seldom shows it, and has perfect taste. Her manner is cold, but very civil; and she conceals even
					the blood of Lorrain, without ever forgetting it. Nobody in France knows the world better, and nobody is personally so well with the
					king. She is false, artful, and insinuating beyond measure when it is her interest, but indolent and a coward. She never had any
					passion but gaming, and always loses. For ever paying court, the sole produce of a life of art is to get money from the king to carry
					on a course of paying debts or contracting new ones, which she discharges as fast as she is able. She advertised devotion to get made
					dame du palais to the queen; and the very next day this princess of Lorrain was seen riding backwards with madame Pompadour in the
					latter's coach. When the king was stabbed and heartily frightened, the mistress took a panic too, and consulted d'Argenson,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.12tm" /> whether she had not best make off in time. He hated her, and said, By all means. Madame de Mirepoix advised
					her to stay. The king recovered his spirits, d'Argenson was banished, and la marechale inherited part of the mistress's
					credit.&#x2013;I must interrupt my history of illustrious women with an anecdote of monsieur de Maurepas,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.13tm"
					 /> with whom I am much acquainted, and who has one of the few heads that approach to good ones, and who luckily for us was disgraced,
					and the marine dropped, because it was his favourite object and province. He employed Pondevelle to make a song on the Pompadour: it
					was clever and bitter, and did not spare even majesty. This was Maurepas absurd enough to sing at supper at Versailles. Banishment
					ensued; and lest he should ever be restored, the mistress persuaded the king that he had poisoned her predecessor madame de
						Chateauroux.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.14tm" /> Maurepas is very agreeable, and exceedingly cheerful; yet I have seen a transient silent
					cloud when politics are talked of.</p>
				<p>Madame de Boufflers,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.15tm" /> who was in England, is a sçavante, mistress of the prince of Conti,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.16tm" /> and very desirous of being his wife. She is two women, the upper and the lower. I need not tell you that the
					lower is galant, and still has pretensions. The upper is very sensible too, and has a measured eloquence that is just and
					pleasing&#x2013;but all is spoiled by an unrelaxed attention to applause. You would think she was always sitting for her picture to her
					biographer.</p>
				<p>Madame de Rochfort<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.17tm" /> is different from all the rest. Her understanding is just and delicate; with a
					finesse of wit that is the result of reflection. Her manner is soft and feminine, and though a sçavante, without any declared
					pretensions. She is the <hi rend="italic">decent</hi> friend of monsieur de Nivernois;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.18tm" /> for you must not
					believe a syllable of what you read in their novels. It requires the greatest curiosity, or the greatest habitude, to discover the
					smallest connection between the sexes here. No familiarity, but under the veil of friendship, is permitted, and love's dictionary is as
					much prohibited, as at first sight one should think his ritual was. All you hear, and that pronounced with nonchalance, is, that <hi
						rend="italic">monsieur un tel</hi> has had <hi rend="italic">madame une telle.</hi> The duc de Nivernois has parts, and writes at the
					top of the mediocre, but, as madame Geoffrin says, is <hi rend="italic">manqué par tout; guerrier manqué, ambassadeur manqué, homme
						d'affaires manqué,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">auteur manqué</hi>&#x2013; no, he is not <hi rend="italic">homme de naissance
						manqué.</hi> He would think freely, but has some ambition of being governor to the dauphin,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.19tm" /> and is
					more afraid of his wife<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.20tm" /> and daughter,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.21tm" /> who are ecclesiastic fagots. The
					former out-chatters the duke of Newcastle; and the latter, madame de Gisors, exhausts Mr. Pitt's eloquence in defence of the
						archbishop<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.22tm" /> of Paris. Monsieur de Nivernois lives in a small circle of dependent admirers, and madame
					de Rochfort is high priestess for a small salary of credit.</p>
				<p>The duchess of Choiseul,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.23tm" /> the only young one of these heroines, is not very pretty, but has fine eyes,
					and is a little model in wax-work, which not being allowed to speak for some time as incapable, has a hesitation and modesty, the
					latter of which the court has not cured, and the former of which is atoned for by the most interesting sound of voice, and forgotten in
					the most elegant turn and propriety of expression. Oh! it is the gentlest, amiable, civil, little creature that ever came out of a
					fairy egg! So just in its phrases and thoughts, so attentive and good-natured! Every body loves it, but its husband, who prefers his
					own sister the duchesse de Grammont,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.24tm" /> an amazonian, fierce, haughty dame, who loves and hates
					arbitrarily, and is detested. Madame de Choiseul, passionately fond of her husband, was the martyr of this union, but at last submitted
					with a good grace; has gained a little credit with him, and is still believed to idolize him&#x2013;But I doubt it&#x2013;she takes too
					much pains to profess it.</p>
				<p>I cannot finish my list without adding a much more common character&#x2013;but more complete in its kind than any of the foregoing,
					the marechale de Luxembourg.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.25tm" /> She has been very handsome, very abandoned, and very mischievous. Her
					beauty is gone, her lovers are gone, and she thinks the devil is coming. This dejection has softened her into being rather agreeable,
					for she has wit and good-breeding; but you would swear, by the restlessness of her person and the horrors she cannot conceal, that she
					had signed the compact, and expected to be called upon in a week for the performance. </p>
				<p>I could add many pictures, but none so remarkable. In those I send you, there is not a feature bestowed gratis or exaggerated. For
					the beauties, of which there are a few considerable, as mesdames de Brionne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.26tm" /> de Monaco,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.27tm" /> et d'Egmont,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.28tm" /> they have not yet lost their characters, nor got any.</p>
				<p>You must not attribute my intimacy with Paris to curiosity alone. An accident unlocked the doors for me. That <hi rend="italic"
						>passe-partout,</hi> called the fashion, has made them fly open&#x2013;and what do you think was that fashion?&#x2013;I
					myself&#x2013;Yes, like queen Elinor in the ballad, I sunk at Charing-cross,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.29tm" /> and have risen in the
					fauxbourg St. Germain. A <hi rend="italic">plaisanterie</hi> on Rousseau,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.30tm" /> whose arrival here in his way
					to you brought me acquainted with many anecdotes conformable to the idea I had conceived of him, got about, was liked much more than it
					deserved, spread like wildfire, and made me the subject of conversation. Rousseau's devotees were offended. Madame de Boufflers, with a
					tone of sentiment, and the accents of lamenting humanity, abused me heartily, and then complained to myself with the utmost softness. I
					acted contrition, but had like to have spoiled all, by growing dreadfully tired of a second lecture from the prince of Conti, who took
					up the ball, and made himself the hero of a history wherein he had nothing to do. I listened, did not understand half he said (nor he
					neither), forgot the rest, said Yes when I should have said No, yawned when I should have smiled, and was very penitent when I should
					have rejoiced at my pardon. Madame de Boufflers was more distressed, for he owned twenty times more than I had said: she frowned, and
					made him signs; but she had wound up his clack, and there was no stopping it. The moment she grew angry, the [lord of the house]<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.31tm" /> grew charmed, and it has been my fault if I am not at the head of a numerous sect:&#x2013;but when I left a
					triumphant party in England, I did not come hither to be at the head of a fashion. However, I have been sent for about like an African
					prince or a learned canary-bird, and was, in particular, carried by force to the princess of Talmond,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.32tm" />
					the queen's cousin, who lives in a charitable apartment in the Luxembourg, and was sitting on a small bed hung with saints and
					Sobieskis, in a corner of one of those vast chambers, by two blinking tapers. I stumbled over a cat, a foot-stool, and a chamber-pot in
					my journey to her presence. She could not find a syllable to say to me, and the visit ended with her begging a lap-dog. Thank the Lord!

					has interrupted my Sevigné-researches but the frost. The abbé de Malesherbes has given me full power to ransack Livry. I did not tell

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I am amazed at myself, when I think I have never wrote to you:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.35tm" /> to be sure it is the sin of witchcraft
					or something worse. something indeed might be said for it, had I been married like Mason, who (for the first time since that great
					event) has just thought fit to tell me, that he never pass'd so happy a winter as the last, &amp; this in spite of his anxieties, wch
					perhaps (he says) might even make a part of his happiness: for his Wife is by no means in health, she has a constant cough, yet he is
					assured, her lungs are not affected, &amp; that it is nothing of the consumptive kind. what say you to this case? may I flatter him,
					that breeding will be a cure for this disorder? if so, I hear she is in a fair way to be well. as to me I have been neither happy, nor
					miserable: but in a gentle stupefaction of mind, &amp; very tolerable health of body hitherto. if they last, I shall not much complain.
					the accounts one has lately had from all parts make me suppose you buried under the snow,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.36tm" /> like the old
					Queen of Denmark:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.37tm" /> as soon as you are dug out, I should rejoice to hear your voice from the battlements
					of Old-Park. the greatest cold we have felt here was Jan: 2, Thermom: (in the garden) at 4 in the afternoon standing at 30 Deg: ½, and
					next day fell a little snow, wch did not lie. it was the first we had had during the winter. again, Feb: 5 toward night, Therm: was
					down at 30 D: with a clear sky; the snow-drops then beginning to blow in the garden: next day was a little snow. but on the 11th &amp;
					12th fell a deep snow (the weather not very cold) wch however was melted on ye 15th, &amp; made a flood in the river. next day the
					Thrush was singing, &amp; the Rooks building. at &amp; about London instead of snow they had heavy rains. on the 19th the red Hepatica
					blew, &amp; next day the Primrose. the Crocus is now in full bloom. so ends my chronicle. </p>
				<p>My oracle<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.38tm" /> of state (who now &amp; then utters a little, as far as he may with discretion) is a very
					slave &amp; pack-horse, that never breaths any air better than that of London, except like an Apprentice, on Sundays with his
						Master<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.39tm" /> and Co:. however he is in health, &amp; a very good Boy. it is strange, the turn that things
					have taken. that the late Ministry should negociate a reconciliation with Ld B:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.40tm" /> &amp; that Ld Temple
					should join them; that they should after making their (bad) apologies be received with a gracious kind of contempt, &amp; told that his
					Ldp: could enter into no political connections with them: that on the first division on the American business<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.41tm" /> that happen'd in the H: of Lords they should however all join to carry a point against the Ministry by a
					majority indeed of four only, but the D: of Y&#x2013;k<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.42tm" /> present &amp; making one: that when the
					Ministers expostulated in a proper place, they should be seriously assured the K: would support them. that on a division on an
					insignificant point to try their strength in the H: of Commons they should again lose it by 12 majority: that they should persist
					nevertheless: that Mr Pitt should appear <hi rend="italic">tanquam e machinâ,</hi> speak for 3 hours &amp; ½, &amp; assert the rights
					of the Colonies in their greatest latitude:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.43tm" /> that the Minister<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.44tm" /> should
					profess himself ready to act with &amp; even serve under him: that he should receive such a compliment with coldness, &amp; a sort of
					derision: that Norton<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.45tm" /> should move to send him to the Tower: that when the great questions came on, the
					Miny: should always carry their point at one, two, three in the morning by majorities of 110 &amp; 170 (Mr Pitt entirely concurring
					with them, &amp; the Tories, People of the Court, &amp; many Placemen, even Ld G: Sackville,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.46tm" /> constantly
					voting against them) all these events are unaccountable on any principles of common-sense. I attribute much of the singular part to the
					interposition of <hi rend="italic">Women</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.47tm" /> as rash as they are foolish. on Monday<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.48tm" /> (I do not doubt, tho' as yet I
					do not certainly know it) the Bill to repeal the Stamp-act went thro' that House, &amp; to-day it is before the Lords, who surely will
					not venture to throw it out.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.49tm" /> oh, that they would!&#x2013;but after this important business is well
					over, there must be an eclaircissement: some amends must be made &amp; some gracious condescensions insisted on, or else who would go
					on, that really means to serve his country! The D: of Bedford &amp; Ld Temple were gone down to their Villas, &amp; I believe are not
					likely to come back. Ld Chesterfield, who had not been for many years at the house, came the other day to qualify himself in order to
					leave a proxy, that should vote with the Ministry.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.50tm" /> some body (I thought) made no bad application of
					those lines in Virgil L: 6. v: 489 <q>
						<p>At Danaum proceres, Agamemnoniæq phalanges &amp;c:</p>
					</q> to Mr Pitt's first appearance (for no one expected him) in the house. turn to the place.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.51tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Every thing is politicks. there are no literary productions worth your notice, at least of our country. the French have finish'd
					their great Encyclopedie<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.52tm" /> in 17 Volumes: but there<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.53tm" /> are many flimsey
					articles very hastily treated, &amp; great incorrectness of the Press. there are now 13 Vol: of Buffon's Natural History,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.54tm" /> &amp; he is not come to the Monkies yet, who are a very numerous people. the Life of Petrarch has entertain'd
					me: it is not well written, but very curious &amp; laid together from his own letters &amp; the original writings of the 14th Century:
					so that it takes in much of the history of those obscure times, &amp; the characters of many remarkable persons. there are 2 vols: 4to,
					&amp; another (unpublish'd yet) that will compleat it.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.55tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Mr W:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.56tm" /> writes me now &amp; then a long and lively letter from Paris, to wch place he went the last
					summer with the gout upon him sometimes in his limbs, often in his stomach &amp; head. he has got somehow well (not by means of the
					climate, one would think) goes to all publick places, sees all the best company &amp; is very much in fashion. he says, he sunk like
					Queen Eleanour<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.57tm" /> at Charing-Cross, &amp; has risen again at Paris. he returns again in April: but his
					health is certainly in a deplorable state. Mad: de la Perriere<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.58tm" /> is come over from the Hague to be
					Ministress at London. her Father-in-law Viry<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.59tm" /> is now first Minister at Turin. I sate a morning with her
					before I left London. she is a prodigious fine Lady, &amp; a Catholick<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.60tm2" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.60tm1" /> (tho' she did not expressly own it to me) not fatter than she was: she had a cage of foreign birds
					&amp; a piping Bullfinch at her elbow, two little Dogs on a cushion in her lap, a Cockatoo on her shoulder, &amp; a sl[ight]<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.60tm" /> suspicion of Rouge on her cheeks. They were all exceeding glad to [see]<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.61tm" /> me,
					&amp; I them.</p>
				<p>Pray tell me the history of your winter, &amp; present my respects to Mrs Wharton. I hope Miss Wharton &amp; Miss Peggy with the

				<p>To-morrow morning I set out for Canterbury.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.67tm" /> If any letter comes, I believe it will be better to
					direct to me as usual at Mr. Roberts's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.68tm" /> here, and he will take care to send it. I know not how long my

				<p>You expect to hear who is Secretary of State.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.70tm" /> I cannot tell. It is sure this morning it was not

				<p>It is long since that I heard you were gone in hast into Yorkshire<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.91tm" /> on account of your Mother's
					illness, &amp; the same letter inform'd me, that she was recover'd. otherwise I had then wrote to you only to beg you would take care
					of her, &amp; to inform you, that I had discover'd a thing very little known, wch is, that in one's whole life one never can have any
					more than a single Mother. you may think this is obvious, &amp; (what you call) a trite observation. you are a green Gossling! I was at
					the same age (very near) as wise as you, &amp; yet I never discover'd this (with full evidence &amp; conviction, I mean) till it was
					too late. it is 13 years ago,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.92tm" /> &amp; seems but yesterday, &amp; every day I live it sinks deeper into my
						heart.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.93tm" /> many a corollary could I draw from this axiom for your use (not for my own) but I will leave
					you the merit of doing it yourself. pray, tell me how your own health is. I conclude it perfect, as I hear you offer'd yourself for a
					guide to Mr Palgrave into the Sierra-Morena of Yorkshire. for me I pass'd the end of May &amp; all June in Kent not disagreeably. the
					country is all a garden, gay, rich, &amp; fruitfull, &amp; (from the rainy season) had preserved, till I left it, all that emerald
					verdure, wch commonly one only sees for the first fortnight of the spring. in the west part of it from every eminence the eye catches
					some long winding reach of the Thames or Medway with all their navigation. in the east the sea breaks in upon you, &amp; mixes its
					white transient sails &amp; glittering blew expanse with the deeper &amp; brighter greens of the woods &amp; corn. this last sentence
					is so fine<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.94tm" /> I am quite ashamed. but no matter! you must translate it into prose. Palgrave, if he heard
					it, would cover his face with his pudding-sleeve.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.95tm" /> I went to Margate for a day:<anchor

					things innumerable that I met with, because you do not suspect, that this world is inhabited by any thing but Men &amp; Women, &amp;

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Whatever my pen may do, I am sure my thoughts expatiate no where oftener or with more pleasure than to Old-Park. I hope you have made
					my peace with Miss Debo:.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.111tm" /> it is certain, whether her name were in my letter<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.112tm" /> or not, she was as present to my memory, as the rest of the little family, &amp; I desire you would present
					her with two kisses in my name, &amp; one apiece to all the others: for I shall take the liberty to kiss them all (great &amp; small)
					as you are to be my proxy.</p>
				<p>In spite of the rain, wch I think continued with very short intervals till the beginning of this month, &amp; quite effaced the
					summer from the year, I made a shift to pass May &amp; June not disagreeably in Kent. I was surprised at the beauty of the road to
					Canterbury, wch (I know not why) had not struck me in the same manner before. the whole county is a rich &amp; well-cultivated garden,
					orchards, cherry-grounds, hop-gardens, intermix'd with corn &amp; frequent villages, gentle risings cover'd with wood, and every where
					the Thames &amp; Medway breaking in upon the Landscape with all their navigation. it was indeed owing to the bad weather, that the
					whole scene was dress'd in that tender emerald-green, wch one usually sees only for a fortnight in the opening of spring, &amp; this
					continued till I left the country. my residence was eight miles east of Canterbury in a little quiet valley on the skirts of
						Barham-down.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.113tm" /> in these parts the whole soil is chalk, and whenever it holds up, in half an hour it is
					dry enough to walk out. I took the opportunity of three or four days fine weather to go into the Isle of Thanet, saw Margate (wch is
					Bartholomew-Fair by the seaside) Ramsgate, &amp; other places there, &amp; so came by Sandwich, Deal, Dover, Folkstone, &amp; Hithe
					back again. the coast is not like Hartlepool: there are no rocks, but only chalky cliffs of no great height, till you come to Dover.
					there indeed they are noble &amp; picturesque, &amp; the opposite coasts of France begin to bound your view, wch was left before to
					range unlimited by any thing but the horizon: yet it is by no means a <hi rend="italic">shipless</hi> sea, but every where peopled with
					white sails &amp; vessels of all sizes in motion; and take notice (except in the Isle, wch is all corn-fields, &amp; has very little
					inclosure) there are in all places hedge-rows &amp; tall trees even within a few yards of the beach, particularly Hithe stands on an
					eminence cover'd with wood. I shall confess we had fires of a night (ay, &amp; a day too) several times even in June: but don't go
					&amp; take advantage of this, for it was the most untoward year that ever I remember.</p>
				<p>Your Friend Rousseau (I doubt) grows tired of Mr Davenport &amp; Derbyshire.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.114tm" /> he has pick'd a quarrel
					with David Hume &amp; writes him letters of 14 pages Folio upbraiding him with all his <hi rend="italic">noirceurs.</hi> take one only
					as a specimen, he says, that at Calais they chanced to sleep in the same room together, &amp; that he overheard David talking in his
					sleep, &amp; saying, <hi rend="italic">Ah! Je le tiens, ce Jean-Jacques lá.</hi> In short (I fear) for want of persecution &amp;
					admiration (for these are his real complaints) he will go back to the continent.</p>
				<p>What shall I say to you about the Ministry?<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.115tm" /> I am as angry as a Common-council Man of London about my
					Ld Chatham:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.116tm" /> but a little more patient, &amp; will hold my tongue till the end of the year. in the mean
					time I do mutter in secret &amp; to you, that to quit the house of Commons, his natural strength; to sap his own popularity &amp;
					grandeur (which no one but himself could have done) by assuming a foolish title; &amp; to hope that he could win by it &amp; attach to
					him a Court, that hate him, &amp; will dismiss him, as soon as ever they dare, was the weakest thing, that ever was done by so great a
					Man. had it not been for this, I should have rejoiced at the breach between him &amp; Ld Temple,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.117tm" /> &amp;
					at the union between him &amp; the D: of Grafton &amp; Mr Conway: but patience! we shall see! St:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.118tm" />
					perhaps is in the country (for he hoped for a month's leave of absence) &amp; if you see him, you will learn more than I can tell
					you.</p>
				<p>Mason is at Aston. he is no longer so anxious about his Wife's health, as he was, tho' I find she still has a cough, &amp;
						moreover<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.119tm" /> I find she is not with child: but he made such a bragging, how could one chuse but believe
					him.</p>
				<p>When I was in town, I mark'd in my pocket-book the utmost limits &amp; division of the two columns in your Thermometer, &amp; ask'd
					Mr. Ayscough<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.120tm" /> the Instrument-Maker on Ludgate Hill, what scales they were. he immediately assured me,
					that one was Fahrenheit's, &amp; shew'd me one exactly so divided. the other he took for Reaumur's, but, as he said there were
					different scales of his contrivance, he could not exactly tell, wch of them it was. your Brother<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.121tm" /> told
					me, you wanted to know, who wrote Duke Wharton's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.122tm" /> Life in the Biography:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.123tm"
					 /> I think, it is chiefly borrowed from a silly book enough call'd <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of that Duke</hi>:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.124tm" /> but who put it together there, no one can inform me. the only person certainly known to write in that vile
					collection (I mean these latter volumes) is Dr Nicholls,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.125tm" /> who was expell'd here for stealing books.</p>
				<p>Have you read the <hi rend="italic">New Bath-Guide?</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.126tm" /> it is the only [thing]<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.127tm" /> in fashion, &amp; is a new &amp; original
					kind of humour. Miss Prue's Conversion<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.128tm" /> I doubt you will paste down, as Sr W: St Quintyn<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.129tm" /> did, before he carried it to his daughter. yet I remember you all read <hi rend="italic">Crazy Tales</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.130tm" /> without pasting. Buffon's first collection of Monkies are come out (it makes the 14th volume)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.131tm" /> something, but not much, to my edification: for he is pretty well acquainted with their persons, but not
					with their manners.</p>
				<p>I shall be glad to hear, how far Mrs Ettrick<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.132tm" /> has succeeded, &amp; when you see an end to her
					troubles. my best respects to Mrs. Wharton, &amp; compliments to all your family: I will not name them, least I should affront any

					all his <hi rend="italic">unblushing</hi> honours thick upon him; when the Gout has nip'd him in the bud, &amp; blasted all his hopes
					at least for one winter: then come you buzzing about his nose, &amp; strike your sting deep into the reddest angriest part of his toe,
					wch will surely mortify. when another<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.140tm" /> has been weak enough in the plenitude of power to disarm himself

						rend="italic">hoping</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.142tm" /> what I (with all my old partialities) scarce should dare to hope, if I had but any one else to put my

					see) will be a Bishopess.</p>
				<p>Well, I transcribed your wickedness in a print-hand &amp; sent it by last Sunday's post to Dr G:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.143tm" />
					with your orders about it, for I had heard St: say, that he hoped for a month's respite<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.144tm" /> to go into the

					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.146tm" /> part of it: I fear, it will not keep, &amp; would have wish'd the Publick might have eat it fresh:
					but if any untoward accident should delay it, it will be still better than most things, that appear at their table. </p>

					<salute>My dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I was absent in Suffolk,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.149tm" /> &amp; did not receive your melancholy letter till my return hither
					yesterday: so you must not attribute this delay to me, but to accident. to sympathize with you in such a loss<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.150tm" /> is an easy task for me: but to comfort you not so easy. can I wish to see you unaffected with the sad scene
					now before your eyes, or with the loss of a person, that thro' a great part of your life has proved himself so kind a Friend to you? he
					who best knows our nature (for he made us, what we are) by such afflictions recalls us from our wandering thoughts &amp; idle
					merriment, from the insolence of youth &amp; prosperity, to serious reflection, to our duty &amp; to himself: nor need we hasten to get
					rid of these impressions; Time (by appointment of the same Power) will cure the smart, &amp; in some hearts soon blot out all the
					traces of sorrow: but such as preserve them longest (for it is left partly in our own power) do perhaps best acquiesce in the will of
					the Chastiser. </p>
				<p>For the consequences of this sudden loss<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.151tm" /> I see them well, &amp; (I think) in a like situation could
					fortify my mind so as to support them with chearfulness &amp; good hopes, tho' not naturally inclined to see things in their best
					aspect. your Cousins<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.152tm" /> seem naturally kind &amp; well-disposed worthy young People: your Mother &amp;
					they will assist one another. you too (when you have time to turn you round) must think seriously of your profession.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.153tm" /> you know I would have wish'd to see you wear the livery of it long ago. but I will not dwell on this subject
					at present. to be obliged to those we love &amp; esteem is a pleasure: but to serve &amp; to oblige them is a still greater, &amp; this
					with independence (no vulgar blessings) are what a Profession at your age may reasonably promise. without it they are hardly
					attainable. remember, I speak from experience!</p>
				<p>Poor Mr. W: is struck with a paralytick disorder.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.154tm" /> I know it only from the papers, but think it very
					likely. he may live in this state, incapable of assisting himself, in the hands of servants or relations, that only gape after his
					spoils, perhaps for years to come. think, how many things may befall a man far worse than death.</p>

				<p>I happen'd to be in Norfolk on the way to Houghton, when I read an article in a news-paper relating to you, that shock'd me. I wrote
					to Dr Gisburne<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.156tm" /> (who lives very near you) to beg he would inform himself of your health: but I fear he
					is out of Town, for I have received no answer. today by accident I received a letter from Cole,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.157tm" /> from
					whence I learn, thank God! that the worst part of that news was false: but that you have suffer'd much from a return of the gout, &amp;
					are prevented only by weakness from going to Bath. it would be a singular satisfaction to me, if I might see three lines in your own
					hand: but it is impossible for me to judge, whether this is a reasonable request. I flatter myself, if you can, you will indulge me in
					it, especially when you know, that of those who are most about you, there is no one I can well write to. in a fortnight or less I hope
					to be in Town. Heaven preserve you, &amp; restore you to health &amp; ease. I hope this severe lesson will warn you against that
					careless regimen, to wch you were so unreasonably attach'd.</p>

					<salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I was going to write to you, when I received your letter, and on the same subject.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.159tm" /> the first news I
					had was from St:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.160tm" /> on the 23d. of Sept: in these words:</p>
				<p>'This morning Dr B: dispatch'd himself: he had been for several days past very low-spirited, &amp; within the last two or three
					talk'd of the necessity of dying in such a manner as to alarm the people about him: they removed as they thought every thing, that
					might serve his purpose. but he had contrived to get at a razor unknown to them, &amp; took the advantage of a minute's absence of his
					servants to make use of it.' I wrote to him again (I suspect, he knows our secret,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.161tm" /> tho' not from me)
					to make farther enquiries, &amp; he says, 27 Sept:, 'I have tried to find out, whether there was any appearance or cause of discontent
					in B:, but can hear of none. a bodily complaint of the gouty kind, that fell upon his nerves &amp; affected his spirits in a very great
					degree is all that I can get any information of; &amp; I am told besides, that he was some years ago in the same dejected way, &amp;
					under the care of <hi rend="italic">proper attendants.</hi>' Mr. W: too in answer to a letter I had written to enquire after his health
					after giving an account of himself, while under the care of Pringle,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.162tm" /> adds, 'He (Pringle) had another
					Patient at the same time, who has ended very unhappily, that poor Dr B:. the unfortunate Man apprehended himself going mad, &amp; two
					nights after cut his throat in bed.' this is all I know at present of the matter. I have told it you literally, &amp; I conceal
					nothing. as I go to town tomorrow, if I learn any thing more, you shall soon hear from me. in the mean time I think we may fairly
					conclude, that if he had had <hi rend="italic">any other</hi> cause added to his constitutional infirmity, it would have been uppermost
					in his mind: he would have talk'd or raved about it, &amp; the first thing we should have heard of, would have been this, wch (I do
					assure you) I have never heard from any body. there is in this neighbourhood a Mr Wale,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.163tm" /> who once was
					in the Russia-trade &amp; married a Woman of that country: he always maintain'd, that Dr B: would never go thither, whatever he might
					pretend; &amp; that tho' fond of the glory of being invited thither, he would certainly find or make a pretence for staying at home.
					very possibly therefore he might have engaged himself so far, that he knew not how to draw back with honour; or might have received
					rough words from the Russian Minister offended with his prevarication. this supposition<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.164tm" /> is at least as
					likely as yours; added to what I have said before, much more so: if it be necessary to suppose any other cause than the lunatick
					disposition of the Man. and yet I will not disguise to you, that I felt as you do on the first news of this sad accident, &amp; had the
					same uneasy ideas about it.</p>
				<p>I am sorry the cause you mention<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.165tm" /> should be the occasion of your coming to London: tho' perhaps
					change of air may do more than medicine. in this length of time I should think you must be fully apprised, whether her looks or
					strength or embon-point have suffer'd by this cough: if not; surely there is no real danger. yet I do not wonder, she should wish to
					get rid of so troublesome a companion.</p>
				<p>When I can meet with the book, I will transcribe what you mention from <hi rend="italic">Mallet.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.166tm" /> I shall write again soon. do you know of any great, or at least rich, family that want a young Man
					worth his weight in gold to take care of their eldest hope. if you do, remember I have such a one,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.167tm" /> or
					shall have (I fear) shortly to sell: but they must not stand haggling about him, &amp; besides they must be very good sort of people
					too, or they shall not have him.</p>

				<p>I have received a second instance of your kindness &amp; confidence in me. and surely you hazard nothing in trusting me with the
					whole of your situation. it appears not to me so new, as it does to you. you well know, the tenour of my conversation (urged perhaps at
					times a little farther than you liked) has been intended to prepare you for this event, to familiarize your mind with this spectre,
					that you call by its worst name: but remember, that <hi rend="italic">Honesta res est læta paupertas.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.175tm" /> I see it with respect, &amp; so will every one, whose poverty is not seated in their mind. there is
					but one real evil in it (take my word, who know it well) &amp; that is, that you have less the power of assisting others, who have not
					the same resources to support them. it is this consideration, that makes me remind you, that <hi rend="italic">Ansel</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.176tm" /> is lately dead, a Lay-fellow of your college. that if Dr M:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.177tm" /> (whose
					follies let us pardon, because he has some feeling &amp; means us well) be of little use, &amp; if Dr H:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.178tm"
					 /> (another simple Friend of ours, perhaps with less sensibility) can not serve us in this: yet Dr R:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.179tm" />
					is not immortal, you have always said to succeed him was not impracticable. I know it would be creditable, I know it would be
					profitable, I know it would in lieu of a little drudgery bring you freedom. that drudgery would with a little use grow easy. in the
					mean time, if any better prospect present itself, there you are ready to take advantage of the opportunity. in short this was always my
					favourite project, &amp; now more than ever for reasons, that will occur to yourself. in waiting for the accomplishment of it, you will
					take orders, &amp; if your Uncles<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.180tm" /> are slow in their motions, you will accept a Curacy (for a title
					will be requisite) not under every body, that offers, but under some gentlemanlike friendly Man, &amp; in a christian country. a
					profession you must have: why not then accommodate yourself chearfully to its beginnings. you have youth, you have many kind
					well-intention'd people belonging to you, many acquaintance of your own, or familie's, that will wish to serve you. consider, how many
					have had the same, or greater cause for dejection with none of these resources before their eyes. </p>
				<p>I am in Town for a month or more, &amp; wish to hear from you soon. Mr. W: has indeed been dangerously ill with the gout in his
					stomach, but nothing paralytick, as was said. he is much recover'd, &amp; gone to Bath.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.181tm" /></p>

					<salute>Dear Sir </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I observed that Ansel<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.183tm" /> was dead, and made the same reflection about it that you did. I also wrote to
					remind N:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.184tm" /> of it, but have heard nothing since. We have great scarcity of news here. Everything is in
					Lord Ch.'s<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.185tm" /> breast. If what lies hid there be no better than what comes to light, I would not give
					sixpence to know it. Spain was certainly offered to Lord Weymouth,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.186tm" /> and in the second place, some say
					to Sandwich; at last, perhaps, Sir James Gray<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.187tm" /> may go. But who goes Secretary<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.188tm" /> do you think? I leave Mr. T.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.189tm" /> and you ten guesses a-piece, and yet they will
					be all wrong. Mr. Prowse<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.190tm" /> has refused the Post Office. I do not believe in any more dukes,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.191tm" /> unless, perhaps, my Lord Marquis of Rockingham should like it. The Prince of Wales has been ill of what they
					call a fever. They say he is better, but Sir J. Pringle<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.192tm" /> continues to lie every night at Kew. My Lady
					&#x2014; has discarded Thynne<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.193tm" /> and taken to Sir T. Delaval,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.194tm" /> they say.
					The clothes are actually making, but possibly she may jilt them both. The clerk who was displaced in the Post Office lost 1,700<hi
						rend="italic">l</hi> a year. Would you think there could be such under-offices there? Have you read Mr. Grenville's
						Considerations<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.195tm" /> on the merits of his own Administration? It is all figures; so, I suppose, it must be
					true. Have you read Mr. Sharp the surgeon's Travels into Italy?<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.196tm" /> I recommend these two authors to you
					instead of Livy and Quintilian.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.197tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Palgrave, I suppose, you have by this time seen and sifted; if not, I must tell you, his letter was dated from Glamis, 30th Sept.,
					Tuesday night. He was that day returned from my tour in the Highlands, delighted with their beauties, though he saw the Alps last year.
					The Friday following he was to set out for Hetton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.198tm" /> where his stay would not be long; then pass four
					days at Newby,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.199tm" /> and as much at York, and so to Cambridge, where, ten to one, he has not yet arrived.
						Tom<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.200tm" /> outstripped Lord Panmure<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.201tm" /> at the county court at Forfar all to
					nothing. Dr. Richmond<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.202tm" /> is body chaplain to the Duke of Athol, lives at Dunkeld,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.203tm" /> and eats muir-fowls' livers every day. If you know this already, who can help it?</p>

					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Do not think, I forget you all this time: nothing less! I have daily thought on you, tho' to little purpose. perhaps the sense of my
					own inutility has been the reason of my silence, it is certain I have been well enough, &amp; enough alone for the 7 or 8 weeks that I
					have pass'd here, the last three of them indeed (during this dreadful weather) I have been nursing Mr Brown, who has been under the
					Surgeon's hands, &amp; now just begins to go across the room. the moral of this is, that when you break your shin, you should not put
					the black sticking-plaister to it, wch has been the cause of our sufferings; &amp; thus at other people's expence we become wise, &amp;
					thank heaven, that it is not at our own. </p>
				<p>I have often wish'd to talk to Dr H:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.214tm" /> about you, but have been restrain'd by the fear, that my
					interposition, like your friend Dr M:s,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.214tm2" /> might do more hurt than good. in the mean time I do suspect a
					little, that our acquaintance at Nice<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.214tm1" /> is by no means so near his end, as all good Christians might
					wish. my reasons are twofold. First, because I do not remember ever to have read in any news-paper that Lady Betty Beelzebub or Master
					Moloch, or even old Sr Satan himself, or any of the good family, were dead:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.215tm" /> therefore I may be allow'd
					to doubt a little of their mortality. Secondly, is it not very possible, that he may think, his Substitute<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.216tm" /> here will not so readily go on without rising in his terms; nor do his drudgery so patiently, unless he
					thought him likely soon to return? and as he has no such intention, what else can he do, but make himself worse than he is, &amp; order
					his Nurse to write melancholy accounts of him to her friends here?</p>
				<p>Had it not been for this ill-contrived notion of mine,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.217tm" /> I should have been glad to hear my<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.218tm" /> Uncles were off their bargain.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.219tm" /> it is sure, that the situation you mention
					is reckon'd as good as any part of the county. I, who lately was in the county,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.220tm" /> know, that this is not
					saying a vast deal. but however<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.221tm" /> now I wish it had succeeded. this at least we seem to learn from it,
					that they are in earnest, wch is the great point: and I hope you have not been wanting in acknowledgements, nor shew'd the least
					sulkiness at seeing the negotiation drop, because the purchase was dear. I desire, you would give yourself no airs!</p>
				<p>The letter to your Father<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.222tm" /> was the very thing I meant to write to you about. if he is really dead, or
					dead to shame or humanity, it is no matter: a few words are lost. if he lives, who knows what may be the consequence? why are you not
					in orders yet, pray!<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.223tm" /> how have you pass'd this frightful piece of a winter? better I dare say, &amp;
					more comfortably than I. I have many <hi rend="italic">desagrémens,</hi> that surround me: they have not dignity enough to be called
						<hi rend="italic">misfortunes:</hi> but they feel heavy on my mind.</p>

				<p>Dr Swift says, one never should write to one's Friends but in high health &amp; spirits.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.225tm" /> by the way
					it is the last thing people in those circumstances usually think of doing: but it is sure, if I were to wait for them, I never should
					write at all. at present I have had for these six weeks a something growing in my throat, wch nothing does any service to, &amp; wch
					will, I suppose, in due time stop up the passage. I go however about, &amp; the pain is very little. you will say perhaps, the malady
					is as little, &amp; the stoppage is in the imagination. no matter for that! if it is not sufficient to prove want of health (for indeed
					this is all I ail) it is so much the stronger proof of the want of spirits. so take it as you please, I carry my point, &amp; shew you,
					that it is very obliging in me to write at all. indeed perhaps on your account, I should not have done it: but after three such weeks
					of Lapland-weather I can not but enquire after Mrs Mason's health. if she has withstood such a winter &amp; her cough never the worse:
					she may defy the Doctors &amp; all their works. pray, tell me how she is, for I interest myself for her not merely on your account, but
					on her own. these three last mornings have been very vernal &amp; mild: has she tasted the air of the new year at least in
					Hyde-Park?</p>
				<p>Mr Brown will wait on her next week, &amp; touch her.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.226tm" /> he has been confined to lie on a couch, &amp;
					under the Surgeon's hands eversince the first of January with a broken shin ill-doctor'd. he is just now got abroad, &amp; obliged to
					come to Town about Monday on <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> business.</p>
				<p>Stonhewer was so kind as to tell me the mystery now accomplish'd, before I received your letter. I rejoice in all his
						accessions:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.227tm" /> I wish, you would persuade him to take unto him a Wife: but don't let her be a fine Lady.

				<p>No, alass, she has not withstood the Severity of the Weather. It nipt her as it would have done a flower half witherd before, &amp;
					she has been this last month in a most weak condition. Yet this present fine season has enabled me to get her three or four times out

					<salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>It grieves me to hear the bad account you give of our poor Patient's health. I will not trouble you to enquire into the opinions of
					her Physicians: as you are silent on that head, I doubt you are grown weary of the inutility of their applications. I (you will
					remember) am at a distance, &amp; can not judge (but by conjecture) of the progress her disorder seems to make, &amp; particularly of
					that increasing weakness, wch seems indeed an alarming symptom. I am told, that the sea-air is advised as likely to be beneficial,
					&amp; that Ld H: offers you the use of Walmer-Castle,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.235tm" /> but that you wait till the spring is more
					advanced to put this in execution. I think, I should by no means delay at all. the air of the coast is at all seasons warmer, than that
					of the inland-country: the weather is now mild &amp; open, &amp; (unless the rains increase) fit for travelling. remember, how well she
					bore the journey to London; &amp; it is certain, that sort of motion in her case instead of fatigue often brings an accession of
					strength. I have lately seen that coast,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.236tm" /> &amp; been in Deal-Castle, wch is very similar in situation
					to Walmer &amp; many other little neighbouring forts. no doubt, you may be very well lodged &amp; accommodated there: the scene is
					delightful in fine weather, but in a stormy day &amp; high wind (and we are but just got so far in the year as the middle of February)
					exposed to all the rage of the sea, &amp; full force of the East: so that to a Person unused to the sea, it may be even dreadful. my
					idea therefore is, that you might go at present to Ramsgate, wch is shelter'd from the North, &amp; opening only to S: &amp; S:E:, with
					a very fine pier to walk on.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.237tm" /> it is a neat Town, seemingly with very clean houses to lodge in, &amp;
					one end of it only running down to the shore. it is at no season much pester'd with company, &amp; at present I suppose there is no
					body there. if you find Mrs Mason the better for this air &amp; situation (wch God send) when May &amp; fine settled weather come in,
					you will easily remove to Walmer, wch at that season will be delightful to her. if&#x2013;forgive me for supposing the worst: your
					letter leaves me too much reason to do so, tho' I hope it was only the effect of a melancholy imagination. if it should be necessary to
					meet the spring in a milder climate than ours is: you are very near Dover, &amp; perhaps this expedient (if she grow very visibly
					worse) may be preferable to all others, &amp; ought not to be defer'd. it is usually too long delay'd.</p>
				<p>There are a few words in your letter, that make me believe, you wish I were in Town. I know myself, how little one like me is form'd
					to support the spirits of another, or give him consolation: one that always sees things in their most gloomy aspect. however be
					assured, I should not have left London while you were in it, if I could well have afforded to stay there till the beginning of April,
					when I am usually there. this however shall be no hindrance, if you tell me, it would signify any thing to you, that I should come
					sooner.</p>

				<p>How do you do, good Mr. Brown? Do your inclinations begin to draw northward, as mine do, and may I take you a place soon? I wait but
					for an answer from Mason how to regulate our journey, which I should hope may take place in a little more than a week. I shall write a
					line again to settle the exact day, but you may now tell me whether you will come to town, or be taken up at Buckden,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.265tm" /> or thirdly, whether you will go in a chaise with me by short journeys, and see places in our way. I dined
					yesterday on Richmond Hill, after seeing Chiswick,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.266tm" /> and Strawberry, and Sion;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.267tm" /> and be assured the face of the country looks an emerald, if you love jewels.</p>
				<p>The Westminster Theatre<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.268tm" /> is like to come to a sudden end. The manager<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.269tm"

						xml:id="id_tg3a.272tm" /> and added so much strength to the opposition, that they came within six of the majority. He did not vote,
					however, though his two brothers did, and, like good boys, with the ministry. For this he has been rattled on both sides of his ears,
					and forbid to appear there any more.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.273tm" /> The Houses wait with impatience the conclusion of the East India
						business<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.274tm" /> to rise. The E. of Chatham is mending slowly in his health, but sees nobody on business yet,

				<p> I have seen his lordship of Cloyne<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.276tm" /> often. He is very jolly, and we devoured four raspberry-puffs
					together in Cranbournalley<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.277tm" /> standing at a pastrycook's shop in the street; but he is gone, and Heaven
					knows when we shall eat any more.</p>
				<p>Rousseau you see is gone too. I read his letter to my Lord Chancellor from Spalding, and hear he has written another long one to Mr.
					Conway from Dover, begging he might no longer be detained here.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.278tm" /> He retains his pension.<anchor

					drakes in the Minikin.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.318tm" /> You will say I need not, I have only to teach Dr Wharton how to make them.
					Perhaps my metaphor was not well chosen, tis however as good as yours where you say Old Park must die a maid if I dont come &amp; lay
					her <hi rend="italic">out.</hi> When Mr Hurd comes to publish our correspondence I know what will be his Note upon this passage, "To
					have made the allusion appear with due congruity the Poet should have written lay her <hi rend="italic">down</hi> for to lay her <hi
						rend="italic">out</hi> supposes her to be already dead wch the premises inform us this old Maid was not, &amp; therefore only wanted
					to be <hi rend="italic">laid down.</hi> As the Passage now stands there is an impropriety in it wch evn the freedom of the Epistolary
					mode of writing will not Justify." Take another Note from Dr Balguy: "There are two Vernacular Phrases wch we apply seperately, &amp;
					wch indeed will not admit of a reciprocal usage in our tongue. the one we apply constantly where any thing is predicated concerning
					Gardening &amp; the other we as constantly use as a term in Agriculture. Thus we lay <hi rend="italic">out</hi> pleasure Grounds but we
					lay <hi rend="italic">down</hi> feild Lands. Now had the writer deliverd the above sentiment without a figure he would have simply said
					Old Park wants to be <hi rend="italic">laid out,</hi> &amp; here as Old Park means a pleasure ground or Garden, the Phrase would have
					been just &amp; pertinent. But he chose to personify Old park &amp; to speak of her under the figure of an Old Maid, &amp; hence arose
					the incongruity which the Critic has so justly stigmatizd, &amp; wch would not have appeard so had Old Park been a common feild; but
					unhappily for the writer, Old Park was (as we have seen) a pleasure ground, or garden and as such requird to be <hi rend="italic">laid
						out</hi> not to be <hi rend="italic">laid down,</hi> hence it would not admit of the Metaphor in quæstion, &amp; I know no way of
					reducing this passage into the rules of <hi rend="italic">chast</hi> Composition but by supposing Old Park <hi rend="italic"
						>arable;</hi> then the figure will be in its place, &amp; the <hi rend="italic">Maid</hi> will be <hi rend="italic">laid down</hi> in
					a <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> &amp; even <hi rend="italic">elegant</hi> manner."</p>
				<p>Explicit Nonsense&#x2013;&amp; now what remains must be serious. I dined lately at Bishopthorpe<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.319tm" /> when

					page, if it either is, or can be made a decent thing assist me with your Judgment immediatly, for what I do about it I would do
					quickly, &amp; I can do nothing neither, if this will not do with correction. It cannot be expected, neither would I wish it, to be

				<p>I come forthwith to the epitaph, wch you have had the charity to write at the A:p's request. it will certainly do (for it is both
					touching &amp; new) but yet will require much finishing. I like not the three first lines: it is the Party most nearly concern'd, at
					least some one closely connected, &amp; bearing a part in the loss, that is usually supposed to speak on these occasions: but these
					lines appear to be written by the Chaplain, &amp; have an air of flattery to his Patron. all that is good in them is better expressed
					in the four last verses. <hi rend="italic">Where the cold ashes</hi> &amp;c: these five verses are well, except the word <hi
						rend="italic">benignant,</hi> &amp; the thought (wch is not clear to me, besides that it is somewhat <hi rend="italic">hardly</hi>
					express'd) of <hi rend="italic">When Beauty only blooms</hi> &amp;c: in gems, that want colour &amp; perfection, a <hi rend="italic"
						>foil</hi> is put under them to add to their lustre: in others, as in diamonds, the foil is black; &amp; in this sense when a pretty
					Woman chuses to appear in publick with a homely one, we say she uses her <hi rend="italic">as a foil.</hi> this puzzles me, as you
					neither mean, that Beauty sets off Virtue by its contrast &amp; opposition to it: nor that her Virtue was so imperfect, as to stand in
					need of Beauty to heighten its lustre. for the rest I read, <hi rend="italic">That sweetest harmony of soul</hi> &amp;c: <hi
						rend="italic">Such was the Maid,</hi> &amp;c: all this to the end I much approve, except&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">crown'd with
						truth,</hi> and lightens <hi rend="italic">all their load.</hi> the first is not precise; in the latter you say too much. <hi
						rend="italic">Spreads his child</hi> too is not the word. when you have corrected all these faults, it will be excellent.<anchor

				<p>I thank you for your Comments on my inaccurate metaphor. in return I will be sure to shew them to the Parties,<anchor

					<salute>Dear Mr Gray </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>In hopes this may catch you before you set off for Hartlepool I answer yours the moment I receive it (Minster Vespers only
					intervening) The Dean<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.341tm" /> has disapointed me &amp; is not yet arrivd, the Robinsons<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.342tm" /> I expect every hour. in the meanwhile I will resume the subject of the Epitaph.</p>
				<p>Had you given me any hint any <hi rend="italic">Lueur</hi> how the three first lines might have been alterd, it would have been
					charitable indeed. But you say nothing, only that I must alter them, Now in my Conscience to wch you appeal I cannot find fault with
					the Sentiment wch they contain, &amp; yet in dispite of my Conscience if I thought that they implyd the least shadow of flattery to the
					ABp I would wipe them out with a spunge dipt in the mud of the kennel. But I cannot think they do. I think on the contrary they give
					the Composition that Unity of Thought wch ought always to run thro compositions of this kind, for in my mind <hi rend="italic">a
						Perfect Epitaph is a Perfect Epigram without a sting.</hi> NB this sentence in our Epistolæ Familiares cum notis variorum will be
					explaind, in a Note of Dr Balguys, to the contentation of every reader; in the meantime if you dont understand it yourself, console
					yourself with the pleasing Idea that Posterity will, &amp; that is enough in reason.</p>
				<p>However to shew you my Complacency, &amp; in dread that you should ever do as you threaten, &amp; call whatever I send you the most
					perfect things in Nature, I will sacrifice the first Stanza on Your Critical Altar. &amp; let it consume either in flame or <hi
						rend="italic">Smudge</hi> as it chuses. Then we begin, <hi rend="italic">Here sleeps</hi> a very poetical sort of <hi rend="italic">Ci
						git,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">here lies,</hi> &amp; wch I hope will not lead the reader to imagine a sentence lost.</p>
				<q>
					<p>1 Here sleeps what once was Beauty once was Grace<lb /> 2 Grace that with native Sentiment combind<lb /> 3 To form that Harmony of
						Soul &amp; face<lb /> 4 Where Beauty shines the mirror of the mind<lb /> 5 Such was the Maid that in the noon of youth,<lb /> 6 In
						Virgin innocence in natures pride<lb /> 7 Blest with each Art that taste supplies or Truth<lb /> 8 Sunk in her Fathers fond embrace
						&amp; died<lb /> 9 He weeps O venerate the holy tear<lb /> 10 Faith lends her aid to ease afflictions Load<lb /> 11 The Parent mourns
						his child upon her bier<lb /> 12 The Christian yeilds an Angel to his God.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.343tm" />
					</p>
				</q>
				<p>Various Lections, pick, &amp; chuse, <lb /> 2 <hi rend="italic">inborn</hi> sentiment.<lb /> 3 <hi rend="italic">displayd</hi> or <hi
						rend="italic">diffusd</hi> that Harmony &amp;c.<lb /> 7 that <hi rend="italic">springs</hi> from taste or Truth <hi rend="italic"
						>derivd</hi> from taste or Truth, that <hi rend="italic">charms</hi> with taste &amp; Truth. But, after all I dont know that she was a
					Metaphysician Blest with each art <hi rend="italic">that owes its charms</hi> to Truth wch Painting does as well as Logic &amp;
					Metaphysics.<lb /> 10 Faith lends her lenient aid to Sorrows Load. Faith lends her Aid &amp; <hi rend="italic">eases</hi> or <hi
						rend="italic">lightens</hi> Sorrows Load<lb /> 11 Pensive he <hi rend="italic">mourns</hi> or he <hi rend="italic">views</hi> or <hi
						rend="italic">Gives</hi>
					<lb /> 12 <hi rend="italic">Yet humbly yeilds</hi> or <hi rend="italic">But</hi> humbly</p>
				<p>Now if from all this you can pick out 12 Ostensible Lines, do, &amp; Ill father them, or if you will out of that Lukewarm corner of
					your heart where you hoard up your poetical Charity, throw out a poor mite to my distresses, I shall take it kind indeed. But if not,
					Stat prior Sententia, for I will give myself no further trouble about it. I cannot in this uncomfortable place where my Opus Magnum
					sive didacticum<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.344tm" /> has not advancd ten lines since I saw you.</p>
				<p>God bless Dr Wharton &amp; send him (for his Sympathy) never to feel what I feel. I will come to him the moment I can; write be sure
					you [do] when you return from your longer tour. But I hope to have an answer to this before you set out, because I shall not give the
					ABp any detirminate answer about the matter till I hear again from you. The Robinsons are just arrivd. </p>

				<p>I have been at Hartlepool like any thing, &amp; since that visiting about (wch is the ruin of all my country-expeditions) so that I

					<salute>Sr </salute>

				<p>I received from Mr Williamson<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.355tm" /> that very obliging mark you were pleased to give me of your
					remembrance. had I not entertain'd some slight hopes of revisiting Scotland this summer, &amp; consequently of seeing you at Aberdeen,
					I had sooner acknowledged by letter the favor you have done me. those hopes are now at an end: but I do not therefore despair of seeing
					again a country, that has given me so much pleasure; nor of telling you in person how much I esteem you, &amp; (as you chuse to call
					them) your <hi rend="italic">amusements.</hi> the specimen<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.356tm" /> of them, wch you were so good to send me, I
					think excellent. the sentiments are such as a melancholy imagination naturally suggests in solitude &amp; silence, &amp; that (tho'
					light &amp; business may suspend or banish them at times) return with but so much the greater force upon a feeling heart. the diction
					is elegant &amp; unconstrain'd, not loaded with epithets &amp; figures, nor flagging into prose. the versification is easy &amp;
					harmonious. my only objection is to the first part of this line <q>
						<p>
							<hi rend="italic">Perfumed with fresh fragrance</hi> &amp;c:</p>
					</q> where the consonants are harsh &amp; frequent, tho' the image is good &amp; the words in all other respects well chosen. a
						Friend<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.357tm" /> of mine, to whom I shew'd these verses, rather blames the choice of your measure, as
					appropriated to comic, or at most to pastoral subjects: but I do not think his criticism of much weight. you see, Sr, I take the
					liberty you indulged me in, when I first saw you, &amp; therefore I make no excuses for it, but desire you would take your revenge on
					me in kind. </p>
				<p>I have read over (but too hastily) Mr Ferguson's book.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.358tm" /> there are uncommon strains of eloquence in
					it, &amp; I was surprised to find not one single idiom of his country (I think) in the whole work. he has not the fault you mention:
					his application to the heart is frequent, &amp; often successful. his love of Montesquiou &amp; Tacitus has led him into a manner of
					writing too short-winded &amp; sententious, wch those great Men had they lived in better times &amp; under a better government would
					have avoided.</p>
				<p>I know no pretence, that I have, to the honor Lord Gray is pleased to do me:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.359tm" /> but if his Ldp chuses
					to own me, it certainly is not my business to deny it. I say not this merely on account of his quality: but because he is a very worthy
					&amp; accomplish'd Person. I am truly sorry for the great loss<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.360tm" /> he has had, since I left Scotland. if
					you should chance to see him, I will beg you to present my respectful humble service to his Lordship.</p>
				<p>I gave Mr Williamson all the information I was able in the short time he stay'd with me. he seem'd to answer well the character you
					gave me of him: but what I chiefly envied in him was his ability of walking all the way from Aberdeen to Cambridge, &amp; back again,
					wch if I possess'd, you would soon see </p>

				<p>I admire you as the pink of perversity.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.362tm" /> how did I know about York-Races? &amp; how could I be more
					explicit about our journey. the truth is, I was only too explicit by half, for we did not set out in earnest till the 29th of August,
					being delay'd partly by the bad weather, &amp; partly by your Cousin my Lord Perrot,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.363tm" /> &amp; his
					assizes, whose train we were afraid to overtake, &amp; still more afraid of being overtaken by it. at last then we went in the sun
					&amp; dust broiling to Newcastle, &amp; so by the military road to Hexham at night, where it begun to rain, &amp; continued like fury
					(with very short intervals) all the rest of our way. so we got to Carlisle, pass'd a day there in raining &amp; seeing delights. next
					day got to Penrith (more delights) the next dined &amp; lay at Keswick, could not go a mile to see anything. Dr Wh: taken ill in the
					night with an asthma. went on however over stupendous hills to Cockermouth: here the Dr grew still worse in the night, so we came
					peppering (&amp; raining) back thro Keswick to Penrith. next day lay at Brough,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.364tm" /> grew better (raining
					still) &amp; so over Stanemoor<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.365tm" /> home, Sept: 5, in a heavy thunder-shower. now you will think from this
					detail, wch is litterally true, that we had better have staid at home. no such thing! I am charm'd with my journey, &amp; the Dr dreams
					of nothing but Skiddaw, &amp; both of us vow to go again the first opportunity. I carried Mr Brown to Gibside<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.366tm" /> the 11th of Aug: &amp; took a receipt for him: they did not set out for Scotland till the 1st of September,
					&amp; as yet I have not heard from him.</p>
				<p>If you are not too much afflicted for the loss of Charles Townshend,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.367tm" /> now is your time to come &amp;
					see us. in spite of your coquetry we still wish of all things to see you, &amp; (bating that vice, &amp; a few more little faults) have

					meant as an insult upon the real poor. how dare you practise this upon me? don't I know little Clough!<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.368tm" />

				<p>You have indeed brought yourself into a little scrape. I would, if it were my own case, say to Ld L: (supposing you were pressed by
					him) that I had not received yet any letter from T:;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.391tm" /> in the mean time I would write instantly to him
					in Devonshire, tell him my difficulty, &amp; how I got into it, &amp; desire his consent to shew Ld L: so much of his letter, as might
					be proper. I would then (supposing him not averse) have a cold or the tooth-ach, &amp; be detain'd at Richmond,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.392tm" /> from whence I would (transcribing so much of this very letter as may be fit for his Ldp to see) send it to
					him in Town, as the substance of what I had <hi rend="italic">just then</hi> received in answer to my own. he will have suspicions (you
					will say) from my not shewing him the original. no matter! you are nothing to Ld L:; perhaps you had written to T: about other affairs,
					that you can not shew him; he will not be so uncivil as to ask for it; in short let him suspect, what he pleases: any thing is better,
					than to shew it him. and yet I would omitt nothing in my copy but what relates to <hi rend="italic">Berwick</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.393tm" /> and to <hi rend="italic">the addition</hi> that he should have made to the parsonage-house.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.394tm" /> the kindness express'd for him toward the latter part of the letter will (if he cares for T:) make up for
					all the rest.</p>
				<p>By the way T: does himself much credit with me by this letter, &amp; I did not (begging his pardon) suspect him of writing so well.
					but yet I must stand up a little for Ld L:. what occasion pray for so many cordial letters (wch, if he were good for nothing at bottom,
					must have cost him some pains of head) &amp; for the bribe of a living, only to gain T:s vote &amp; interest, wch as a Relation &amp;
					Friend he would have had for nothing at all. is not the date he sets to the beginning of Ld L:s coldness to him carried a little too
					far back? did it not really begin a little later, when he had brought his wife to Mamhead, &amp; they did not much like her? these
					indeed are only conjectures, but they may be true. I have to be sure a little prejudice to Madam; but yet I must be candid enough to
					own that the parsonage-house sticks a little in my stomach. </p>
				<p>My best remembrances to Temple, &amp; tell him, I wish, he would not give too much way to his own sensibilities; &amp; still less (in
					this case) to the sensibilities of <hi rend="italic">other People.</hi> it is always time enough to quarrel with one's Friends.</p>

					Cambridge, I take up my pen to thank you for your very friendly offers, wch have so much the air of frankness &amp; real good-meaning,
					that were my body as tractable &amp; easy of conveyance as my mind, you would see me tomorrow in the chamber you have so hospitably
					laid out for me at Aberdeen. but, alas! I am a summer-bird, &amp; can only sit drooping, till the sun returns: even then too my wings
					may chance to be clipp'd, &amp; little in plight for so distant an excursion.</p>
				<p>The proposal you make me about printing, what little I have ever written, at Glasgow does me honour. I leave my reputation in that
					part of the kingdom to your care, &amp; only desire you would not let your partiality to me &amp; mine mislead you. if you persist in
					your design, Mr Foulis<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.398tm" /> certainly ought to be acquainted of what I am now going to tell you. when I was
					in London the last spring, Dodsley the Bookseller ask'd my leave to reprint, in a smaller form all I have ever publish'd, to wch I
					consented; &amp; added, that I would send him a few explanatory notes, &amp; if he would omitt entirely the <hi rend="italic">Long
						Story</hi> (wch was never meant for the publick, &amp; only suffer'd to appear in that pompous edition because of Mr Bentley's
					designs, wch were not intelligible without it) I promised to send him some thing else to print instead of it, least the bulk of so
					small a volume should be reduced to nothing at all. now it is very certain, that I had rather see them printed at Glasgow (especially
					as you will condescend to revise the press) than at London, but I know not how to retract my promise to Dodsley. by the way you perhaps
					may imagine, that I have some kind of interest in this publication: but the truth is, I have none whatever. the expence is his &amp; so
					is the profit, if there<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.399tm" /> be any. I therefore told him the other day in general terms, that I heard,
					there would be an edition put out in Scotland by a friend of mine, whom I could not refuse, &amp; that if so, I would send thither a
					copy of the same notes &amp; additions, that I had promised to send to him. this did not seem at all to cool his courage; Mr Foulis
					therefore must judge for himself, whether he thinks it worth while to print, what is going to be printed also at London. if he does I
					will send him (in a packet<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.400tm" /> to you) the same things I shall send to Dodsley.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.401tm" /> they are imitations of two pieces of old Norwegian poetry, in wch there was a wild spirit, that struck me:
					but for my paraphrases I can not say much. you will judge. the rest are nothing but a few parallel passages; &amp; small notes just to
					explain, what People said at the time was wrap'd in total darkness. you will please to tell me, as soon as you can conveniently, what
					Mr F:s says on this head,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.402tm" /> that (if he drops the design) I may save myself &amp; you the trouble of
					this packet. I ask your pardon for talking so long about it: a little more &amp; my letter would be as big as all <hi rend="italic">my
						works.</hi>
				</p>
				<p>I have read with much pleasure an Ode<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.403tm" /> of yours (in wch you have done me the honour to adopt a
					measure, that I have used) on Ld Hay's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.404tm" /> birth-day. tho' I do not love <hi rend="italic"
						>panegyrick,</hi> I can not but applaud this, for there is nothing mean in it. the diction is easy &amp; noble. the texture of the
					thoughts lyrick, &amp; the versification harmonious. the fourth Stanza<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.405tm" /> is particularly my favourite
						(<hi rend="italic">the Muse with joy</hi> &amp;c:) for the contrast of images; &amp; the three follo[wing]<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.406tm2" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.406tm1" /> are excellent: not so the last. it is rather sp[un out]<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.406tm" /> &amp; the
					thoughts repeated. I object a little too to (in St: 2d) <hi rend="italic">All energy of mind.</hi> the word <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
					weakens the verse; &amp; again in St: 6, <hi rend="italic">O yet e'er Luxury.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.407tm" /> that word can not be contracted to a dissyllable without harshness, tho' <hi rend="italic"
						>Mem'ry</hi> may. these indeed are Minutiæ, but they weigh for something, as half a grain makes a difference in the value of a
					diamond.</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Many &amp; various maladies have I labour'd under, since I left the north, but none of them (thanks to my summer expedition) <hi
						rend="italic">jusqu' a mourir.</hi> the gout came regularly, while I was in town, first in one, then in the other foot, but so
						tame<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.415tm" /> you might have stroked it. since I got hither, <hi rend="italic">another</hi> of my troublesome
					companions for life has confined me to my room, but abstinence has (I believe) got the better of that too, &amp; to-morrow I go abroad
					again. I sent to your brother,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.416tm" /> before I left London, the <hi rend="italic">maps</hi> you wanted, the
						<hi rend="italic">Decouvertes des Russes,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.417tm" />

					your end. that of <hi rend="italic">Birds</hi> is indeed in English, but not to be had in the shops &amp; sells at auctions from 30 to
					40 shillings, so I did not buy it without farther orders. I hope this cargo is safe arrived; &amp; another little one, that I sent to
					Miss Wharton &amp; Miss Peggy, directed to the former, to be left at Mr Tho: Wilkinson's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.424tm" /> in Durham:
					this went by the Newcastle Waggon about 6th of Dec:, &amp; contain'd twelve Flower-roots, viz: 3 Soleil d'or Narcissus, 2 White Italian
					d°: (N:B: of the Double white &amp; yellow Italian there are none to be had this year) 2 Pileus Cardinalis, red; 1 Kroon-vogel, 1
					Degeraad, double White; 1 Belle Grisdelin. 1 Hermaphrodite, &amp; 1 Incomparable, double blew; Hyacinths. for these you must get
					glasses from Newcastle. in the same box was a pocket Lens, wch Miss Wh:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.425tm" /> (if she pleased) was to give
					to Aunt Middleton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.426tm" /> who wanted such a thing.</p>
				<p>I desire to know, what you thought of Mason's plan<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.427tm" /> for your ground (wch makes so pretty a figure on

					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.428tm" /> came to Old-Park to advise about planting. he is a very intelligent modest young Man, &amp; might be
					of great use there. has Miss Wh: served her time yet as a Bride-maid? I hope it may prove a good omen to her! does Miss Peggy<anchor

						Dicky<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.434tm" /> kick up his heels, &amp; study Geography? please to answer me as to all these particulars. my
					Thermometer presents her compliments to her country-sister, &amp; proposes now to open a correspondence with her. she lives against a
					pale in the garden with her back to the East at 9 o'clock in the morning precisely: at any other hour she is not visible, unless upon
					some great occasion. I was in London from 3 Nov: to 14 Dec:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.435tm" /> during wch time the weather was commonly
					open, damp, &amp; mild, with the wind in the West, veering either to N: or S:. on the last mention'd day I found some Brambles &amp;
					Feverfew yet flowering in the hedges, &amp; in gardens the double Chrysanthemum, double Chamomile, Borage, Stocks, &amp; single
					Wall-flowers. these were all cut off on the 24th by an E: wind &amp; hard frost, Therm: at 31. next day &amp; today it was at 30. on
					the 26th a little snow fell, wch still lies &amp; freezes.</p>
				<p>Our Ministry<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.436tm" /> has taken in some odd Coadjutors not much to its credit or strength. it appear'd from
					the first day the Parliament met, that the Opposition were all to pieces among themselves, &amp; soon after the Duke of Bedf:d civilly
					declared to Mr Grenville, that he had the highest opinion of his abilities: but as it was contrary to his principles to keep up a
					constant opposition to the K:s measures, he must not wonder, if his Friends should drop the plan they had for sometime been pursuing.
					accordingly he made his terms, four or five of them were directly to be provided for: the rest were to wait till there was room.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.437tm" /> Ld Shelburne<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.438tm" /> (the Sec:y), &amp; Mr Cook<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.439tm" />

						retires,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.440tm" /> &amp; is to have the army, when Ld Ligonier dies: this is voluntary, I imagine. Ld

						Gower<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.443tm" /> supply their places, Mr Thynne<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.444tm" /> is Master of ye Houshold. Ld

					of State for America) Rigby<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.447tm" /> is the other, that must come in (to what place I know not) &amp; conduct,
					I suppose, the House of Commons. how much better &amp; nobler would it have been to have left all these Beggars in the lurch? indeed
					what could be said against it, as all that could oppose the Ministry were already broke into three parts,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.448tm"
					 /> &amp; one of them<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.449tm" /> had declared publickly against the other two? I conclude the Rockingham-party

					<salute>Dear Nicholls </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Write by all means forthwith to Ld L:,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.454tm" /> give a little into his way of thinking, seem to fear you have
					gone a little too far in communicating so much of T:s letter, wch was not intended for his eye; but say you thought, you saw at bottom
					so much of respect &amp; affection for him, that you had the less scruple to lay open the weaknesses &amp; little suspicions of a
					Friend, that (you know beyond a doubt) very gratefully &amp; sincerely loves him. remind him <anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.455tm2" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.455tm1" />
					<hi rend="italic">eloquently</hi> (that is, from your heart, &amp; in such expressions as that will furnish)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.455tm" /> how many idle suspicions a sensible mind, naturally disposed to melancholy, &amp; depress'd by misfortune,
					is capable of entertaining, especially if it meets with but a shadow of neglect or contempt from the very (perhaps the only) person, in
					whose kindness it had taken refuge. remind him of his former goodness frankly &amp; generously shewn to T:, &amp; beg him not to
					destroy the natural effects of it by any appearance of pique or resentment, for that even the fancies &amp; chimæras of a worthy heart
					deserve a little management &amp; even respect. assure him, as I believe, you safely may, that a few kind words, the slightest
					testimony of his esteem will brush away all T:s suspicions &amp; gloomy thoughts &amp; that there will need after this no constraint on
					his own behaviour (no, not so much as to ring a bell)<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.456tm" /> for, when one is secure of people's intentions,
					all the rest passes for nothing.</p>
				<p>To this purpose (but in my own way) would I write, &amp; mighty respectfully withall. it will come well from you, &amp; you can say
					without consequence what in T: himself it would be mean to say. Ld L: is rather more piqued than needs, methinks. the truth is, the
					causes of this quarrel on paper do appear puerile, as to the matter; but the manner is all, &amp; that we do not see. I rather stick by
					my Ld still, &amp; am set against Madam Minx:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.457tm" /> yet (as I told you before) the <hi rend="italic"
						>house</hi> lies hard at my stomach.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.458tm" />
				</p>
				<p>There are many letters &amp; things, that I never saw, as that strange one in Wales,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.459tm" /> &amp; that to
					Lady Lisb:, now without these how can I judge? you have seen more of the matter, &amp; perhaps may be right: but as yet I do not
					believe it. what can that <hi rend="italic">firm &amp; spirited</hi> letter be?<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.460tm" /> I fear it will make
					matters worse, &amp; yet it was sent away before he had seen T:s letter to you. if he had, it would have made it worse still.</p>
				<p>You ask, if you should copy Ld L:s, and send it to T:. I think, rather not. he has now had one from him himself. if you are obliged
					to do so, it should be only the sense of it, &amp; that abated &amp; mollified, especially all that tastes of contempt. </p>
				<p>Adieu! bless your stars, that you are snug in fat-goose living, without a Minx, &amp; without a Lord.</p>

				<p>You perceive by Mr Brown's letter, that I pass'd all the summer in the North of England, went from thence to London, &amp; did not
					arrive here till the middle of December, where I found your parcel.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.486tm" /> since that time I have been
					generally confined to my room, &amp; besides I was willing to go thro' the eight volumes<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.487tm" /> before I
					return'd you an answer. this must be my excuse to you, for only doing now, what in mere civility I ought to have done long ago. first I
					must condole with you, that so neat an edition should swarm in almost every page with errors of the press, not only in notes &amp;
					citations from Greek, French, &amp; English authors, but in the Italian text itself, greatly to the disreputation of the Leghorn
					Publishers. this is the only reason (I think) that could make an edition in England necessary:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.488tm" /> but I
					doubt you would not find the matter much mended here, our presses, as they improve in beauty, declining daily in accuracy: besides you
					would find the expence very considerable, &amp; the sale in no proportion to it, as in reality it is but few people in England, that
					read currently &amp; with pleasure the Italian tongue; &amp; the fine old editions of their capital Writers are sold at London for a
					lower price, than they bear in Italy. an English translation I can by no means advise. the justness of thought &amp; good sense might
					remain; but the graces of elocution (wch make a great part of Algarotti's merit) would be entirely lost, &amp; that merely from the
					very different genius &amp; complexion of the two languages. </p>
				<p>I rather think these volumes should be handsomely bound, before they are put into the Library: they bind very neatly here; &amp; if
					you approve it, Mr Brown will order it to be done.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.489tm" /> doubtless there can be no impropriety in making the
					same present to the University,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.490tm" /> nor need you at all to fear for the reputation of your Friend: he has
					merit enough to recommend him in any country, a tincture of various sorts of knowledge; an acquaintance with all the beautiful arts; an
					easy command, a precision, warmth, &amp; richness of expression; &amp; a judgement, that is rarely mistaken, on any subject to wch he
					applies it. of the Dialogues I have formerly told you my thoughts.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.491tm" /> the Essays and Letters (many of
					them entirely new to me) <hi rend="italic">on the Arts</hi> are curious &amp; entertaining. those on other subjects (even where the
					thoughts are not new to me, but borrowed from his various reading &amp; conversation) often better put, &amp; better express'd than in
					the originals. I rejoice, when I see Machiavel defended or illustrated, who to me appears one of the wisest Men, that any nation in any
					age has produced. most of the other discourses military or political are well worth reading, tho' that on Kouli-Khan was a mere Jeu
					d'esprit, a sort of historical exercise. the letters from Russia I had read before with pleasure, particularly the narrative of
						Munich<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.492tm" /> &amp; Lascy's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.493tm" /> campaigns. the detach'd thoughts are often new
					&amp; just; but there should have been a revisal of them, as they are often to be found in his letters repeated in the very same words.
					some too of the familiar letters might have been spared. The Congress of Cythera<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.494tm" /> I had seen, &amp;
					liked before, the <hi rend="italic">Giudicio d'Amore</hi> is an addition rather inferior to it. the verses are not equal to the prose,
					but they are above mediocrity.</p>
				<p>I shall be glad to hear your health is improved, &amp; that you have thoughts of favouring us with your company here.</p>

				<p> I and mine are safe, &amp; well, but the chambers opposite to me (Mr. Lyon's)<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.499tm" /> wch were getting

				<p>I am almost sorry to have raised any degree of impatience in you,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.517tm" /> because I can by no means satisfy
					it. the sole reason I have to publish these few additions<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.518tm" /> now is to make up (in bulk) for the omission
					of that <hi rend="italic">long story</hi>; &amp; as to the notes, I do it out of spite, because the Publick did not understand the two
					odes (wch I have call'd Pindaric) tho' the first was not very dark, &amp; the second alluded to a few common facts to be found in any
					six-penny History of England by way of question &amp; answer for the use of children. the parallel passages I insert out of justice to
					those writers, from whom I happen'd to take the hint of any line, as far as I can recollect.</p>
				<p>I rejoice to be in the hands of Mr Foulis, who has the laudable ambition of surpassing his Predecessors, the <hi rend="italic"
						>Etiennes,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.519tm" /> &amp; the <hi rend="italic">Elzeviers</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.520tm" /> as well in literature, as in the proper art of his profession. he surprises me in mentioning Miss
						Hepburne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.521tm" /> after whom I have been enquiring these fourteen years in vain. when the two odes were first
					publish'd, I sent them to her: but as I was forced to direct them very much at random, probably they never came to her hands. when the
					present edition comes out, I beg of Mr Foulis to offer her a copy in my name (with my respects, &amp; grateful remembrances). he will
					send another to you, Sr, &amp; a third to Ld Gray,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.522tm" /> if he will do me the honour of accepting it. these
					are all the presents I pretend to make (for I would have it consider'd only as a new edition of an old book) after this if he pleases
					to send me one or two, I shall think myself obliged to him. I can not advise him to print a great number, especially as Dodsley has it
					in his power to print as many as he pleases, tho' I desire him not to do so.</p>
				<p>You are very good to me in taking this trouble upon you. all I can say is, that I shall be happy to return it in kind, whenever you

					<p>The Title (I would wish) should be only <hi rend="italic">Poems by Mr Gray</hi> without any mention of notes or additions. the size,
						&amp; disposition of the lines I must leave to Mr Foulis: if he thinks it should be in 4to,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.525tm" /> the two
						Odes printed at Str:y Hill are very well (as you say) as to the form &amp; type,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.526tm" /> but the paper is
						rather too thin &amp; transparent. I prescribed nothing to Dodsley, but it appear'd to me, that he meant to publish a smaller edition
						(&amp; consequently a cheaper)<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.527tm" /> than in 4to, but of this I am not certain. Mr F: will also determine,
						whether the few notes there are shall stand at the bottom of the page (wch is better for the Reader) or be thrown to the end with
						references (wch improves the beauty of the book).<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.528tm" /> the poems should stand (I think) in this order
						&amp; with these titles. <list>
							<item>1. Ode. Lo! where the rosy &amp;c: </item>

				<p>I intend to return you the letters<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.534tm" /> by tomorrow's Fly, if nothing hinders. I am never the wiser, nor
					the more able to account for T:s letter to Lady L:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.535tm" /> (wch gave occasion to all the rest) it still looks
					like the suggestion of his Wife working upon his own natural irritability, &amp; the sort of request made in it for the Berwick-living
					(at so improper a time) is not any other way to be accounted for. the <hi rend="italic">sensible &amp; manly</hi> answer<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.536tm" /> to it (I must own) I can not easily digest, especially the end of it: it is plain, as he wrote on, he work'd
					his temper into a ferment, till at last it absolutely turn'd sower. I can not help his temper, but his heart may (for all that) be
					right. in the second letter he is conscious, he had gone too far in his expressions, &amp; tries to give them a sense they will not
					bear: but I allow he is throughout too angry &amp; too contemptuous. your last letter to him (tho' I never saw it) I conclude has done
					no hurt, perhaps has softened him a little. every thing depends upon the manner of their meeting in Devonshire, wch by this time you
					probably know. I do not yet see, why all this passion, why all this trouble of justifying himself to a Man, for whom he never had any
					kindness or regard, &amp; who can be of little use to him in point of interest. Temp: is too precipitate, too rough too in his
					expressions, too much the aggressor, if he thinks Ld L: really his Friend; and if he does not, how in the midst of his resentment can
					he bring himself to shew a desire of accepting farther favours from him? I yet have some little hope, that all may come right again, at
					least right enough for our purpose; for I am more convinced of T:s contempt &amp; want of esteem for L:, than I am of L:s aversion, or
					neglect of T:.</p>
				<p>Mason is here with us, &amp; will stay (I should hope) some time: he is even going to hire a small house opposite to Peter-house, wch
					he can not inhabit till next winter. Mr. Hutton<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.537tm" /> being dead, he has now a landed estate, the income of

					<dateline>Feb. 14, 1768. Pembroke College. </dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>I received the book<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.548tm" /> you were so good to send me, and have read it again (indeed I could hardly be
					said to have read it before) with attention and with pleasure. Your second edition<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.549tm" /> is so rapid in its
					progress, that it will now hardly answer any purpose to tell you either my own objections, or those of other people. Certain it is,
					that you are universally read here; but what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> think, is not so easy to come at. We stay as usual to see the
					success, to learn the judgment of the town, to be directed in our opinions by those of more competent judges. If they like you, we
					shall; if any one of name write against you, we give you up: for we are modest and diffident of ourselves, and not without reason.
					History in particular is not our <hi rend="italic">fort</hi>; for (the truth is) we read only modern books and the pamphlets of the
					day. I have heard it objected, that you raise doubts and difficulties, and do not satisfy them by telling us what was <hi rend="italic"
						>really</hi> the case. I have heard you charged with disrespect to the king of Prussia;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.550tm" /> and above all
					to king William, and the revolution.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.551tm" /> These are seriously the most sensible things I have heard said,
					and all that I recollect. If you please to justify yourself, you may.</p>
				<p>My own objections are little more essential: they relate chiefly to inaccuracies of style, which either debase the expression or
					obscure the meaning. I could point out several small particulars of this kind, and will do so, if you think it can serve any purpose
					after publication. When I hear you read, they often escape me, partly because I am attending to the subject, and partly because from
					habit I understand you where a stranger might often be at a loss. </p>
				<p>As to your arguments, most of the principal parts are made out with a clearness and evidence that no one would expect where materials
					are so scarce. Yet I still suspect Richard of the murder of Henry VI. The chronicler of Croyland charges it full on him,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.552tm" /> though without a name or any mention of circumstances. The interests of Edward were the interests of Richard
					too, though the throne were not then in view; and that Henry still stood in their way, they might well imagine, because, though deposed
					and imprisoned once before, he had regained his liberty, and his crown; and was still adored by the people. I should think, from the
					word <hi rend="italic">tyranni,</hi> the passage was written after Richard had assumed the crown: but, if it was earlier, does not the
					bare imputation imply very early suspicions at least of Richard's bloody nature, especially in the mouth of a person that was no enemy
					to the house of York, nor friend to that of Beaufort? </p>
				<p>That the duchess of Burgundy, to try the temper of the nation, should set up a false pretender to the throne (when she had the true
					duke of York in her hands), and that the queen-mother (knowing her son was alive) should countenance that design,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.553tm" /> is a piece of policy utterly incomprehensible; being the most likely means to ruin their own scheme, and
					throw a just suspicion of fraud and falsehood on the cause of truth, which Henry could not fail to seize and turn to his own
					advantage.</p>
				<p>Mr. Hume's first query,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.554tm" /> as far as relates to the queen-mother, will still have some weight. Is it
					probable, she should give her eldest daughter to Henry, and invite him to claim the crown, unless she had been sure that her sons were
					then dead? As to her seeming consent to the match between Elizabeth and Richard, she and her daughters were in his power, which
					appeared now well fixed, his enemies' designs within the kingdom being every where defeated, and Henry unable to raise any considerable
					force abroad. She was timorous and hopeless; or she might dissemble, in order to cover her secret dealings with Richmond: and if this
					were the case, she hazarded little, supposing Richard to dissemble too, and never to have thought seriously of marrying his niece.</p>
				<p>Another unaccountable thing is, that Richard, a prince of the house of York, undoubtedly brave, clear-sighted, artful, attentive to
					business; of boundless generosity, as appears from his grants; just and merciful, as his laws and his pardons seem to testify; having
					subdued the queen and her hated faction, and been called first to the protectorship and then to the crown by the body of the nobility
					and by the parliament; with the common people to friend (as Carte<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.555tm" /> often asserts), and having nothing
					against him but the illegitimate family of his brother Edward, and the attainted house of Clarence (both of them within his
					power);&#x2013;that such a man should see within a few months Buckingham, his best friend, and almost all the southern and western
					counties on one day in arms against him; that, having seen all these insurrections come to nothing, he should march with a gallant army
					against a handful of needy adventurers, led by a fugitive, who had not the shadow of a title, nor any virtues to recommend him, nor any
					foreign strength to depend on; that he should be betrayed by almost all his troops, and fall a sacrifice;&#x2013;all this is to me
					utterly improbable, and I do not ever expect to see it accounted for. </p>
				<p>I take this opportunity to tell you, that Algarotti<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.556tm" /> (as I see in the new edition of his works
					printed at Leghorn)<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.557tm" /> being employed to buy pictures for the king of Poland,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.558tm" /> purchased among others the famous Holbein, that was at Venice. It don't appear that he knew any thing of
					your book: yet he calls it <hi rend="italic">the consul Meyer and his family,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.559tm" /> as if it were then known to be so in that city.</p>
				<p>A young man here, who is a diligent reader of books, an antiquary, and a painter,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.560tm" /> informs me, that
					at the Red-lion inn at Newmarket is a piece of tapestry containing the very design of your marriage of Henry the sixth,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.561tm" /> only with several more figures in it, both men and women; that he would have bought it of the people, but
					they refused to part with it.</p>
				<p>Mr. Mason, who is here, desires to present his respects to you. He says, that to efface from our annals the history of any tyrant is
					to do an essential injury to mankind: but he forgives it, because you have shown Henry the seventh to be a greater devil than Richard. </p>
				<p>Pray do not be out of humour. When you first commenced an author, you exposed yourself to pit, box and gallery. Any coxcomb in the
					world may come in and hiss, if he pleases; aye, and (what is almost as bad) clap too, and you cannot hinder him. I saw a little squib
					fired at you in a newspaper by some of the <hi rend="italic">house of York,</hi> for speaking lightly of chancellors.<anchor

					<salute> Dear Sir </salute>
				</opener>
				<p> I received Your most agreable packet<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.564tm" /> a week ago, and have carefully followed all Your instructions.
					I have written out all the Poems, in the order, and with the titles and mottos and notes, You desired. I never saw but one copy of
					Bentley's Edition, and that was a great many years ago: I was therefore obliged to transcribe the first second third and fourth Odes
					and the Elegy in a Country church yard from Dodsley's Collection.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.565tm" /> Such of the typographical errors as
					were obvious I have avoided; and I flatter myself that my Manuscript is pretty correct, for Your poems have been deeply imprinted on my
					memory for many years: however I shall recommend it to Foulis to compare the Manuscript with the folio Edition, if it can be got. The
					two Pindarick Odes I have taken from the Strawberry hill Edition.</p>
				<p> I have wrote out some Directions to the Printer concerning the size of the paper, page, and type;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.566tm" /> I
					have made choice of a fair and thick writing paper, and have proposed the Strawberry hill Edition as a pattern for the page and type. I
					have left it to M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Foulis to determine, whether the notes shall stand at the foot of each page, or at the end of
					the book; recommending however the latter,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.567tm" /> as being most consistent with elegance. In a word, I shall
					spare no pains to render our Scotch Edition in some measure worthy of the work, and of the Author.</p>
				<p> I think You have condescended to Your Readers inattention even more than was necessary: for my own part,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.568tm" /> I never found any difficulty in understanding Your poetry. The first of the Pindaric odes is so perspicuous,
					that I could hardly conceive it possible for any person of Common sense to misunderstand it. If there be any obscurity in <hi>the
						Bard</hi>, it is only in the allusions; for the style and imagery are clear distinct and strong. But readers now-a-days have nothing
					in view but amusement; and have little relish for a book that requires any degree of attention.</p>
				<p> Your new pieces have given me much pleasure: I could expatiate at great length on their beauties. The <hi>Fatal Sisters</hi>
					exhibits a collection of the most frightful images that ever occupied human imagination: some of them in the hands of an ordinary Poet
					would have sunk into burlesque (particularly the circumstance of the warriors heads) but You have made every thing magical and
					dreadful; Your choice of words on this, as on every other occasion, is the happiest that can be. It will (I am persuaded) give very
					high satisfaction to every Reader of taste, to observe with what exquisite art You have improved this fiction in Your <hi>Bard</hi>:
					the Norwegian witches excite horror; but the Welch bards do much more&#x2014;they transport, enrapture, alarm, astonish and confound
					us.&#x2014;The descent of Odin is not so interesting throughout, as the Sisters, but it abounds in exquisite images. The picture of the
					Dog of Darkness has no paralell in antient or modern poetry; I am convinced it owes more to the Imitator than to the Inventor. There
					are many other fine passages in the same poem, such as 'When long of yore to sleep &amp;c.'&#x2014;It is a pity we have no more of the
					Welch fragment; what You have given us is excellent, and has, I think, more method and perspicuity, than any other of the poems of that
					age.</p>
				<p> The Public will regret with me, that You have drop'd your design of writing a history of English poetry.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.569tm" /> Percy in his Dissertations on Antient Ballads has thrown out some hints on this subject; but much remains to
					be done; and I shall expect, from what you tell us, that a greater work will make its appearance in due time.</p>
				<p> I am much obliged to You for ordering a Copy of Your poems to be sent me when published: I will value it much for its own sake, but
					more for the sake of the Giver. But you owe me no thanks for what I have done in preparing this Edition; it was a most agreable
					amusement to me; and I think I have done my country a service and even an honour in being the first projector of so good a work.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.570tm" /></p>
				<p> I write by this Post to M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Foulis to let him know that the Manuscript is ready and will be sent by the first
					sure hand. None of Your instructions will be forgotten.</p>

				<p>You have sent me a long and very obliging letter,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.573tm" /> and yet I am extremely out of humour with you. I
					saw <hi rend="italic">poems</hi> by <hi rend="italic">Mr. Gray</hi> advertised:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.574tm" /> I called directly at
					Dodsley's to know if this was to be more than a new edition? He was not at home himself, but his foreman told me he thought there were
					some new pieces, and notes to the whole. It was very unkind, not only to go out of town without mentioning them to me, without showing
					them to me, but not to say a word of them in this letter. Do you think I am indifferent, or not curious, about what you write? I have
					ceased to ask you, because you have so long refused to show me any thing. You could not suppose I thought that you never write. No; but
					I concluded you did not intend, at least yet, to publish what you had written. As you did intend it, I might have expected a month's
					preference. You will do me the justice to own that I had always rather have seen your writings than have shown you mine; which you know
					are the most hasty trifles in the world, and which, though I may be fond of the subject when fresh, I constantly forget in a very short
					time after they are published. This would sound like affectation to others, but will not to you. It would be affected, even to you, to
					say I am indifferent to fame&#x2013;I certainly am not, but I am indifferent to almost any thing I have done to acquire it. The greater
					part are mere compilations; and no wonder they are, as you say, incorrect,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.575tm" /> when they are commonly
					written with people in the room, as Richard and the Noble Authors were. But I doubt there is a more intrinsic fault in them; which is,
					that I cannot correct them. If I write tolerably, it must be at once; I can neither mend nor add. The articles of lord Capel and lord
					Peterborough, in the second edition of the Noble Authors, cost me more trouble than all the rest together: and you may perceive that
					the worst part of Richard, in point of ease and style, is what relates to the papers you gave me on Jane Shore, because it was tacked
					on so long afterwards, and when my impetus was chilled. If some time or other you will take the trouble of pointing out the
					inaccuracies of it, I shall be much obliged to you: at present I shall meddle no more with it. It has taken its fate: nor did I mean to
					complain. I found it was condemned indeed beforehand, which was what I alluded to. Since publication (as has happened to me before) the
					success has gone beyond my expectation. </p>
				<p>Not only at Cambridge, but here, there have been people wise enough to think me too free with the king of Prussia!<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.576tm" /> A newspaper has talked of my known inveteracy to him.&#x2013;Truly, I love him as well as I do most kings.
					The greater offence is my reflection on lord Clarendon.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.577tm" /> It is forgotten that I had overpraised him
					before. Pray turn to the new State Papers,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.578tm" /> from which, <hi rend="italic">it is said,</hi> he composed
					his history. You will find they are the papers from which he did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> compose his history. And yet I admire my
					lord Clarendon more than these pretended admirers do. But I do not intend to justify myself. I can as little satisfy those who complain
					that I do not let them know what <hi rend="italic">really did</hi> happen. If this inquiry can ferret out any truth, I shall be glad. I
					have picked up a few more circumstances. I now want to know what Perkin Warbeck's proclamation was, which Speed in his history says is
					preserved by bishop Leslie.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.579tm" /> If you look in Speed, perhaps you will be able to assist me.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.580tm" />
				</p>
				<p>The duke of Richmond<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.581tm" /> and lord Lyttelton agree with you, that I have not disculpated Richard of the
					murder of Henry VI. I own to you, it is the crime of which in my own mind I believe him most guiltless. Had I thought he committed it,
					I should never have taken the trouble to apologize for the rest. I am not at all positive or obstinate on your other objections, nor
					know exactly what I believe on many points of this story. And I am so sincere, that, except a few notes hereafter, I shall leave the
					matter to be settled or discussed by others. As you have written much too little, I have written a great deal too much, and think only
					of finishing the two or three other things I have begun&#x2013; and of those, nothing but the last volume of painters is designed for
					the present public.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.582tm" /> What has one to do when turned [of] fifty,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.583tm" /> but
					really think of <hi rend="italic">finishing</hi>?</p>
				<p>I am much obliged and flattered by Mr. Mason's approbation, and particularly by having had almost the same thought with him. I said,
					'People need not be angry at my excusing Richard; I have not diminished their fund of hatred, I have only transferred it from Richard
					to Henry.'&#x2013;Well, but I have found you close with Mason&#x2013;No doubt, cry prating I, something will come out.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.584tm" /> &#x2013;Oh! no&#x2013;leave us, both of you, to Annabellas<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.585tm" /> and Epistles to
						Ferney,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.586tm" /> that give Voltaire an account of his own tragedies, to Macarony fables that are more
					unintelligible than Pilpay's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.587tm" /> are in the original, to Mr. Thornton's hurdy-gurdy poetry,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.588tm" /> and to Mr. &#x2014;, who has imitated himself worse than any fop in a magazine would have done.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.589tm" /> In truth, if you should abandon us, I could not wonder&#x2013;When Garrick's prologues and epilogues, his
					own Cymons<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.590tm" /> and farces, and the comedies of the fools that pay court to him, are the delight of the
					age, it does not deserve any thing better.</p>
				<p>Pray read the new account of Corsica.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.591tm" /> What relates to Paoli<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.592tm" /> will
					amuse you much. There is a deal about the island and its divisions that one does not care a straw for. The author, Boswell, is a
					strange being, and, like [&#x2014;],<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.593tm" /> has a rage of knowing any body that ever was talked of. He forced
					himself upon me at Paris<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.594tm" /> in spite of my teeth and my doors, and I see has given a foolish account of
					all he could pick up from me about King Theodore.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.595tm" /> He then took an antipathy to me on Rousseau's
					account, abused me in the newspapers, and exhorted Rousseau to do so too: but as he came to see me no more, I forgave all the rest. I
					see he now is a little sick of Rousseau himself, but I hope it will not cure him of his anger to me. However, his book will I am sure
					entertain you.</p>
				<p>I will add but a word or two more. I am criticized for the expression <hi rend="italic">tinker up</hi> in the preface.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.596tm" /> Is this one of those that you object to? I own I think such a low expression, placed to ridicule an absurd
					instance of wise folly, very forcible. Replace it with an elevated word or phrase, and to my conception it becomes as flat as possible. </p>
				<p>George Selwyn says I may, if I please, write historic doubts on the present duke of G&#x2014; too. Indeed, they would be doubts, for
					I know nothing certainly.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.597tm" />
				</p>
				<p>Will you be so kind as to look into Leslie de rebus Scotorum, and see if Perkin's proclamation is there, and if there, how
					authenticated? You will find in Speed my reason for asking this. </p>
				<p>I have written in such a hurry, I believe you will scarce be able to read my letter&#x2013;and as I have just been writing
						French,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.598tm" /> perhaps the sense may not be clearer than the writing.</p>

				<p>To your friendly accusation, I am glad I can plead not guilty with a safe conscience. Dodsley told me in the spring that the plates
					from Mr. Bentley's designs were worn out,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.600tm" /> and he wanted to have them copied and reduced to a smaller
					scale for a new edition. I dissuaded him from so silly an expense, and desired he would put in no ornaments at all. The <hi
						rend="italic">Long Story</hi> was to be totally omitted, as its only use (that of explaining the prints) was gone: but to supply the
					place of it in bulk, lest <hi rend="italic">my works</hi> should be mistaken for the works of a flea, or a pismire, I promised to send
					him an equal weight of poetry or prose: so, since my return hither, I put up about two ounces of stuff; viz. The Fatal Sisters, The
					Descent of Odin (of both which you have copies),<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.601tm" /> a bit of something from the Welch, and certain little
					notes, partly from justice (to acknowledge the debt, where I had borrowed any thing), partly from ill temper,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.602tm" /> just to tell the gentle reader, that Edward I. was not Oliver Cromwell, nor queen Elizabeth the witch of
						Endor.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.603tm" /> This is literally all; and with all this I shall be but a shrimp of an author. I gave leave
					also to print the same thing at Glasgow;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.604tm" /> but I doubt my packet has miscarried, for I hear nothing of
					its arrival as yet. To what you say to me so civilly, that I ought to write more, I reply in your own words (like the
						pamphleteer,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.605tm" /> who is going to confute you out of your own mouth), What has one to do, when <hi
						rend="italic">turned of fifty,</hi> but really to think of finishing? However, I will be candid (for you seem to be so with me), and
					avow to you, that till fourscore-and-ten, whenever the humour takes me, I will write, because I like it; and because I like myself
					better when I do so. If I do not write much, it is because I cannot.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.606tm" /> As you have not this last plea, I
					see no reason why you should not continue as long as it is agreeable to yourself, and to all such as have any curiosity of judgment in
					the subjects you choose to treat. By the way let me tell you (while it is fresh) that lord Sandwich, who was lately dining at
					Cambridge, speaking (as I am told) handsomely of your book, said, it was pity you did not know that his cousin Manchester<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.607tm" /> had a genealogy of the kings, which came down no lower than to Richard III. and at the end of it were two
					portraits of Richard and his son, in which that king appeared to be a handsome man. I tell you it as I heard it: perhaps you may think
					it worth enquiring into.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.608tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I have looked into Speed and Leslie.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.609tm" /> It appears very odd, that Speed in the speech he makes for P.
					Warbeck, addressed to James IV. of Scotland, should three times cite the <hi rend="italic">manuscript proclamation</hi> of Perkin, then
					in the hands of Sir Robert Cotton;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.610tm" /> and yet when he gives us the proclamation afterwards (on occasion
					of the insurrection in Cornwall) he does not cite any such manuscript. In Casley's Catalogue of the Cotton Library<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.611tm" /> you may see whether this manuscript proclamation still exists or not: if it does, it may be found at the
					Musæum. Leslie will give you no satisfaction at all: though no subject of England, he could not write freely on this matter, as the
					title of Mary his mistress to the crown of England was derived from that of Henry VII. Accordingly, he every where treats Perkin as an
					impostor; yet drops several little expressions inconsistent with that supposition. He has preserved no proclamation: he only puts a
					short speech into Perkin's mouth, the substance of which is taken by Speed, and translated in the end of his, which is a good deal
					longer: the whole matter is treated by Leslie very concisely and superficially. I can easily transcribe it, if you please; but I do not
					see that it could answer any purpose.</p>
				<p>Mr. Boswell's book I was going to recommend to you, when I received your letter: it has pleased and moved me strangely, all (I mean)
					that relates to Paoli. He is a man born two thousand years after his time! The pamphlet proves what I have always maintained, that any
					fool may write a most valuable book by chance, if he will only tell us what he heard and saw with veracity. Of Mr. Boswell's truth I
					have not the least suspicion, because I am sure he could invent nothing of this kind.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.612tm" /> The true title
					of this part of his work is, A Dialogue between a Greengoose and a Hero.</p>
				<p>I had been told of a manuscript in Benet-library: the inscription of it is <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium Fratris Simonis
						Simeonis</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.613tm" />
					<hi rend="italic">et Hugonis Illuminatoris,</hi> 1322. Would not one think this should promise something? They were two Franciscan
					friars that came from Ireland, and passed through Wales to London, to Canterbury, to Dover, and so to France in their way to Jerusalem.
					All that relates to our own country has been transcribed for me, and (sorry am I to say) signifies not a halfpenny: only this little
					bit might be inserted in your next edition of the Painters:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.614tm" /> Ad aliud caput civitatis (Londoniæ) est
					monasterium nigrorum monachorum nomine Westmonasterium, in quo constanter et communiter omnes reges Angliæ sepeliuntur&#x2014;et eidem
					monasterio quasi immediatè conjungitur illud famosissimum palatium regis, in quo est illa vulgata camera, in cujus parietibus sunt
					omnes historiæ bellicæ totius Bibliæ ineffabiliter depictæ, atque in Gallico completissimè et perfectissimè conscriptæ, in non modicâ
					intuentium admiratione et maximâ regali magnificentiâ.</p>
				<p>I have had certain observations on your Royal and Noble Authors given me to send you perhaps about three years ago: last week I found
					them in a drawer, and (my conscience being troubled) now enclose them to you. I have even forgot whose they are. </p>
				<p>I have been also told of a passage in Ph. de Comines, which (if you know) ought not to have been passed over. The book is not at hand
					at present, and I must conclude my letter.</p>

				<p>I plague you to death, but I must reply a few more words. I shall be very glad to see in print, and to have those that are worthy see
					your ancient odes; but I was in hopes there were some pieces too that I had not seen. I am sorry there are not. </p>
				<p>I troubled you about Perkin's proclamation, because Mr. Hume lays great stress upon it, and insists, that if Perkin affirmed his
					brother was killed, it must have been true, if he was true duke of York. Mr. Hume would have persuaded me that the proclamation is in
					Stowe, but I can find no such thing there; nor, what is more, in Casley's catalogue, which I have twice looked over carefully. I wrote
					to sir David Dalrymple<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.616tm" /> in Scotland, to enquire after it, because I would produce it if I could, though
					it should make against me: but he, I believe, thinking I enquired with the contrary view, replied very drily, that it was published at
					York, and was not to be found in Scotland. Whether he is displeased that I have plucked a hair from the tresses of their great
						historian;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.617tm" /> or whether, as I suspect, he is offended for king William;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.618tm"
					 /> this reply was all the notice he took of my letter and book. I only smiled, as I must do when I find one party is angry with me on
					king William's, and the other on lord Clarendon's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.619tm" /> account.</p>
				<p>The answer advertised is Guthrie's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.620tm" /> who is furious that I have taken no notice of <hi rend="italic"
						>his</hi> History. I shall take as little of his pamphlet; but his end will be answered, if he sells that and one or two copies of his
					History. Mr. Hume, I am told, has drawn up an answer too, which I shall see, and, if I can, will get him to publish;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.621tm" /> for, if I should ever choose to say any thing more on this subject, I had rather reply to him than to
					hackney-writers: &#x2013;to the latter, indeed, I never will reply.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.622tm" /> A few notes I have to add that
					will be very material; and I wish to get some account of a book that was once sold at Osborn's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.623tm" /> that
					exists perhaps at Cambridge, and of which I found a memorandum t'other day in my note-book. It is called A paradox, or apology for
					Richard III. by sir William Cornwallis.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.624tm" /> If you could discover it, I should be much obliged to you.</p>
				<p>Lord Sandwich, with whom I have not exchanged a syllable since the general warrants,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.625tm" /> very obligingly
					sent me an account of the roll at Kimbolton;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.626tm" /> and has since, at my desire, borrowed it for me and sent
					it to town.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.627tm" /> It is as long as my lord Lyttelton's History;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.628tm" /> but by what
					I can read of it (for it is both ill-written and much decayed), it is not a roll of kings, but of all that have been possessed of, or
					been earls of Warwick: or have not&#x2013;for one of the first earls is Æneas. How, or wherefore, I do not know, but amongst the first
					is Richard III. in whose reign it was finished, and with whom it concludes. He is there again with his wife and son, and Edward IV. and
						Clarence<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.629tm" /> and his wife, and Edward their son (who unluckily is a little old man), and Margaret
					countess of Salisbury, their daughter&#x2013;But why do I say with these? There is every body else too&#x2013;and what is most
					meritorious, the habits of all the times are admirably well observed from the most savage ages. Each figure is tricked with a pen, well
					drawn, but neither coloured nor shaded. Richard is straight, but thinner than my print; his hair short, and exactly curled in the same
					manner; not so handsome as mine, but what one might really believe intended for the same countenance, as drawn by a different painter,
					especially when so small; for the figures in general are not so long as one's finger. His queen is ugly, and with just such a square
					forehead as in my print, but I cannot say like it. Nor, indeed, where forty-five figures out of fifty (I have not counted the number)
					must have been imaginary, can one lay great stress on the five. I shall, however, have these figures copied, especially as I know of no
					other image of the son. Mr. Astle<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.630tm" /> is to come to me to-morrow morning to explain the writing.</p>
				<p>I wish you had told me in what age your Franciscan friars lived; and what the passage in Comines is.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.631tm" />
					I am very ready to make amende honorable.</p>
				<p>Thank you for the notes on the Noble Authors. They shall be inserted when I make a new edition, for the sake of the trouble the
					person has taken, though they are of little consequence. Dodsley has asked me for a new edition;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.632tm" /> but I
					have had little heart to undertake such work, no more than to mend my old linen. It is pity one cannot be born an ancient, and have
					commentators to do such jobs for one!</p>

				<p>The title-page will probably suffice you; but if you would know any more of him, he has read nothing but the common chronicles, and
					those without attention: for example, speaking of Anne the queen, he says, she was <hi rend="italic">barren,</hi> of which Richard had
					often complained to Rotheram. He extenuates the murder of Henry VI. and his son: the first, he says, might be a malicious accusation,
					for that many did suppose he died of mere melancholy and grief: the latter cannot be proved to be the action of Richard (though
					executed in his presence); and if it were, he did it out of love to his brother Edward. He justifies the death of the lords at Pomfret,
					from reasons of state, for his own preservation, the safety of the commonwealth, and the ancient nobility. The execution of Hastings he
					excuses from necessity, from the dishonesty and sensuality of the man: what was his crime with respect to Richard, he does not say. Dr.
					Shaw's sermon<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.635tm" /> was not by the king's command, but to be imputed to the preacher's own ambition: but if
					it was by order, <hi rend="italic">to charge his mother with adultery was a matter of no such great moment, since it is no wonder in
						that sex.</hi> Of the murder in the Tower he doubts; but if it were by his order, the offence was to God, not to his people; and <hi
						rend="italic">how could he demonstrate his love more amply, than to venture his soul for their quiet?</hi> Have you enough, pray? You
					see it is an idle declamation, the exercise of a school-boy that is to be bred a statesman.</p>
				<p>I have looked in Stowe: to be sure there is no proclamation<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.636tm" /> there. Mr. Hume, I suppose, means <hi
						rend="italic">Speed,</hi> where it is given, how truly I know not; but that he had seen the original is sure, and seems to quote the
					very words of it in the beginning of that speech which Perkin makes to James IV. and also just afterwards, where he treats of the
					Cornish rebellion.</p>
				<p>Guthrie, you see, has vented himself in the Critical Review.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.637tm" /> His History I never saw, nor is it
					here, nor do I know any one that ever saw it. He is a rascal, but rascals may chance to meet with curious records; and that commission
					to sir J. Tyrrell<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.638tm" /> (if it be not a lye) is such: so is the order for Henry the sixth's funeral. I would
					by no means take notice of him, write what he would. I am glad you have seen the Manchester-roll.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.639tm" />
				</p>
				<p>It is not I that talk of Phil. de Comines; it was mentioned to me as a thing that looked like a voluntary omission: but I see you
					have taken notice of it in the note to p. 71,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.640tm" /> though rather too slightly. You have not observed that
					the same writer says, c. 55, <hi rend="italic">Richard tua de sa main, ou fit tuer en sa presence, quelque lieu apart, ce bon homme le
						roi Henry.</hi> Another oversight I think there is at p. 43, where you speak of the <hi rend="italic">roll of parliament</hi> and the
					contract with lady Eleanor Boteler,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.641tm" /> as things newly come to light; whereas Speed has given at large
					the same roll in his History.</p>

				<p>I dont mean to trouble you with any farther Searches; but I must thank you for your readiness to oblige me. I will try to return it
					by keeping the Roll<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.643tm" /> as long as I can, that you may see it, if you look Londonwards; it is really a
					great Curiosity, &amp; will furnish one with remarks. Not that I am going to answer such trumpery as Guthrie's,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.644tm" /> who does not seem to disagree with me (tho I scarce can discover the scope of his jumbled arguments) but is
					angry I did not declare I agreed with him, tho I vow I never saw his book. It shall rest in peace for me, as all such Writers ever
					shall. The few Criticisms I have suffered have done more than my own arguments coud: They have strengthened my opinion, seeing how
					little can be advanced to overturn it. Mr Hume has shown me an answer he has drawn up. It is nothing but his former arguments enlarged:
					no one new fact or new light.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.645tm" /> I am trying to persuade him to publish it, that I may have occasion to
					add a Short appendix, with some striking particulars; not, to dispute more with him. I propose too to give eight or nine figures from
					Rous's roll.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.646tm" /> In the Coronation roll, is this Entry, which you &amp; I overlooked: <hi rend="italic"
						>Things ordered in haste by My Lord Duke of Buckingham.</hi> Then Immediately follow the Robes for Edward 5th.&#x2013;proof I think of
					the Design that He shoud walk.</p>
				<p>I shall correct a mistake I find (by Guthrie) I made, about the Duke of Albany.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.647tm" /> For the Confession
					of the Lady Butler, I take it to be an absolute Lie. The Commission of Sr James Tirrel I have not had time to search for in
						Rymer,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.648tm" /> where I suppose it is, if any where. But you did not observe that It is dated in Nov. 1482.
					Consequently under Edward <hi rend="italic">4th</hi>. &amp; if true, contradicts Sr T. More, who says Tirrel was kept down. If the Date
					shoud be 83; it was subsequent by two or three months to the time assigned for the murder. But enough of all this till I see you.</p>
				<p>Have you read the two new volumes of Swift?<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.649tm" /> The Second is the dullest heap of trumpery, flattery,
					&amp; folly. The first is curious indeed! what a Man! what childish, vulgar Stuff! what gross language to his Goddess! what a curious
					Scene when the Ministry thought themselves ruined! what Cowardice in Such a Bully!&#x2013;then his libels, &amp; his exciting the
					Ministers to punish libels in the same breath!&#x2013;the next moment generous &amp; benevolent. But his great Offence with me, is

					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I am so totally uninform'd, indeed so helpless, in matters of law, that there is no one perhaps in the kingdom you could apply to for
					advice with less effect, than to me: this ought to be a sufficient warning to you not to pay more attention to me than I deserve. you
					may too take into the account my natural indolence &amp; indisposition to act, &amp; a want of alacrity in indulging any distant hopes,
					however flattering; as you have (I think) from nature the contrary fault, a Medium between us would be possibly the best rule of
					action. </p>
				<p>One thing I am persuaded I see clearly, &amp; would advise strongly: it is, that you should never think of separating your
						cause<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.654tm" /> from that of your Nephew.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.655tm" /> your rights are exactly the same,
					you must share the profit &amp; the loss. he is a Minor &amp; under your care: to set up any distinct claim for the private advantage
					of yourself &amp; family, would surely hurt you in the eye of the world. the slightest apprehension of any such thought will make a
					total breach between Mr Ll:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.656tm" /> &amp; you, whose advice &amp; activity seem of such singular use in all
					your designs. this will force you to pass your whole time at London without other assistance, than what you must hire; &amp; perhaps
					produce another law-suit between you and your own Nephew. but you speak irresolutely yourself on this head, &amp; as you have had a
					little time to think, since you wrote your letter, I doubt not, you have already drop'd any such idea. it remains then to communicate
					immediately to Mr. Ll: the opinions of De Grey,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.657tm" /> &amp; to advise with him (without reserve) about this
					application to the Treasury.</p>
				<p>Now I am going to talk of what I do not understand: but from what I have lately heard of the D: of Portland<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.658tm" /> &amp; Sr J: Lowther's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.659tm" /> case<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.660tm" /> (wch is in some
					respects similar) if you obtain this Grant<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.661tm" /> (for wch you must pay too a certain rent to the Crown;
					&amp; if any one outbids you, they will be prefer'd) your right to it is never the more establish'd, provided any body start up to
					contest it with you at law, for the Courts are still open to redress any injury, that a person pleads he has received by such grant. in
					this therefore I should be guided by Mr Ll: and Mr Madocks.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.662tm" /> the application to the Treasury is easy, I
					believe: St:, or Mr W:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.663tm" /> will probably acquaint you of the manner: but I could give you good reasons,
					why the former should not be ask'd to interpose personally in obtaining it, at least why it would be uneasy to him to do so.</p>
				<p>There remains then the foundation of all this, the legal right, you &amp; your Nephew have, to this extention of the tythes, about
					wch your counsel themselves seem dubious enough; &amp; you cannot expect me to be clearer than they, especially as there are two things
					not at all explained in your letter, viz: What is that Grant to Morrice &amp; Cole, &amp; when made? &amp; who is Rector of the Church,
					or (if a Vicar) who presents him, for it appears not to be you? all that you seem to me clearly entitled to is a right of continuing
					the suit,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.664tm" /> wch your Brother begun, wch contest may beget others to infinity. shall I tell (but without
					consequence) what I should wish? that you would sell these tythes out of hand, &amp; with them all your expectations &amp; all your
					lawsuits: if these are worth any thing, Purchasers may be found sanguine enough to give such a price, as Mr Jonathan did, &amp; you
					will be no loser; if they are not, you may lose a little money, &amp; in my opinion be a great gainer: for this inundation of business,
					of eager hopes, &amp; perhaps more reasonable fears, is the thing in the world the most contrary to your peace, &amp; that of your
					family. but I determine nothing, we shall hear what the three Referees<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.665tm" /> say, &amp; what Mr Ll:
					determines upon it.</p>
				<p>I have made hast to answer you, considering the difficulty of the case: you will therefore excuse me for my intention's sake. Mason
					is arrived in London, &amp; lives for the present at Stonhewer's, in Queen-Street. I rejoiced to hear, you got so well over that
					Monster the Trent.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.666tm" /> make my best compliments to Mrs Wharton, &amp; your Family. I am sorry to hear Miss

				<p>By this time I conclude, you are return'd to Cambridge: tho' I thought it a long time, before I heard of you from Thrandeston,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.674tm" /> and could have wish'd you had stay'd longer with Palgrave: perhaps you are in Hertfordshire, however I write
					at a venture. I went to Mr. Mann's,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.675tm" /> and (tho' he is in Town) not finding him at home, left a note with
					an account of my business with him, and my direction. I have had no message in answer to it: so possibly he has written to you, and
					sent the papers. I know not.</p>
				<p>Mr. Precentor is still here, and not in haste to depart, indeed I do not know whether he has not a fit of the Gout: it is certain, he
					had a pain yesterday in his foot, but whether owing to Bechamel<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.676tm" /> and Claret, or to cutting a corn, was
					not determined: he is still at Stonhewer's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.677tm" /> house, and has not made his journey to Eton and to Bath
					yet, tho' he intends to do it.</p>
				<p>We have had no mobs, nor illuminations<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.678tm" /> yet, since I was here. Wilkes's speech<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.679tm" /> you have seen; the Court<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.680tm" /> was so surprised at being contemn'd to its face,
					and in the face of the World, that the Chief in a manner forgot the matter in hand, and enter'd into an apology for his own past
					conduct, and so (with the rest of his Assessors) shuffled the matter off, and left the danger to the officers of the Crown, that is
					indeed, to the Ministry. Nobody had ventured, or would venture to serve the <hi rend="italic">Capias</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.681tm" /> upon him. I cannot assure, it is done yet; tho' yesterday I heard it was, and (if so) he comes again
					to-day into Court.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.682tm" /> He professes himself ready to make any submissions to the K., but not to give up
					his pursuit of Ld. HI.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.683tm" /> The Delavals<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.684tm" /> attend very regularly, and take
					notes of all that passes. His writ of Error on the Outlawry must come to a decision before the House of Lords.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.685tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I was not among the Coal-heavers at Shadwell,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.686tm" /> tho' seven people lost their lives in the fray: Nor
					was I in<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.687tm" /> Goodmans Fields<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.688tm" /> where the Bawdy-house was demolish'd. The
					Ministry (I believe) are but ticklish in their situation: they talk of Grenville<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.689tm" /> and his Brother,

					signed by him last night; that on Wednesday I received a very honourable letter from the D. of Grafton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.702tm"
					 /> acquainting me that his majesty had ordered him to offer me this Professorship, and much more, which does me too much credit by
					half for me to mention it. The Duke adds, <hi rend="italic">that from private as well as public considerations, he takes the warmest
						part in approving this measure of the King's.</hi> These are his own words. You see there are princes (or ministers) left in the
					world, that know how to do things handsomely; for I profess I never asked for it, nor have I seen his Grace before or after this
					event.</p>
				<p>Dr. R.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.703tm" /> (not forgetting a certain lady of his) is so good to you, and to me, that you may (if you
					please) show him my letter. He will not be critical as to the style, and I wish you would send it also to Mr. Brown, for I have not
					time to write to him by this day's post; they need not mention this circumstance to others, they may learn it as they can. Adieu!</p>
				<p>I receive your letter of July 28 (while I am writing), consult your friends over the way, they are as good as I, and better. All I
					can say is, the Board<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.704tm" /> have been so often used to the name of Antrobus lately, that I fear they may
					take your petition not in good part. If you are sure of the kindness or interest of Mr. A.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.705tm" /> the
					opportunity should not be lost; but I always a little distrust new friends and new lawyers.</p>
				<p>I have found a man, who has brought Mr. Eyres (I think) up to my price,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.706tm" /> in a hurry; however he
					defers his final answer till Wednesday next. He shall not have it a shilling lower, I promise; and if he hesitates, I will rise upon
					him like a fury. Good-night. I am ever yours.</p>
				<p>How could you dream that St: or Hinchl:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.707tm" /> would ask this for themselves? The only people that ask'd it
					were Lort,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.708tm" /> Marriott,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.709tm" /> Delaval,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.710tm" />
						Jebb,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.711tm" /> and Peck&#x2013;,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.712tm" /> at least I have heard of no more. Delaval
					always communicated his thoughts to me, knowing I would make no ill use of that knowledge. Lort is a worthy man, and I wish he could
					have it, or something as good: the rest are nothing. </p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I have been remiss in answering your last letter, wch was sent me to Ramsgate from Cambridge: for I have pass'd a good part of the
					summer in different parts of Kent<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.714tm" /> much to my satisfaction. could I have advised any thing essential in
					poor Mrs Ett:s<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.715tm" /> case, I had certainly replied immediately: but we seem of one mind in it. there was
					nothing left but to appeal to Delegates<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.716tm" /> (let the trouble &amp; expence be what they will almost) &amp;
					to punish, if it be practicable, that old Villain, who upon the bench of justice dared to set at nought all common sense &amp; all
					humanity.</p>
				<p>I write to you now chiefly to tell you (and I think you will be pleased, (nay, I expect the whole family will be pleased with it,)
					that on Sunday se'nnight, Brockett<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.717tm" /> died by a fall from his horse, being (as I hear) drunk, &amp; some
					say, returning from Hinchinbroke:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.718tm" /> that on the Wednesday following, I received a letter from the D: of
						Grafton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.719tm" /> saying, He had the K:s commands to <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> me the vacant Professorship,
					that &amp;c: (but I shall not write all he says) &amp; he adds at the end, <hi rend="italic">that from private as well as publick
						considerations He must take the warmest part in approving so well judged a measure as he hopes I do not doubt of the real regard &amp;
						esteem with wch he has the honor to be,</hi> &amp;c: there's for you. so on Thursday the K: sign'd the warrant, &amp; next day at his
					Levee I kiss'd his hand.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.720tm" /> he made me several gracious speeches, wch I shall not report, because every
					body, who goes to court, does so. by the way I desire, you would say, that all the Cabinet-Council in words of great favour approved
					the nomination of your humble Serv:t &amp; this I am bid to say,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.721tm" /> &amp; was told to leave my name at
					their several doors. I have told you the outside of the matter &amp; all the manner: for the inside you know enough easily to guess t,
					&amp; you will guess right.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.722tm" /> as to his Grace I have not seen him before or since.</p>
				<p>I shall continue here perhaps a fortnight longer, perishing with heat: I have no Thermometer with me, but I feel it as I did at
					Naples. next summer (if it be as much in my power, as it is in my wishes) I meet you at the foot of Skiddaw. my respects to Mrs
					Wharton, &amp; the young Ladies great &amp; small: love to Robin &amp; Richard.</p>
				<closer>
					<salute>Adieu! I am truly <lb /> Yours. </salute>
				</closer>
				<postscript>
					<p>At your instance I have kiss'd Mrs Forster,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.723tm" /> &amp; forgot old quarrels. I went to visit the
						Daughter, who has been brought to bed of a Boy, &amp; there I met with the Mother.</p>

					Maj:s hand. what he said, I will not tell you: because every body, that has been at Court, tells what the K: said to them: it was very
					gracious however. remember you are to say, that the Cabinet-council all approved of the nomination in a particular manner. it is hinted
					to me, that I should say this publickly, &amp; I have been at their several doors to thank them. now I have told you all the exterior,
					the rest (the most essential) you can easily guess, &amp; how it came about. now are you glad, or sorry, pray?</p>

				<p>That Mr. Brockett has broke his neck,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.728tm" /> you will have seen in the News-papers; &amp; also that I (your

				<p>I am commission'd to make you an offer, wch, I have told him (not the King) you would not accept, long ago. Mr. Barrett<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.729tm" /> (whom you know) offers to you 100£ a-year with meat, drink, washing, chaise, &amp; lodging, if you will

					for such an opportunity. no matter! I desire you to write your answer to him yourself as civil, as you think fit, &amp; then let me

					<dateline>Blundeston, Aug. 6, 1768. </dateline>
					<salute>My dear Mr. Professor of history and modern languages,</salute>
				</opener>
				<p> accept my sincerest congratulations; your letter and the St. James's Chronicle<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.734tm" /> brought me the
					welcome news by the same post yesterday. I read of Brockett's death before, and thought of you the instant, but feared because I wished
					it of all things, and have been very anxious for information. I am pleased that you have an honourable and profitable office, but more
					pleased a thousand times that you have it in so honourable a way. The king and his cabinet council are grown into great favour with me,
					and I believe if I was in parliament I should vote with them right or wrong all the next session. But come and let me tell you how glad
					I am better than I can write it; you said you would, but now you are grown rich, God knows how you may be altered. I should have
					written before to invite you, only that I knew not where to direct. Mr. Professor of Arabic<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.735tm" /> has
					honoured me with his company already for two days in his way to a rich pupil, the son of a Norwich alderman; he says it is <hi
						rend="italic">vastly pretty</hi> to have a garden of one's own, with gooseberries and currants, and a field, and a horse, and a cow;
					in short, he will not be at peace till he has bought a wife<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.736tm" /> and an estate, and then I fear least of
					all; Lord Fitzwilliam<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.737tm" /> says it will kill him.</p>
				<p>And now for Mr. Barrett, to whom I am much obliged, and certainly do not like him the worse for thinking me agreeable; but how I
					might like him after I had been shut up in a chaise with him for a thousand miles, I know not, especially as I should only be one
					remove above the valet de chambre with double wages. Besides, I am just settled here at a great expense; and then to desert my cure of
					souls when I have hardly given them their first dressing, would not be the part of a good physician. Add to this, that my uncles<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.738tm" /> might not be pleased, and that my mother would be left alone in the land of strangers, and I think I have
					reason sufficient to write him a very civil refusal, which I mean to do if you have no objection. Nevertheless, I burn with desire to
					see Italy, and would give a limb to be in danger of breaking my neck among the Alps, or being buried alive in everlasting snow; but all
					this I hope to be able to do in my own way, and at my own time. I have just had a letter from Claxton<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.739tm" />
					(that man of rueful countenance, whom you, that are without prejudices, cannot bear for that reason) from among the glaciers, which
					inflames me more than ever. Shall I then ever see a valley of ice which was formed at the creation, or only a day or two afterwards at
					farthest? mountains of ice that will never melt till the earth dissolves? and crevices through which one might descend to the nursery
					of earthquakes and volcanoes? not with Mr. Barrett,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.740tm" /> I believe. At present I live in a country where
					nature dare not exert herself in this bold way, and thinks she has done very handsomely for me in giving me wood, a pretty lake
					bordered with it, a hanging meadow on which the house stands, and a dry soil; indeed, two miles from me there is the sea, which does
					not break into the hollows of rocks, but looks vast, and blue, and beautiful, and roars as it does in other places; I bathe in it, you
					may admire it, and catch strange fishes, and call them by strange names, and tell me their history and adventures. Then my own lake
					produces tench, and pike, and eels in abundance. We have no neighbourhood, which you will say (I hear you say it) is a blessing; but it
					is a reason de plus why you (if riches have not extinguished every spark of charity in you) should come and comfort our solitude. My
					mother says you have forgot her, but is enough of a Christian to send you her compliments and congratulations.</p>

				<p>What can I say more to you about Oddington.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.767tm" /> you seem engaged to Mr Wood,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.768tm" /> &amp; in consequence of that to Mr Meller.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.769tm" /> Mr Br: is not here, &amp; (if he
					were) I could by no means consult him about it: his view to the Mastership<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.770tm" /> will be affected by it just
					in the same manner, as if he had accepted of Framlingham,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.771tm" /> &amp; had it in possession, wch I little
					doubt he would accept, if it were vacant &amp; undisputed. as to the dubious title<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.772tm" /> he told me of it
					himself, &amp; I was surprised at it, as a thing quite new to me. this is all I know, nor (if you were under no previous engagement)
					could I <hi rend="italic">direct,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">determine</hi> your choice: it ought to be entirely your own, as to accept
					or refuse ought to be entirely his. the only reason I have suggested any thing about it is, that (when we first talk'd on this subject)
					you ask'd me, whether Mr B: would have it, &amp; I replied, it would hardly be worth his while, as Framl:m was of greater value, in wch
					(all things consider'd) I may be mistaken.</p>
				<p>I give you joy of your vase: I can not find P. et P. PA. in my Sertorius Ursatus,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.773tm" /> &amp; consequently
					do not know their meaning. what shall I do? My learned Brethren are dispersed over the face of the earth. I have lately dug up three
					small vases, in workmanship at least equal to yours: they were discover'd at a place call'd Burslem in Staffordshire, &amp; are very
					little impair'd by time. on the larger one is this inscription very legible 9/,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.774tm2" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.774tm1" /> &amp; on the two smaller this 7/.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.774tm" /> you will oblige me with an
					explanation, for Ursatus here too leaves us in the dark.</p>
				<p>I fear the K:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.775tm" /> of Denmark could not stay, till your hair was dress'd. he is a genteel lively figure,
					not made by nature for a Fool: but surrounded by a pack of Knaves, whose interest it is to make him one, if they can. he has overset
					poor Dr Marriot's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.776tm" /> head here, who raves of nothing else from morning till night.</p>
				<p>Pray make my best compliments to your Brother-Residentiary Mr Cowper,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.777tm" /> &amp; thank him for his
					obliging letter of congratulation, wch I did not at all expect: present also my respects &amp; acknowledgements to Miss Patty. Mr
					Bedingfield I shall answer soon, both as to his civilities &amp; his reproaches: the latter you might have prevented by telling him,

					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>It is some time, since I received from Mr Foulis two copies of my poems,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.779tm" /> one by the hands of Mr T:
						Pitt,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.780tm" /> the other by Mr Merrill, a Bookseller of this Town. it is indeed a most beautiful edition,
					&amp; must certainly do credit both to him, &amp; to me: but I fear, it will be of no other advantage to him; as Dodsley<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.781tm" /> has contrived to glut the Town already with two editions beforehand, one of 1500, &amp; the other of 750,
					both indeed far inferior to that of Glasgow, but sold at half the price.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.782tm" /> I must repeat my thanks, Sr,
					for the trouble you have been pleased to give yourself on my account, &amp; thro' you I must desire leave to convey my acknowledgements
					to Mr Foulis, for the pains &amp; expence he has been at in this publication.</p>
				<p>We live at so great a distance, that perhaps you may not yet have learn'd, what I flatter myself you will not be displeased to hear:
					the middle of last summer his Majesty was pleased to appoint me Regius Professor of Modern History in this University: it is the best
					thing the Crown has to bestow (on a Layman) here: the salary is 400£ per ann: but what enhances the value of it to me is, that it was
					bestowed without being ask'd. the Person, who held it before me, died on the Sunday, &amp; on Tuesday<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.783tm" />
					following the Duke of Grafton wrote me a letter to say, that the King offer'd me this Office, with many additional expressions of
					kindness on his Grace's part, to whom I am but barely known, &amp; whom I have not seen either before or since he did me this favor.
					instances of a benefit so nobly confer'd, I believe, are rare, &amp; therefore I tell you of it as a thing that does honor, not only to
					me, but to the Minister.</p>
				<p>As I lived here before from choice, I shall now continue to do so from obligation. if business or curiosity should call you
					southwards, you will find few Friends, that will see you with more cordial satisfaction, than Sr </p>

				<p>Not a single word, since we parted at Norwich,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.785tm" /> &amp; for ought I know, you may be ignorant, how I
					fell into the jaws of the King of Denmark at Newmarket, &amp; might have stay'd there till this time, had I not met with Mr
					Vicechancellor and Mr Orator<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.786tm" /> with their Diplomas &amp; speeches,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.787tm" /> who
					on their return to Cambridge sent me a chaise from thence, &amp; deliver'd me out of that den of thieves. however, I pass'd a night
					there; &amp; in the next room, divided from me by a thin partition, was a drunken Parson &amp; his party of pleasure singing &amp;
					swearing &amp; breaking all the ten commandments. all that I saw on my way else was the Abbey-Church at Wyndham,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.788tm" /> to learned eyes a beautiful remnant of antiquity, part of it in the style of Henry the 1st &amp; part in
					that of Henry the 6th; the wooden fretwork of the north-ile you may copy, when you build the best room of your new Gothick parsonage.
					it will cost but a trifle.</p>
				<p>So now I am going to Town about my business,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.789tm" /> wch (if I dispatch to my mind) will leave me at rest,
					&amp; with a tolerably easy temper for one while. I return hither as soon as I can, &amp; give you notice, what a sweet humor I am in.
					Mrs Nicholls &amp; you take advantage of it, come &amp; take possession of the Lodge at Trinity-Hall (by the way I am commission'd to
					offer it to you by Dr Marriott<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.790tm" /> for that purpose, &amp; you have nothing to do but to thank him for his
					civilities, &amp; say, at what time you intend to make use of them). and so we live in clover, &amp; partake the benefits of a
					University education together, as of old. Palgrave is return'd from Scotland, &amp; will perhaps be here. Mason too, if he is not
					married (for such a report there is)<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.791tm" /> may come, &amp; Dr Hallifax is always at your service. Ld Richard
						Cavendish<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.792tm" /> is come: he is a sensible Boy, aukward &amp; bashful beyond all imagination, &amp; eats a
					buttock of beef at a meal. I have made him my visit, &amp; we did tolerably well considering. Watson<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.793tm" />
					is his publick Tutor, &amp; one Winstanley<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.794tm" /> his private: do you know him?</p>
				<p>Marriott has begun a subscription for a Musical Amphitheatre, has appropriated 500£ (Mr. Titley's legacy to the University) to that
					purpose, &amp; gives 20 Guineas himself.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.795tm" /> he has drawn a design for the building &amp; has printed an
					Argument about the Poors-rates, wch he intended to have deliver'd from the Bench, but one of the Parties drop'd the cause. he has spoke
					at the Quarter-Sessions two hours together, &amp; moved the Towns-People to tears, &amp; the University to laughter. at laying down his
						office<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.796tm" /> too he spoke Latin, &amp; said, <hi rend="italic">Invidiam, &amp;</hi>
					<hi rend="italic">opinionum de me commenta delebit dies.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.797tm" /> he enlarged (wch is never done) on the qualifications of Hinchliffe<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.798tm" />
					his Successor, <hi rend="italic">qui Mores hominum multorum vidit &amp; urbes</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.799tm" /> &#x2013;<hi rend="italic">qui cum Magnis vixit &amp; placuit.</hi> next day Hinchliffe made his
					speech, &amp; said not one word (tho' it is usual) of his Predecessor. I tell you Cambridge News for want of better. they say,

				<p>You have reason to call me negligent, nor have I any thing to alledge in my own defence, but two successive fits of the gout, wch
					tho' weakly &amp; not severe, were at least dispiriting, &amp; lasted a long time. I rejoiced to hear your alarms for Robin<anchor

					a part of us perhaps at the foot of Skiddaw. I am to call Mason in my way, &amp; bring him with me to visit his own works.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.843tm" /> Mr Brown admitted your Nephew<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.844tm" /> according to your orders, &amp; will provide
					him with a room against October.</p>
				<p>I do not guess, what intelligence St: gave you about my employments: but the worst employment I have had has been to write something
					for musick against the D: of G:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.845tm" /> comes to Cambridge. I must comfort myself with the intention: for I
					know it will bring abuse enough on me. however it is done, &amp; given to the V: Chancellor,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.846tm" /> &amp;
					there is an end. I am come to Town for a fortnight, &amp; find every thing in extreme confusion,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.847tm" /> as

					ready to side with the strongest. the only good thing I hear is, that France is on the brink of a general bankrupcy, &amp; their fleet
					(the only thing they have laid out money on of late) in no condition of service. </p>

				<p>I am sorry to think you are coming to town at a time when I am ready to leave it;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.850tm" /> but so it must be,
					for here is a son born unto us,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.851tm" /> and he must die a heathen without your assistance; Old Pa. is in
					waiting ready to receive you at your landing. Mason set out for Yorkshire this morning. Delaval is by no means well, and looks sadly,
					yet he goes about and talks as loud as ever;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.852tm" /> he fell upon me tooth and nail (but in a very friendly
					manner) only on the credit of the newspaper, for he knows nothing further; told me of the obloquy that waits for me; and said
					everything to deter me from doing a thing that is already done. Mason<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.853tm" /> sat by and heard it all with a
					world of complacency. </p>
				<p> You see the determination of a majority of fifty-four,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.854tm" /> only two members for counties among them. It
					is true that Luttrell was insulted, and even struck with a flambeau, at the door of the House of Commons on Friday night;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.855tm" /> but he made no disturbance, and got away. How he will appear in public I do not conceive. Great disturbances
					are expected, and I think with more reason than ever. Petitions to Parliament, well-attended, will (I suppose) be the first step, and
					next, to the King to dissolve the present Parliament. I own I apprehend the event whether the mob or the army are to get the
					better.</p>
				<p>You will wish to know what was the real state of things on the <hi rend="italic">hearse-day</hi>:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.856tm" />
					the driver, I hear, was one Stevenson, a man who lets out carriages to Wilkes's party, and is worth money. Lord Talbot<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.857tm" /> was not rolled in the dirt, nor struck, nor his staff broken, but made the people a speech, and said he
					would down on his knees to them if they would but disperse and be quiet. They asked him whether he would stand on his head for them,
					and begun to shoulder him, but he retired among the soldiers. Sir Ar. Gilmour<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.858tm" /> received a blow, and
					seized the man who struck him, but the fellow fell down and was hustled away among the legs of the mob. At Bath House<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.859tm" /> a page came in to his mistress, and said, he was afraid Lord Bath<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.860tm" /> did not
					know what a disturbance there was below; she asked him if 'the house was on fire?' he said 'No; but the mob were forcing into the
					court:' she said 'Is that all; well I will go and look at them:' and actually did so from some obscure window. When she was satisfied,
					she said, 'When they are tired of bawling I suppose they will go home.'</p>
				<p>Mr. Ross, a merchant, was very near murdered, as the advertisement sets forth, by a man with a hammer, who is not yet discovered, in
					spite of the £600 reward.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.861tm" /> I stay a week longer.</p>

				<p>I know you think that I have entirely neglected botany, or you would have had twenty troublesome letters before now; but this is not
					entirely the case, as my journal will witness for me when you see it. I have indeed met with severe rebuffs and discouragements, and
					difficulties that almost reduced me to despair; but I believe it is because I ventured beyond my strength, and expected to make out
					readily every wild flower I found, instead of condescending to take my garden for a master, and learn gradually the botanical
					characters from flowers I know; which seems more reasonable than endeavouring to discover the others by characters I have not yet
					learnt. I have not writ to ask questions, because there would be no end of it, and I am sure I should never make you understand me
					except I enclosed the plant. But I have had innumerable to ask if you had been at my elbow. Having nothing to say myself, I waited for
					some time rather in expectation of hearing some news of the Ode,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.875tm" /> which I long most impatiently to see;
					Oh! whilst I remember it, (to set my conscience at ease) I must tell you that some time ago I received a letter from Woodyer<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.876tm" /> the bookseller, (to acknowledge the receipt of some money I sent him) in which there was a postscript longer
					than the letter itself, to say how much obliged &amp;c. he should be if, by my interposition, he (Woodyer) might be admitted to a share
					in the sale of the Ode said to be yours, if it should be printed, for that it would sell prodigiously. Unto which, his most humble
					request, I have so far graciously condescended as (not answering his letter, because that would divulge the secret which is already
					public) to make it known to you. Thus much I have done, because as he did me the honour of preferring me, I was not certain whether in
					justice I could suppress it entirely; how just or reasonable the request itself may be I know not, and so I wash my hands of him and
					ask pardon.</p>
				<p>Why will you mention Skiddaw<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.877tm" /> or any such insolent mountain to me who live within two miles of the
					sea and cannot see it till I come within two yards of it? think of me when you listen to the sound of Lawdoor<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.878tm" /> waterfall, or wander among the rocks of Borrowdale, and send an eagle to fetch me from Dorsetshire and
					deliver me from the naked downs. Alas! alas! when shall we live among the Grisons? visit the Bishop of Coire? or pass a summer at
					Chiavenna?</p>
				<p>I have been very idle (that you will not be surprised to hear) except in my garden, and there very diligent, very much amused, very
					much interested, and perfectly dirty with planting, transplanting &amp;c. and with tolerable success.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.879tm" />
					Besides I have now free access, and an open firm descent to my lake, and a very shady little walk that winds a little way close on its
					bank; and have planted weeping willows, and poplars, and alders, and sallows; and shall expect you next summer to come and find fault,
					and sit in the shade. </p>
				<p>I am just reading Mémoires de Sully,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.880tm" /> which please me extremely, more than almost any thing; and
					particularly what I read a few minutes ago, the surprise of the fortress of Fescamp by Bois Rosé.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.881tm" /> You
					remember the fifty men hanging by a rope midway of a perpendicular rock six hundred feet high, and the sea at bottom rising till it set
					the boats that brought them adrift, and prevented the possibility of their returning. Fear seizing the foremost man, and Bois Rosé (who
					was last of the train) climbing over the backs of the fifty to lead them on. It is told with all its circumstances more like the
					surprise of Platæa or other such descriptions in Thucydides, than a French writer.</p>
				<p>Dr. Marriott has not writ, and is, I hear, to have his house full of foreign ambassadors; so our Cambridge journey is at an end. We
					shall set out from hence about the middle of July for the west; but I beseech you let me hear first from you; and ....<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.882tm2" />
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.882tm1" /> from Keswick it would really be cruel to refuse me a line, though you will not write from
						.....<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.882tm" /> or Cambridge.</p>
				<p>I should be extremely obliged to you if you would once more lend me your book of Wilton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.883tm" /> if you
					could send it by the fly, to be left at Payne's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.884tm" /> at the Meuse Gate<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.885tm" /> for
					me till I call; and add necessary instructions for the country about Southampton, for that must be my Keswick this year.</p>
				<p>Adieu! I really want to hear a little oftener from you; if I thought writing about nothing, on my part, would have any effect, that
					should not stand in the way.</p>

				<p>All, alas! is over, and I have been compelled by cruel necessity to figure to myself all the splendours and glories; how the Ode was
					sung, and played, and applauded (all but) as it deserves (the first glimpse I shall see of it will be I suppose in the critical
						review<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.922tm" /> ). How thoroughly sensible of the honour the duke was. How he was pressed to death by people
					who never saw a duke before; and thought themselves in heaven if a chance word dropped on them in the crowd. How Dr. Gordon<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.923tm" /> clapped with both his hands, and grinned with all his teeth when his Grace but looked as if he would speak,
					and bowed lower than even clergymen are used to bow. I should have been glad to have heard the Ode, and very glad to have seen you; but
					I suspect that I shall like it as well without Dr. Randal's music. And as for you, you would have been so beset with ministers of state
					that I should have seen nothing of you; so I thought it best to remain in quiet here, rather than to put myself to a great deal of
					inconvenience, expense, and trouble, to get into the midst of a bustle which I hate, and be disappointed at last. </p>
				<p>We shall depart, I suppose, the middle of this month, so, if after that time you direct to me at Augustus Floyer's,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.924tm" /> Esq. at Upwey, near Dorchester, Dorsetshire, I shall be very glad to hear news from Yorkshire, or
					Cumberland, or Westmoreland, or no news at all provided I hear.</p>
				<p>Many thanks for the Wilton book!<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.925tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I have read the first volume of Robertson.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.926tm" /> It may be all vastly right, but it certainly is a little
					tiresome to have five hundred pages of disquisitions on feudal tenures, &amp;c. such a pile of gothic learning in your way, when you
					are all impatience to begin an interesting history; and surely, it is not good policy in the author to tire you to death in order to
					interest you the more. All that I know is, that it is not at all like Mémoires de Sully. But then Robertson is a grave historian, and
					the other only a writer of memoirs. Why then a writer of memoirs is a better thing than an historian.</p>
				<p>And so my mother waits to carry my letter to the post, and desires her compliments. </p>
				<p>I am at the moment <hi rend="italic">inebriated</hi> with gales of mignonette of my own sowing. 'Oh the pleasures of the plain',
					&amp;c. For God's sake leave Pembroke (at least when there are leaves on the trees) and get a house in Wales, and let me come and pass
					a summer with you. Adieu! do not despise me when you come among the mountains.</p>

				<p>I have been so unfortunate as to lose the pleasure of seeing your two Friends Dr Gerard<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.931tm" /> &amp; Mr
					Duncan. when they pass'd thro' this place, I was at London; &amp; tho' Ld Strathmore told me, there was a Gentleman, who had letters

				<p>The late ceremony of the D: of Grafton's Installation<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.933tm" /> has hinder'd me from acknowledging sooner the
					satisfaction your friendly compliment gave me. I thought myself bound in gratitude to his Grace unasked to take upon me the task of
					writing those verses, that are usually set to musick on this occasion. I do not think them worth sending you, because they are by
					nature doom'd to live but a single day, or if their existence is prolong'd beyond that date, it is only by means of news-paper
						parodies,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.934tm" /> &amp; witless criticism.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.935tm" /> this sort of abuse I had reason
					to expect, but did not think it worth while to avoid it.</p>
				<p>Mr Foulis is magnificent in his gratitude:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.936tm" /> I can not figure to myself, how it can be worth his while
					to offer me such a present. you can judge better of this than I, &amp; if he does not hurt himself by it, I would accept the <hi

					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.937tm" /> with many thanks. I have not got, nor even seen it.</p>
				<p>I could wish to subscribe to his new edition of Milton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.938tm" /> &amp; desire to be set down for two copies

				<p>You have taught me to long for a second letter, &amp; particularly for what you say will make the contents of it:<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.939tm" /> I have nothing to requite it with, but plain &amp; friendly truth, &amp; that you shall have, join'd to a
					zeal for your fame, &amp; a pleasure in your success.</p>
				<p>I am now setting forward on a journey towards the North of England, but it will not reach so far as I should wish, as I must return

					<p>Wd at N:W. clouds &amp; sunshine. a mile &amp; ½ from Brough<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.952tm" /> on a hill lay a great army
							encamp'd.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.953tm" /> to the left open'd a fine valley with green meadows &amp; hedge-rows, a Gentleman's house
						peeping forth from a grove of old trees. on a nearer approach appear'd myriads of horses &amp; cattle in the road itself &amp; in all
						the fields round me, a brisk stream hurrying cross the way, thousands of clean healthy People in their best party-color'd apparel,
						Farmers &amp; their families, Esquires &amp; their daughters, hastening up from the dales &amp; down the fells on every side,
						glittering in the sun &amp; pressing forward to join the throng: while the dark hills, on many of whose tops the mists were yet
						hanging, served as a contrast to this gay &amp; moving scene, wch continued for near two miles more along the road, and the crowd
						(coming towards it) reach'd on as far as Appleby. </p>
					<p>On the ascent of the hill above Appleby the thick hanging wood &amp; the long reaches of the Eden (rapid, clear, &amp; full as ever)
						winding below with views of the Castle &amp; Town gave much employment to the mirror:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.954tm" /> but the sun was
						wanting &amp; the sky overcast. oats &amp; barley cut every where, but not carried in. passed Kirby-thore, Sr W: Dalston's<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.955tm" /> house at Acorn bank, Whinfield-park, Harthorn-oaks, Countess-pillar, Brougham-Castle, Mr Brown (one of ye
						six Clerks)<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.956tm" /> his large new house, cross'd the Eden &amp; the Eimot<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.957tm" />
						(pronounce <hi rend="italic">Eeman</hi>) with its green vale, &amp; at 3 o'clock dined with Mrs Buchanan, at <hi rend="italic"
							>Penrith</hi> on trout &amp; partridge. in the afternoon walk'd up the <hi rend="italic">Beacon-hill</hi> a mile to the top, saw
						Whinfield and Lowther-parks, &amp; thro' an opening in the bosom of that cluster of mountains, wch the Doctor well remembers, the Lake
						of Ulz-water, with the craggy tops of a hundred nameless hills. these to W: &amp; S:, to the N: a great extent of black &amp; dreary
						plains, to E: <hi rend="italic">Cross-fell</hi> just visible thro' mists &amp; vapours hovering round it.</p>
					<p>Oct: 1. Wd at S:W: a grey autumnal day, air perfectly calm &amp; gentle. went to see <hi rend="italic">Ulz-water</hi> 5 miles
						distant. soon left the Keswick-road &amp; turn'd to the left thro' shady lanes along the Vale of <hi rend="italic">Eeman,</hi> wch
						runs rapidly on near the way, ripling over the stones. to the right is <hi rend="italic">Delmaine,</hi> a large fabrick of pale red
						stone with 9 windows in front &amp; 7 on the side built by Mr Hassel,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.958tm" /> behind it a fine lawn
						surrounded by woods &amp; a long rocky eminence rising over them. a clear &amp; brisk rivulet runs by the house to join the Eeman,
						whose course is in sight &amp; at a small distance.</p>
					<p>Farther on appears <hi rend="italic">Hatton St John,</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.959tm" /> a castle-like old mansion of Mr Huddleston. approach'd <hi rend="italic">Dunmallert,</hi> a fine
						pointed hill, cover'd with wood planted by old Mr Hassle beforemention'd, who lives always at home &amp; delights in planting. walk'd
						over a spungy meadow or two &amp; began to mount this hill thro' a broad &amp; strait green alley among the trees, &amp; with some
						toil gain'd the summit. from hence saw the Lake opening directly at my feet majestic in its calmness, clear &amp; smooth as a blew
						mirror with winding shores &amp; low points of land cover'd with green inclosures, white farm-houses looking out among the trees,
						&amp; cattle feeding. the water is almost every where border'd with cultivated lands gently sloping upwards till they reach the feet
						of the mountains, wch rise very rude &amp; aweful with their broken tops on either hand. directly in front at better than 3 mile's
						distance, <hi rend="italic">Place-Fell,</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.960tm" /> one of the bravest among them, pushes its bold broad breast into the midst of the Lake &amp; forces
						it to alter it's course, forming first a large bay to the left &amp; then bending to the right.</p>
					<p>I descended <hi rend="italic">Dunmallert</hi> again by a side avenue, that was only not perpendicular, &amp; came to <hi
							rend="italic">Barton</hi>-bridge over the <hi rend="italic">Eeman,</hi> then walking thro' a path in the wood round the bottom of the
						hill came forth, where the <hi rend="italic">Eeman</hi> issues out of the lake, &amp; continued my way along it's western shore close

					<p>The figure of <hi rend="italic">Ulz-water</hi> nothing resembles that laid down in our maps: it is 9 miles long, &amp; (at widest)
						under a mile in breadth. after extending itself 3 m: &amp; ½ in a line to S: W: it turns at the foot of <hi rend="italic"
							>Place-Fell,</hi> almost due West, and is here not twice the breadth of the Thames at London. it is soon again interrupted by the

						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.964tm" /> in a pleasant grave day, perfectly calm &amp; warm, but without a gleam of sunshine: then the sky
						seeming to thicken, the valley to grow more desolate, &amp; evening drawing on, I return'd by the way I came to <hi rend="italic"
							>Penrith.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>Oct: 2. Wd at S: E:, sky clearing, <hi rend="italic">Cross-fell</hi> misty, but the outline of the other hills very distinct. set
						out at 10 for <hi rend="italic">Keswick,</hi> by the road we went in 1767.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.965tm" /> saw <hi rend="italic"
							>Greystock</hi>-town &amp; castle to the right, wch lie only 3 miles (over the Fells) from <hi rend="italic">Ulz-water.</hi> pass'd

						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.967tm" /> at the feet of <hi rend="italic">Saddleback,</hi> whose furrow'd sides were gilt by the noon-day
						Sun, while its brow appear'd of a sad purple from the shadow of the clouds, as they sail'd slowly by it. the broad &amp; green valley
						of <hi rend="italic">Gardies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Low-side,</hi> with a swift stream glittering among the cottages &amp; meadows
						lay to the left; &amp; the much finer (but narrower) valley of St <hi rend="italic">John's</hi> opening into it: <hi rend="italic"
							>Hill-top</hi> the large, tho' low, mansion of the Gaskarths,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.968tm" /> now a Farm-house, seated on an
						eminence among woods under a steep fell, was what appear'd the most conspicuous, &amp; beside it a great rock like some antient tower
						nodding to its fall.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.969tm" /> pass'd by the side of <hi rend="italic">Skiddaw</hi> &amp; its cub call'd <hi
							rend="italic">Latter-rig,</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.970tm" /> &amp; saw from an eminence at two miles distance the Vale of Elysium in all its verdure, the sun

					<p>Dined by two o'clock at the Queen's Head, &amp; then straggled out alone to the <hi rend="italic">Parsonage,</hi> fell down on my
						back across a dirty lane with my glass open in one hand, but broke only my knuckles: stay'd nevertheless, &amp; saw the sun set in all
						its glory.</p>
					<p>Oct: 3. Wd at S: E:, a heavenly day. rose at seven, &amp; walk'd out under the conduct of my Landlord<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.971tm"
						 /> to <hi rend="italic">Borrodale.</hi> the grass was cover'd with a hoar-frost, wch soon melted, &amp; exhaled in a thin blewish
						smoke. cross'd the meadows obliquely, catching a diversity of views among the hills over the lake &amp; islands, &amp; changing
						prospect at every ten paces, left <hi rend="italic">Cockshut</hi> &amp; Castle-hill (wch we formerly mounted) behind me, &amp; drew
						near the foot of <hi rend="italic">Walla-crag,</hi> whose bare &amp; rocky brow, cut perpendicularly down above 400 feet, as I guess,
						awefully overlooks the way: our path here tends to the left, &amp; the ground gently rising, &amp; cover'd with a glade of scattering
						trees &amp; bushes on the very margin of the water, opens both ways the most delicious view, that my eyes ever beheld. behind you are
						the magnificent heights of <hi rend="italic">Walla</hi>-crag; opposite lie the thick hanging woods of Ld Egremont,<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.972tm" /> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Newland</hi>-valley with green &amp; smiling fields embosom'd in the dark cliffs;
						to the left the jaws of <hi rend="italic">Borodale,</hi> with that turbulent Chaos of mountain behind mountain roll'd in confusion;
						beneath you, &amp; stretching far away to the right, the shining purity of the <hi rend="italic">Lake,</hi> just ruffled by the breeze
						enough to shew it is alive, reflecting rocks, woods, fields, &amp; inverted tops of mountains, with the white buildings of <hi
							rend="italic">Keswick, Crosthwait</hi>-church, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Skiddaw</hi> for a back-ground at distance. oh Doctor! I never
						wish'd more for you; &amp; pray think, how the glass played its part in such a spot, wch is called <hi rend="italic"
							>Carf-close-reeds</hi>: I chuse to set down these barbarous names, that any body may enquire on the place, &amp; easily find the
						particular station, that I mean. this scene continues to <hi rend="italic">Barrow-gate,</hi> &amp; a little farther, passing a brook
						called <hi rend="italic">Barrow-beck,</hi> we enter'd <hi rend="italic">Borodale.</hi> the crags, named <hi rend="italic"
							>Lodoor-banks</hi> now begin to impend terribly over your way; &amp; more terribly, when you hear, that three years since an immense
						mass of rock tumbled at once from the brow, &amp; bar'd all access to the dale (for this is the only road) till they could work their
						way thro' it. luckily no one was passing at the time of this fall; but down the side of the mountain &amp; far into the lake lie
						dispersed the huge fragments of this ruin in all shapes &amp; in all directions. something farther we turn'd aside into a coppice,
						ascending a little in front of <hi rend="italic">Lodoor</hi> water-fall. the height appears to be about 200 feet, the quantity of
						water not great, tho' (these three days excepted) it had rain'd daily in the hills for near two months before: but then the stream was
						nobly broken, leaping from rock to rock, &amp; foaming with fury. on one side a towering crag, that spired up to equal, if not
						overtop, the neighbouring cliffs (this lay all in shade &amp; darkness) on the other hand a rounder broader projecting hill
							shag'd<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.973tm" /> with wood &amp; illumined by the sun, wch glanced sideways on the upper part of the cataract.
						the force of the water wearing a deep channel in the ground hurries away to join the lake. we descended again, &amp; passed the stream
						over a rude bridge. soon after we came under <hi rend="italic">Gowder-crag,</hi> a hill more formidable to the eye &amp; to the
						apprehension than that of <hi rend="italic">Lodoor</hi>; the rocks atop, deep-cloven perpendicularly by the rains, hanging loose &amp;
						nodding forwards, seem just starting from their base in shivers: the whole way down &amp; the road on both sides is strew'd with piles
						of the fragments strangely thrown across each other &amp; of a dreadful bulk. the place reminds one of those passes in the Alps, where
						the Guides tell you to move on with speed, &amp; say nothing, lest the agitation of the air should loosen the snows above, &amp; bring
						down a mass, that would overwhelm a caravan. I took their counsel here and hasten'd on in silence. </p>

					<salute> Dear Sir </salute>
				</opener>
				<p> For these three or four months past I have been in a state of dissipation and idleness, endeavouring if possible to rid myself of a
					vertigo which has troubled me much of late years, and which while it lasts disqualifies me entirely for reading and writing. If it had
					not been for this, I should long ere now have answered the very obliging letter I had the honour to receive from You in August<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.982tm" /> last. Soon after I received it I wrote to M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Foulis, telling him that You had made
					choice of the Glasgow Homer, and desired to subscribe for two copies of the large paper of his Milton. That work is now begun;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.983tm" /> and is said by those who have seen a specimen to be one of the most magnificent books ever published in this
					country.</p>
				<p> I wonder You can bring Yourself to think so meanly of the Installation-Ode; for You say it can only live a few days. I am quite
					certain this is a mistake; it will make the name of the Duke of Grafton known as long as the English language is understood; which is
					an honour, no other great man of this age has any chance of obtaining at the hands of the muses. I will not say that this Ode is equal
					to some of Your other poems; but I will venture to affirm that it is the finest panegyrical poem in the world. The whole is contrived
					and executed in the highest Dithyrambick taste. The beginning and end peculiarly excellent. The figure of Newton<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.984tm" /> is exceeded by nothing in descriptive poetry. When You adopt the <hi>liquid language of the skies</hi>, Your
					sentiments words and numbers are perfectly Elysian. That happiness of expression for which You are so very remarkable, appears
					throughout.&#x2014;'And bid it round heaven's altars shed The fragrance of its blushing head'<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.985tm" /> is only
					one instance, but it is a signal one. I known not whether I most admire the propriety of the metaphor, the beauty of the image, or the
					delicacy of the expression: all the three are in perfection. Your imitation of Milton is delightful.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.986tm" />
					The poetry is exquisite, and the imitation exact: but it has another claim to my approbation. I have always thought the hymn on the
					nativity, notwithstanding its faults, to be one of the finest poems in the world; I think I am intoxicated, or rather bewitched with
					it: and Your making choice of it for an object of Your imitation seems to justify my opinion of it.&#x2014;But I cannot within the
					compass of a letter say one half of what I have to say in praise of Your poem. I have heard some people object to its obscurity; but
					sure their attention must be very superficial, or their apprehension very weak, who do so. I understood every word of it at the first
					reading, except one passage (which however I made out at the second) where the printer had made nonsense, by placing a full point at
					the end of a line where there ought to have been no point at all.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.987tm" /> Do, Sir, permit us to hope, now when
					Your hand is in again, that You will not abandon the muses. This age is indeed nowise remarkable for good qualities of any kind: taste
					and learning were never I believe less attended to in any period since the revival of letters; but still there are a few honest and
					sensible folks among us, whom it is certainly worth while to do something to please. My attention was never more awakened than when I
					found by the newspapers that You was to compose this Installation-ode; if You knew half the pleasure I received from it, You would not
					wonder that I am so very anxious to see more of Your works. I hope You have no vertigo's or headachs to excuse You: God forbid. May You
					long, very long, live healthy and happy.</p>
				<p> It is a strange transition, and yet I must now speak a little of my own works. I told You in my last,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.988tm"
					 /> that I had begun a kind of poem, and I promised to send a specimen, which accordingly I have enclosed.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.989tm" /> The piece will consist of three books of which near two are finished; but bad health and necessary business
					have prevented my making any additions these six months. However I am in no hurry. As this will probably be the last of my poetical
					compositions I propose to finish it at great leisure. It is indeed the only one of them for which I have any esteem; which perhaps is
					owing to its being the latest. Whether it will have any merit or not I cannot say; I am sure my other things have very little. The
					title of this piece is <hi>The Minstrel</hi>. The first hint of it was suggested by M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Percy's Essay on the
					English Minstrels.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.990tm" /> There was something in the character of the Minstrel there described, which struck
					me and pleased me. I suppose my Hero born in a solitary and mountainous country; by trade a shepherd. His imagination is wild and
					romantick; but in the first part of his life he has hardly any opportunity of acquiring knowledge, except from that part of the book of
					nature which is open before him. The first Canto is a kind of poetical or sentimental history of this period. In the second he meets
					with a Hermit, who in his youth had been a man of the world, and who instructs Edwin (the young Minstrel) in history, philosophy,
					musick, &amp;c. The young man, agreably to that character which he bears from the beginning, shows a strong attachment to poetry, which
					the old hermit endeavours by all possible means to discourage. Edwin seems disposed to follow his advice, and abandon the muses; when
					an irruption of Danes or robbers (I have not as yet determined which) strips him of his little all, and obliges him through necessity
					to take his harp on his shoulder, and go abroad into the world in the character of a Minstrel. And here the poem is to end.&#x2014;The
					measure is the same with that of Spenser in the fairy queen; but I have avoided all antiquated expressions. I chose this measure,
					partly because it seemed to suit my Gothick subject; but chiefly because it is extremely agreable to my ear, and seems to admit greater
					varieties in the composition than any other English stanza. The passage I have sent you for a specimen is in my judgment neither one of
					the best nor one of the worst. It is taken from the first book, which describes the hero's pursuits and amusements in the first years
					of his life. I beg Your pardon for sending it in so bad order. I cut it out of a book to save the labour of transcribing, which the
					present state of my health would render a very uneasy work. The numbers of the stanza's will direct to the order in which they are to
					be read. You need not return them as I have another copy.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.991tm" /></p>

				<p>I have two reasons for writing, one because it seems an age to me since I heard of you, the other to mention that I have taken the
					liberty of recommending to your notice Mr. de Bonstetten.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.993tm" /> I have given him a letter to you, but yet I
					thought it best to apprise you of it, that he might not come an entire stranger. I picked him out from among the mob in the rooms

					common for his age, and very little spoiled considering that he is the only son of the treasurer of Berne, and of one of the six noble
					families which bear the chief sway in the aristocracy. He was first at the university of Lausanne; afterwards his father sent for him
					home; then he went to Leyden, but thought Holland a most triste pays, and begged to be released, so he had leave to cross over to
					England; he seems to have read, and to be unwilling now to waste his time if he knew how to employ it; I think he is vastly better than
					any thing English (of the same age) I ever saw; and then, I have a partiality to him because he was born among mountains; and talks of

					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.995tm" /> is completed, and you are forced to grope your way; of the cries of eagles and other birds of prey
					adding to the horror; in short, of all the wonders of his country, which disturb my slumbers in Lovingland.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.996tm" /> I made Wheeler<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.997tm" /> acquainted with him, who likes him as well as I, and has
					given him letters to Mr. Pitt<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.998tm" /> and to Mrs. Hay,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.999tm" /> which have succeeded
					very well. When I go into Switzerland I am to be so directed! so recommended! and to travel with such advantages! but it is absolutely
					necessary to pass a month at Zurich to learn German; and the mountains must be traversed on foot; avec des Grimpons aux mains, and
					shoes of a peculiar construction. I'd give my ears to try.</p>
				<p>So, because it would have given me infinite pleasure to have heard from the banks of Derwent Water, and because I gave you my
					direction, I was not to have a single line! for my part I would have told you long ago how I was pleased with the country about
					Southampton, delighted with Nettley Abbey, enchanted with the Isle of Wight, (where I passed three days alone searching every corner)
					how from thence I went to my cousin's in Dorsetshire,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1000tm" /> stayed six weeks, and came hither on my cousin
						Fanny's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1001tm" /> account; how pleased we were with Stour Head!<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1002tm" /> how much
					more than pleased with Mr. Morris's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1003tm" /> (which we saw just when Autumn had begun to tinge the woods with
					a thousand beautiful varieties of colour) and with other scenes on the Severn. All this and more I would have told you; and if I had
					been as tedious as an Emperor, I could have found in my heart to have bestowed it all upon you, only you took care to secure yourself
					by leaving me without a direction. </p>
				<p>We leave this place on Wednesday se'nnight and shall be in town the Saturday after. God knows where you are, but if in town I shall
					have a chance of seeing you. We shall depart for Blundeston the Wednesday after. </p>
				<p>This place (Bath) surprised and pleased me extremely at first. It was so new a sight to see a town built of hewn stone, instead of
					ragged and dirty brick, and streets and parades on a regular plan, and above all the circus, instead of the confused heap of buildings
					of all shapes and sizes which compose every other town in England. The neighbouring country is very pretty&#x2013; hills of some height
					with cultivated valleys running among them, the principal one (which leads to Bristol) watered by the Avon. There are many fine trees
					in the hedge-rows; and some woods clothing the sides of the hills. I have seen Mr. Mason's monument for his wife,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1004tm" /> and like it; but the medallion is I think too small; and the sculpture so small and delicate that it is
					seen to disadvantage at the height where it is placed.</p>
				<p>Perhaps you will believe me if I say I long to see or hear from you! indeed I do most devoutly. I have a heart that would be much
					more at home at Pembroke Hall than it is at Bath.</p>

					<p rendition="#center">(Journal continued).</p>
					<p>Oct: 3. The hills here are cloth'd all up their steep sides with oak, ash, birch, holly, &amp;c: some of it has been cut 40 years
						ago, some within these 8 years, yet all is sprung again green, flourishing, &amp; tall for its age, in a place where no soil appears
						but the staring rock, &amp; where a man could scarce stand upright. </p>
					<p>Met a civil young Farmer overseeing his reapers (for it is oat-harvest here) who conducted us to a neat white house in the village
						of Grange, wch is built on a rising ground in the midst of a valley. round it the mountains form an aweful amphitheatre, &amp; thro'
						it obliquely runs the Darwent clear as glass, &amp; shewing under it's bridge every trout, that passes. beside the village rises a
						round eminence of rock cover'd entirely with old trees, &amp; over that more proudly towers <hi rend="italic">Castle-crag,</hi>
						invested also with wood on its sides, &amp; bearing on its naked top some traces of a fort said to be Roman. by the side of this hill,
						wch almost blocks up the way, the valley turns to the left &amp; contracts its dimensions, till there is hardly any road but the rocky
						bed of the river. the wood of the mountains increases &amp; their summits grow loftier to the eye, &amp; of more fantastic forms:
						among them appear <hi rend="italic">Eagle's-cliff, Dove's-nest, Whitedale-pike,</hi> &amp;c: celebrated names in the annals of
						Keswick. the dale opens about four miles higher till you come to <hi rend="italic">Sea-Whaite</hi> (where lies the way mounting the
						hills to the right, that leads to the <hi rend="italic">Wadd-mines</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1006tm" /> ) all farther access is here barr'd to prying Mortals, only there is a little path winding over the
						Fells, &amp; for some weeks in the year passable to the Dale's-men; but the Mountains know well, that these innocent people will not
						reveal the mysteries of their ancient kingdom, the reign of Chaos &amp; old Night.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1007tm" /> only I learn'd,
						that this dreadful road dividing again leads one branch to <hi rend="italic">Ravenglas,</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1008tm" /> &amp; the other to <hi rend="italic">Hawkshead.</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1009tm" />
					</p>
					<p>For me I went no farther than the Farmer's (better than 4 m: from Keswick) at <hi rend="italic">Grange</hi>: his Mother &amp; he
						brought us butter, that Siserah would have jump'd at, tho' not in a lordly dish, bowls of milk, thin oaten-cakes, &amp; ale; &amp; we
						had carried a cold tongue thither with us. our Farmer was himself the Man, that last year plunder'd the Eagle's eirie: all the dale
						are up in arms on such an occasion, for they lose abundance of lambs yearly, not to mention hares, partridge, grous, &amp;c: he was
						let down from the cliff in ropes to the shelf of rock, on wch the nest was built, the people above shouting &amp; hollowing to fright
						the old birds, wch flew screaming round, but did not dare to attack him. he brought off the eaglet (for there is rarely more than one)
						&amp; an addle egg. the nest was roundish &amp; more than a yard over, made of twigs twisted together. seldom a year passes but they
						take the brood or eggs, &amp; sometimes they shoot one, sometimes the other Parent, but the surviver has always found a mate (probably
						in Ireland) &amp; they breed near the old place. by his description I learn, that this species is the <hi rend="italic">Erne</hi> (the
						Vultur <hi rend="italic">Albicilla</hi> of Linnæus in his last edition,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1010tm" /> but in yours <hi
							rend="italic">Falco Albicilla</hi>) so consult him &amp; Pennant<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1011tm" /> about it.</p>
					<p>Walk'd leisurely home the way we came, but saw a new landscape: the features indeed were the same in part, but many new ones were
						disclosed by the mid-day Sun, &amp; the tints were entirely changed. take notice this was the best or perhaps the only day for going
						up Skiddaw, but I thought it better employ'd: it was perfectly serene, &amp; hot as midsummer. </p>
					<p>In the evening walk'd alone down to the Lake by the side of <hi rend="italic">Crow-Park</hi> after sunset &amp; saw the solemn
						colouring of night draw on, the last gleam of sunshine fading away on the hill-tops, the deep serene of the waters, &amp; the long
						shadows of the mountains thrown across them, till they nearly touch'd the hithermost shore. at distance heard the murmur of many
						waterfalls not audible in the day-time.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1012tm" /> wish'd for the Moon, but she was <hi rend="italic">dark to
							me &amp; silent, hid in her vacant interlunar cave.</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1013tm" />
					</p>
					<p>Oct: 4. Wd E:, clouds &amp; sunshine, &amp; in the course of the day a few drops of rain. Walk'd to <hi rend="italic"
							>Crow-park,</hi> now a rough pasture, once a glade of ancient oaks, whose large roots still remain on the ground, but nothing has
						sprung from them. if one single tree had remain'd, this would have been an unparallel'd spot, &amp; Smith<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.1014tm" /> judged right, when he took his print of the Lake from hence, for it is a gentle eminence, not too high, on
						the very margin of the water &amp; commanding it from end to end, looking full into the <hi rend="italic">gorge of Borodale.</hi> I
						prefer it even to <hi rend="italic">Cockshut-hill,</hi> wch lies beside it, &amp; to wch I walk'd in the afternoon: it is cover'd with
						young trees both sown &amp; planted, oak, spruce, scotch-fir, &amp;c: all wch thrive wonderfully. there is an easy ascent to the top,
						&amp; the view far preferable to that on Castle-hill (wch you remember) because this is lower &amp; nearer to the Lake: for I find all
						points, that are much elevated, spoil the beauty of the valley, &amp; make its parts (wch are not large) look poor &amp;
							diminutive.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1015tm" /> while I was here, a little shower fell, red clouds came marching up the hills from the
							east,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1016tm" /> &amp; part of a bright rainbow seem'd to rise along the side of Castle-hill.</p>
					<p>From hence I got to the <hi rend="italic">Parsonage</hi> a little before Sunset, &amp; saw in my glass a picture, that if I could
						transmitt to you, &amp; fix it in all the softness of its living colours, would fairly sell for a thousand pounds. this is the
						sweetest scene I can yet discover in point of pastoral beauty. the rest are in a sublimer style.<lb />

					<p>(to be continued <hi rend="italic">without end.</hi>)</p>

				<div type="part">
					<p>P:S: I beg your pardon, but I have no franks. the quill arrived very safe, &amp; doubtless is a very snug and commodious method of
						travelling, for one of the rarities was alive &amp; hearty, &amp; was three times plunged in spirits, before I could get it to die.
						you are much improved in observation, for a common eye would certainly take it for a pismire. the place of its birth, form of ye

				<p> I troubled you some time ago, by M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason, with a petition on behalf of M<hi rend="super">r</hi> T.
						Warton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1024tm" /> who is digesting his history of E. Poetry, and wishes very much to know what your idea was
					for the scheme of such a work.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1025tm" /> I told him, I did not know what progress you had made in that design,
					or whether you had drawn out a plan of it, but that, if you had, I believed you would readily acquaint him with it. This passed in the
					Summer, &amp; since that I have heard nothing of him. But as I suppose you are now in college, after your various wanderings by sea and
					land, you will give me a pleasure to let me know what I shall further say on this subject to M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Warton. If you
					have any papers to communicate to him, &amp; will send them to me, I will take care they shall be transmitted safely to Oxford. I
					believe I may answer to you for him, that he will make no improper use of your favours.</p>
				<p> Of M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason I hear nothing, except, by D<hi rend="super">r</hi> Gisburne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1026tm" />
					that he is now at Aston. He complains, that you and I are hyper-critical, or rather hyper-political: But in this he is mistaken: We
					only wish to see his Georgic,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1027tm" /> truly Virgilian.</p>
				<p> M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Nevile has sent me his <hi>Imitations</hi><anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1028tm" />. They are not to be
					considered, as <hi>Satires</hi>, for popular reading; but as <hi>classical amusements</hi>, sometimes copying the sense, &amp;
					sometimes the manner, of his originals. And in this light, they have frequently great merit.</p>
				<p> You did not send me a copy of the Installation Ode; which piqued me, so much, that I was greatly disappointed when, with so good a
					disposition to find fault, I was obliged, with all the world, to commend &amp; admire it</p>

					<p>3 Jan: 1770. Pemb: C: </p>
					<p>Oct: 5. Wd N:E: Clouds &amp; sunshine. Walk'd thro' the meadows &amp; corn-fields to the Derwent &amp; crossing it went up <hi
							rend="italic">How-hill.</hi> it looks along Bassinthwaite<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1037tm" /> -water &amp; sees at the same time the
						course of the river &amp; a part of the Upper-Lake with a full view of Skiddaw. then I took my way through Portingskall<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.1038tm" /> village to the <hi rend="italic">Park,</hi> a hill so call'd cover'd entirely with wood: it is all a mass
						of crumbling slate. pass'd round its foot between the trees &amp; the edge of the water, &amp; came to a Peninsula that juts out into
						the lake &amp; looks along it both ways. in front rises Walla-crag, &amp; Castle-hill, the Town, the road to Penrith, Skiddaw &amp;
						Saddleback. returning met a brisk and cold N: Eastern blast, that ruffled all the surface of ye lake and made it rise in little waves
						that broke at the foot of the wood. After dinner walked up the Penrith-road 2 miles or more &amp; turning into a corn-field to the
						right, call'd Castle-Rigg, saw a Druid-Circle of large stones 108 feet in diameter, the biggest not 8 feet high, but most of them
						still erect: they are 50 in number. the valley of St John's appear'd in sight, &amp; the summits<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1039tm" /> of
							<hi rend="italic">Catchidecam</hi> (called by Camden, <hi rend="italic">Casticand</hi>) &amp; <hi rend="italic">Helvellyn,</hi> said
						to be as high as <hi rend="italic">Skiddaw,</hi> &amp; to rise from a much higher base. a shower came on, &amp; I return'd.</p>
					<p>Oct: 6. Wd E: Clouds &amp; sun. went in a chaise 8 miles along the east-side<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1040tm" /> of Bassingth: Water
						to <hi rend="italic">Ouse-Bridge</hi> (pronounce <hi rend="italic">Ews-bridge</hi>) the road in some part made &amp; very good, the
						rest slippery &amp; dangerous cart-road, or narrow rugged lanes but no precipices: it runs directly along the foot of Skiddaw.
						opposite to <hi rend="italic">Widhope-Brows</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1041tm" /> (cloth'd to the top with wood) a very beautiful view opens down the Lake, wch is narrower &amp;
						longer than that of Keswick, less broken into bays &amp; without islands. at the foot of it a few paces from the brink gently sloping
						upward stands <hi rend="italic">Armathwate</hi> in a thick grove of Scotch firs,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1042tm" /> commanding a noble
						view directly up the lake. at a small distance behind the house is a large extent of wood, &amp; still behind this a ridge of
						cultivated hills, on wch (according to the Keswick-proverb) <hi rend="italic">the Sun always shines.</hi> the inhabitants here on the
						contrary call the vale of Derwent-water <hi rend="italic">the Devil's Chamber-pot,</hi> &amp; pronounce the name of <hi rend="italic"
							>Skiddaw-fell</hi> (wch terminates here) with a sort of terror &amp; aversion. <hi rend="italic">Armathwate-House</hi> is a modern
						fabrick, not large, &amp; built of dark-red stone, belonging to Mr <hi rend="italic">Spedding,</hi> whose Gr:father was Steward to old
						Sr <hi rend="italic">Ja: Lowther,</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1043tm" /> &amp; bought this estate of the <hi rend="italic">Himers.</hi> so you must look for Mr Michell in
						some other country. the sky was overcast &amp; the wind cool, so after dining at a publick house, wch stands here near the bridge
						(that crosses the Derwent just where it issues from the lake) &amp; sauntering a little by the water-side I came home again. the
						turnpike is finish'd from Cockermouth hither (5 miles) &amp; is carrying on to Penrith. several little showers to-day. A Man came in,
						who said there was snow on <hi rend="italic">Cross-fell</hi> this morning.</p>
					<p>Oct: 7. Market-day here. Wd N:E: Clouds &amp; Sunshine. little showers at intervals all day. yet walk'd in the morning to Crow-park,
						&amp; in the evening up Penrith-road. the clouds came rolling up the mountains all round very [unpromising];<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.1044tm" /> yet the moon shone at intervals. it was too damp to go towards the lake. tomorrow mean to bid farewell to
						Keswick.</p>
					<p>Botany might be studied here to great advantage at another season because of the great variety of soils &amp; elevations all lieing
						within a small compass. I observed nothing but several curious Lichens, &amp; plenty of gale or Dutch myrtle perfuming the borders of
						ye lake. this year the Wadd<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1045tm" /> mine had been open'd (which is done once in 5 years) it is taken out in
						lumps sometimes as big as a man's fist, &amp; will undergo no preparation by fire, not being fusible. when it is pure soft, black,
						&amp; close-grain'd, it is worth sometimes 30 shillings a pound.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1046tm" /> there are no Charr ever taken in
						these lakes, but plenty in Butter-mere-water, which lies a little way N: of Borrodale, about Martlemas,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1047tm"
						 /> wch are potted here. they sow chiefly oats &amp; bigg<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1048tm" /> here, wch are now cutting, &amp; still on
						the ground.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1049tm" /> the rains have done much hurt; yet observe, the soil is so thin &amp; light, that no day
						has pass'd, in wch I could not walk out with ease, &amp; you know, I am no lover of dirt.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1050tm" />
						Fell-mutton is now in season for about six weeks; it grows fat on ye mountains, &amp; nearly resembles venison: excellent Pike &amp;
						Perch (here called <hi rend="italic">Bass</hi>)<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1051tm" /> trout is out of season. partridge in great plenty.
						Rec:t to dress Perch (for Mrs Wharton) </p>
					<p>Wash, but neither scale, nor gut them. broil till enough; then pull out the fins, &amp; open them along ye back, take out the bone
						&amp; all the inwards without breaking them. put in a large lump of butter &amp; salt, clap the sides together, till it melts, &amp;
						serve very hot. it it excellent. the skin must not be eaten.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1052tm" />
					</p>
					<p>Oct: 8. Left Keswick &amp; took the Ambleside-road in a gloomy morning. Wd E: &amp; afterwds N:E:. about 2 m: from the Town mounted
						an eminence call'd <hi rend="italic">Castle-rigg,</hi> &amp; the sun breaking out discover'd the most enchanting view I have yet seen
						of the whole valley behind me, the two lakes, the river, the mountains all in their glory! had almost a mind to have gone back again.
						the road in some few parts is not compleated, but good country-road thro' sound, but narrow &amp; stony lanes, very safe in broad
						day-light. this is the case about <hi rend="italic">Causeway-foot</hi> &amp; among Naddle-Fells to <hi rend="italic">Lanewaite.</hi>
						the vale you go in has little breadth, the mountains are vast &amp; rocky, the fields little &amp; poor, &amp; the inhabitants are now

						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1053tm" /> (call'd also Thirl-meer, or Wiborn<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1054tm" /> -water) &amp; soon descending
						on its margin. the lake from its depth looks black (tho' really clear as glass) &amp; from the gloom of the vast crags, that scowl
						over it: it is narrow &amp; about 3 miles long, resembling a river in its course. little shining torrents hurry down the rocks to join
						it, with not a bush to overshadow them, or cover their march. all is rock &amp; loose stones up to the very brow, wch lies so near

					<p>Past by the little Chappel of Wiborn,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1060tm" /> out of wch the Sunday-congregation were then issuing.</p>
					<p>Past a beck near <hi rend="italic">Dunmail-raise,</hi> &amp; enter'd <hi rend="italic">Westmoreland</hi> a second time. now begin to
						see <hi rend="italic">Helm-Crag</hi> distinguish'd from its rugged neighbours not so much by its height, as by the strange broken
						outline of its top, like some gigantic building demolish'd, &amp; the stones that composed it, flung cross each other in wild
						confusion. just beyond it opens one of the sweetest landscapes, that art ever attempted to imitate. (the bosom of ye mountains
						spreading here into a broad bason) discovers in the midst Grasmere-water. its margin is hollow'd into small bays with bold eminences
						some of rock, some of soft turf, that half conceal, and vary the figure of the little lake they command, from the shore a low
						promontory pushes itself far into the water, &amp; on it stands a white village with the parish-church rising in the midst of it,
						hanging enclosures, corn-fields, &amp; meadows green as an emerald with their trees &amp; hedges &amp; cattle fill up the whole space
						from the edge of the water &amp; just opposite to you is a large farm-house at the bottom of a steep smooth lawn embosom'd in old
						woods, wch climb half way up the mountain's side, &amp; discover above them a broken line of crags, that crown the scene. not a single
						red tile, no flaring Gentleman's house, or garden-walls, break in upon the repose of this little unsuspected paradise, but all is
						peace, rusticity, &amp; happy poverty in its neatest most becoming attire. </p>
					<p>The road winds here over <hi rend="italic">Grasmere</hi>-hill, whose rocks soon conceal the water from your sight, yet it is
						continued along behind them, &amp; contracting itself to a river communicates with Ridale-water, another small lake, but of inferior
						size &amp; beauty. it seems shallow too, for large patches of reeds appear pretty far within it. into this vale the road descends. on
						the opposite banks large &amp; ancient woods mount up the hills, &amp; just to the left of our way stands <hi rend="italic"
							>Rydale</hi>-hall, the family-seat of Sr Mic: Fleming,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1061tm" /> but now a farm-house, a large old-fashion'd
						fabrick surrounded with wood &amp; not much too good for its present destination. Sr Michael is now on his travels, &amp; all this
						timber far &amp; wide belongs to him. I tremble for it, when he returns. near the house rises a huge crag call'd <hi rend="italic"
							>Rydale-head,</hi> wch is said to command a full view of Wynander-mere, &amp; I doubt it not, for within a mile that great Lake is
						visible even from the road. as to going up the crag one might as well go up Skiddaw.</p>
					<p>Came to Ambleside, 18 m: from Keswick meaning to lie there, but on looking into the best bed-chamber dark &amp; damp as a cellar
						grew delicate, gave up Winandermere in despair &amp; resolved I would go on to <hi rend="italic">Kendal</hi> directly, 14 m: farther.
						the road in general fine turnpike, but some parts (about 3 m: in all) not made, yet without danger.</p>
					<p>Unexpectedly was well-rewarded for my determination. the afternoon was fine, &amp; the road for full 5 m: runs along the side of
						Winder-mere with delicious views across it &amp; almost from one end to the other. it is ten miles in length, &amp; at most a mile
						over, resembling the course of some vast &amp; magnificent river, but no flat marshy grounds, no osier-beds, or patches of scrubby
						plantation on its banks. at the head two vallies open among the mountains, one that by wch we came down, the other <hi rend="italic"
							>Langsledale,</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1062tm" /> in wch <hi rend="italic">Wreenose</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1063tm" /> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Hard-Knot,</hi> two great mountains, rise above the rest. from thence the
						fells visibly sink &amp; soften along its sides, sometimes they run into it (but with a gentle declivity) in their own dark &amp;
						natural complexion, oftener they are green &amp; cultivated with farms interspersed &amp; round eminences on the border cover'd with
						trees: towards the South it seem'd to break into larger bays with several islands &amp; a wider extent of cultivation. the way rises
						continually till at a place call'd <hi rend="italic">Orrest-head</hi> it turns to S:E: losing sight of the water.</p>
					<p>Pass'd by <hi rend="italic">Ings-Chappel, &amp; Staveley,</hi> but I can say no farther, for the dusk of evening coming on I enter'd
							<hi rend="italic">Kendal</hi> almost in the dark, &amp; could distinguish only a shadow of the Castle on a hill, &amp;
							tenter-grounds<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1064tm" /> spread far &amp; wide round the Town, wch I mistook for houses. my inn promised
						sadly having two wooden galleries (like Scotland) in front of it. it was indeed an old ill-contrived house, but kept by civil sensible
						people, so I stay'd two nights with them &amp; fared &amp; slept very comfortably.</p>
					<p>Oct: 9. Wd N:W: clouds &amp; sun. air mild as summer. all corn off the ground, sky-larks singing aloud (by the way I saw not one at
						Keswick, perhaps because the place abounds in birds of prey). went up the Castle-hill. the Town consists chiefly of three nearly
						parallel streets almost a mile long. except these all the other houses seem as if they had been dancing a country-dance &amp; were
						out: there they stand back to back, corner to corner, some up hill, some down without intent or meaning. along by their side runs a
						fine brisk stream, over which are 3 stone-bridges. the buildings (a few comfortable houses excepted) are mean, of stone &amp; cover'd
						with a bad rough-cast. near the end of the Town stands a handsome house of Col: Wilson's, &amp; adjoining to it the Church, a very
						large Gothick fabrick with a square Tower. it has no particular ornaments but double isles, &amp; at the east-end 4 chappels, or
						choirs. one of the <hi rend="italic">Pars,</hi> another of the <hi rend="italic">Stricklands,</hi> the 3d is the proper choir of ye
						church, &amp; the 4th of ye <hi rend="italic">Bellingcams,</hi> a family now extinct. <anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1065tm" /> is an
						altar-tomb of one of them dated 1577 with a flat brass, arms &amp; quarterings. &amp; in the window their arms alone, Arg: a
						hunting-horn, sab: strung Gules. in the <hi rend="italic">Strickland's</hi> chappel several modern monuments, &amp; another old
						altar-tomb, not belonging to the family: on the side of it, a Fess dancetty between 10 Billets (Deincourt?)<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.1066tm" /> in the <hi rend="italic">Parr</hi>-chappel is a third altar-tomb in the corner, no fig: or inscription,
						but on the side cut in stone an escutcheon of <hi rend="italic">Roos</hi> of Kendal (3 Water-Budgets) quartering <hi rend="italic"
							>Parr</hi> (2 bars in a bordure engrail'd). 2dly an escutcheon, Vaire, a Fess (for Marmion). 3dly. an escutcheon. three Chevronels
						braced &amp; a Chief (wch I take for Fitzhugh) at the foot is an escutcheon surrounded with the Garter, bearing <hi rend="italic"
							>Roos</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Parr</hi> quarterly, quartering the other two beforemention'd. I have no books to look in,
						therefore can not say, whether this is the Ld <hi rend="italic">Parr of Kendal</hi> (Queen Catharine's Father) or her Brother, the
						Marquis of <hi rend="italic">Northampton.</hi> it is a Cenotaph for the latter, who was buried at Warwick in 1571.<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.1067tm" /> the remains of the Castle are seated on a fine hill on the side of the river opposite to the Town. almost
						the whole enclosure of walls remains with 4 towers, 2 square &amp; 2 or 3 round, but their upper part &amp; embattlements are
						demolished. it is of rough stone &amp; cement, without any ornament or arms, round enclosing a court of like form &amp; surrounded by
						a mote, nor ever could have been larger than it is, for there are no traces of outworks. there is a good view of the town &amp; river
						with a fertile open valley, thro wch it winds. </p>
					<p>After dinner went along the Milthrop<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1068tm" /> -turnpike 4 m: to see the falls (or force) of the river <hi
							rend="italic">Kent.</hi> came to <hi rend="italic">Siserge</hi> (pronounce Siser) &amp; turn'd down a lane to the left. Siser, the
						seat of the <hi rend="italic">Stricklands</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1069tm" /> an old Catholick family, is an ancient Hall-house, with a very large tower embattled: the rest of
						the buildings added to this are of later date, but all is white &amp; seen to advantage on a back ground of old trees: there is a
						small park also well-wooded. opposite to this turn'd to the left &amp; soon came to the river. it works its way in a narrow &amp; deep
						rocky channel o'erhung with trees. the calmness &amp; brightness of ye evening, the roar of the waters, &amp; the thumping of huge
						hammers at an iron-forge not far distant made it a singular walk, but as to the falls (for there are two) they are not 4 feet high. I
						went on down to the forge &amp; saw the Dæmons at work by the light of their own fires: the iron is brought in pigs to Milthrop by sea
						from Scotland &amp;c. &amp; is here beat into bars &amp; plates. two miles farther at <hi rend="italic">Levens</hi> is the seat of Ld
							Suffolk,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1070tm" /> where he sometimes passes the summer. it was a favourite place of his late Countess: but
						this I did not see.</p>
					<p>Oct: 10. went by <hi rend="italic">Burton</hi> to Lancaster. Wd N:W: clouds &amp; sun. 22 m: very good country well enclosed &amp;
						wooded with some common interspersed. pass'd at the foot of <hi rend="italic">Farlton-Knot,</hi> a high fell. 4 m: N: of Lancaster on
						a rising ground call'd <hi rend="italic">Bolton</hi> (pron: <hi rend="italic">Bouton</hi>)-<hi rend="italic">Wait</hi> had a full view
						of <hi rend="italic">Cartmell-sands</hi> with here and there a Passenger riding over them (it being low water) the points of Furness
						shooting far into the sea, &amp; lofty mountains partly cover'd with clouds extending North of them. Lancaster also appear'd very
						conspicuous &amp; fine, for its most distinguish'd features the Castle &amp; Church, mounted on a green eminence, were all, that could
						be seen. woe is me! when I got thither, it was the second day of their fair. the Inn (in the principal street) was a great old gloomy
						house full of people, but I found tolerable quarters, &amp; even slept two nights in peace.</p>
					<p>Ascended the Castle-hill in a fine afternoon. it takes up the higher top of the eminence on wch it stands, &amp; is irregularly
						round, encompassed with a deep mote. in front towards the Town is a magnificent Gothick Gateway, lofty &amp; huge, the overhanging
						battlements are supported by a triple range of corbels, the intervals pierced thro' &amp; shewing the day from above. on its top rise
						light watchtowers of small height. it opens below with a grand pointed arch: over this is a wrought tabernacle, doubtless once
						containing the Founders figure, on one side a shield of France semy quarter'd with England, on the other the same with a label ermine
						for John of Gant D: of Lancaster. this opens to a court within, wch I did not much care to enter, being the County Gaol &amp; full of
						Prisoners, both Criminals &amp; Debtors. from this gateway the walls continue &amp; join it to a vast square tower of great height,
						the lower part at least of remote antiquity, for it has small round-headed lights with plain short pillars on each side of them, there
						is a third tower also square &amp; of less dimensions. this is all the castle, near it &amp; but little lower stands the Church, a
						large &amp; plain Gothic fabrick, the high square Tower at the West-end has been rebuilt of late years, but nearly in the same style.
						there are no ornaments of arms, &amp;c: any where to be seen. within it is lightsome &amp; spacious, but not one monument of
						antiquity, or piece of painted glass is left. from the Church-yard there is an extensive sea-view (for now the tide had almost cover'd
						the sands, &amp; fill'd the river) &amp; besides greatest part of Furness I could distinguish <hi rend="italic">Peel</hi>-Castle on
						the isle of Fowdrey,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1071tm" /> wch lies off its southern extremity. the Town is built on the slope &amp; at
						the feet of the Castle-hill more than twice the bigness of Aukland with many neat buildings of white stone, but a little disorderly in
						their position ad libitum like Kendal. many also extend below on the keys by the river-side, where a number of ships were moor'd, some
						of them three-mast vessels deck'd out with their colours in honor of the Fair. here is a good bridge of 4 arches over the <hi
							rend="italic">Lune,</hi> wch runs (when the tide is out) in two streams divided by a bed of gravel, wch is not cover'd but in
						spring-tides. below the town it widens to near the breadth of ye Thames at London, &amp; meets the sea at 5 or 6 m: distance to
						S:W:</p>
					<p>Oct: 11. Wd S:W: clouds &amp; sun. warm &amp; a fine dappled sky. cross'd the river &amp; walk'd over a peninsula 3 miles to the
						village of <hi rend="italic">Pooton</hi> wch stands on the beach. an old Fisherman mending his nets (while I enquired about the danger
						of passing those sands) told me in his dialect a moving story, how a brother of the trade, a <hi rend="italic">Cockler</hi> (as he
						styled him) driving a little cart with two daughters (women grown) in it, &amp; his Wife on horseback following, set out one day to
						pass the 7 mile sands, as they had frequently been used to do, for nobody in the village knew them better than the old Man did. when
						they were about half way over, a thick fog rose, &amp; as they advanced, they found the water much deeper than they expected. the old
						man was puzzled, he stop'd, &amp; said he would go a little way to find some mark he was acquainted with. they staid a little while
						for him, but in vain. they call'd aloud, but no reply. at last the young women press'd their mother to think, where they were, &amp;
						go on. she would not leave the place, she wander'd about forlorn &amp; amazed, she would not quit her horse, &amp; get into the cart
						with them. they determined after much time wasted to turn back, &amp; give themselves up to the guidance of their horses. the old
						Woman was soon wash'd off and perish'd. the poor Girls clung close to their cart, &amp; the horse sometimes wading &amp; sometimes
						swimming brought them back to land alive, but senseless with terror &amp; distress &amp; unable for many days to give any account of
						themselves. the bodies of their parents were found soon after;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1072tm" /> that of the Father a very few paces
						distant from the spot, where he had left them.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1073tm" />
					</p>
					<p>In the afternoon wander'd about the town &amp; by the key till it grew dark. a little rain fell. </p>
					<p>Oct: 11 [12]<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1074tm" /> Wd N:E: sky gloomy, then gleams of sunshine. set out for <hi rend="italic"
							>Settle</hi> by a fine turnpike road, 29 miles.</p>
					<p>Rich &amp; beautiful enclosed country diversified with frequent villages &amp; churches, very unequal ground, &amp; on the left the
						river Lune winding in a deep valley, its hanging banks clothed with fine woods, thro' wch you catch long reaches of the water, as the
						road winds about at a considerable height above it. pass'd the <hi rend="italic">Park</hi> (Hon: Mr Clifford's, a catholick) in the
						most picturesque part of the way. the grounds between him &amp; the river are indeed charming: the house is ordinary, &amp; the park
						nothing but a rocky fell scatter'd over with ancient hawthorns. came to <hi rend="italic">Hornby</hi> a little Town on the river
						Wanning, over wch a handsome bridge is now in building. the Castle in a lordly situation attracted me, so I walkd up the hill to it.
						first presents itself a large but ordinary white Gentleman's house sash'd. behind it rises the ancient Keep built by Edward Stanley,
						Lord Mounteagle<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1075tm" /> (inscribed Helas et quand?) he died about 1524 in Henry the 8th's time. it is now a
						shell only, tho' rafters are laid within it as for flooring. I went up a winding stone-staircase in one corner to the leads, &amp; at
						the angle is a single hexagon watch-tower rising some feet higher, fitted up in the tast of a modern <hi rend="italic">Toot</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1076tm" /> with sash-windows in gilt frames, &amp; a stucco cupola, &amp; on the top a vast gilt eagle by Mr
							<hi rend="italic">Charteris,</hi>
						<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1077tm" /> the present Possessor. but he has not lived here since the year 1745, when the people of Lancaster
						insulted him, threw stones into his coach, &amp; almost made his Wife (Lady Katherine Gordon) miscarry. since that he has built a
						great ugly house of red stone (thank God it is not in England) near Haddington, wch I remember to have pass'd by.<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.1078tm" /> he is the 2d Son of the Earl of Wemyss, &amp; brother to the Ld Elcho, Grandson to Col: Charteris,<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.1079tm" /> whose name he bears.</p>
					<p>From the leads of the Tower there is a fine view of the country round, &amp; much wood near the castle. Ingleborough, wch I had seen
						before distinctly at Lancaster to N:E: was now compleatly wrap'd in clouds all but its summit, wch might have been easily mistaken for
						a long black cloud too, fraught with an approaching storm. now our road begun gradually to mount towards the <hi rend="italic"
							>Apennine,</hi> the trees growing less, and thinner of leaves, till we came to Ingleton 18 m: it is a pretty village situated very
						high &amp; yet in a valley at the foot of that huge creature of God <hi rend="italic">Ingleborough.</hi> two torrents cross it with
						great stones roll'd along their bed instead of water: over them are two handsome arches flung. here at a little ale-house were Sr
						Bellingcam Graham<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1080tm" /> &amp; Mr Parker, Ld of ye Manour (one of them 6 feet ½ high, &amp; the other as
						much in breadth) come to dine.</p>
					<p>The nipping air (tho' the afternoon was growing very bright) now taught us, we were in Craven. the road was all up &amp; down (tho'
						no where very steep). to the left were mountain-tops (Weryside),<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1081tm" /> to the right a wide valley (all
						inclosed ground) &amp; beyond it high hills again. in approaching Settle the crags on the left drew nearer to our way, till we
						ascended <hi rend="italic">Brunton-brow,</hi> into a chearful valley (tho' thin of trees) to <hi rend="italic">Giggleswick</hi> a
						village with a small piece of water by its side cover'd over with coots. near it a Church, wch belongs also to <hi rend="italic"
							>Settle</hi> &amp; half a mile farther having passed the <hi rend="italic">Ribble</hi> over a bridge arrived at <hi rend="italic"
							>Settle.</hi> it is a small market-town standing directly under a rocky fell. there are not a dozen good-looking houses, the rest are
						old &amp; low with little wooden portico's in front. my inn pleased me much (tho' small) for the neatness &amp; civility of the good
						Woman that kept it, so I lay there two nights, &amp; went</p>
					<p>Oct: 12 [13]<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1082tm" /> to visit <hi rend="italic">Gordale-Scar.</hi> Wd N:E: day gloomy &amp; cold. it lay
						but 6 m: from Settle, but that way was directly over a Fell, &amp; it might rain, so I went round in a chaise the only way one could
						get near it in a carriage, wch made it full 13 m: &amp; half of it such a road! but I got safe over it, so there's an end, &amp; came
						to <hi rend="italic">Malham</hi> (pronounce <hi rend="italic">Maum</hi>) a village in the bosom of the mountains seated in a wild
						&amp; dreary valley. from thence I was to walk a mile over very rough ground, a torrent rattling along on the left hand. on the cliffs
						above hung a few goats: one of them danced &amp; scratched an ear with its hind-foot in a place where I would not have stood
						stock-still <q>
							<p>for all beneath the moon.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1083tm" /></p>
						</q> as I advanced the crags seem'd to close in, but discover'd a narrow entrance turning to the left between them. I followed my
						guide a few paces, &amp; lo, the hills open'd again into no large space, &amp; then all farther way is bar'd by a stream, that at the
						height of about 50 feet gushes from a hole in the rock, &amp; spreading in large sheets over its broken front dashes from steep to
						steep, &amp; then rattles away in a torrent down the valley. the rock on the left rises perpendicular with stubbed yew-trees &amp;
						shrubs, staring from its side to the height of at least 300 feet. but these are not the thing! it is that to the right, under wch you
						stand to see the fall, that forms the principal horror of the place. from its very base it begins to slope forwards over you in one
						black &amp; solid mass without any crevice in its surface, &amp; overshadows half the area below with its dreadful canopy. when I
						stood at (I believe) full 4 yards distance from its foot, the drops wch perpetually distill from its brow, fell on my head, &amp; in
						one part of the top more exposed to the weather there are loose stones that hang in air, &amp; threaten visibly some idle Spectator
						with instant destruction. it is safer to shelter yourself close to its bottom, &amp; trust the mercy of that enormous mass, wch
						nothing but an earthquake can stir. the gloomy uncomfortable day well suited the savage aspect of the place, &amp; made it still more
						formidable. I stay'd there (not without shuddering) a quarter of an hour, &amp; thought my trouble richly paid, for the impression
						will last for life. at the alehouse where I dined, in Malham, Vivares,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1084tm" /> the landscape-painter, had
						lodged for a week or more. Smith<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1085tm" /> &amp; Bellers<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1086tm" /> had also been
						there, &amp; two prints of Gordale have been engraved by them. return'd to my comfortable inn. night fine, but windy &amp; frosty.</p>
					<p>Oct: 13 [14].<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1087tm" /> Went to Skipton, 16 miles. Wd N:E: gloomy, at one o'clock a little sleet falls. from
						several parts of the road, &amp; in many places about Settle I saw at once the three famous hills of this country, Ingleborough,
						Penigent, &amp; Pendle, the first is esteem'd the highest. their features are hard to describe, but I could trace their outline with a

						<hi rend="italic">Craven</hi> after all is an unpleasing country, when seen from a height. its valleys are chiefly wide &amp; either

						of oxen with great horns. there is little cultivated ground, except a few oats.</p>
					<p>[Oct: 14. Wd N:E: gloomy. at noon a few grains of sleet fell, then bright &amp; clear. Went thro' Long-Preston &amp; Gargrave

						<hi rend="italic">Skipton</hi> [16 miles. it]<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1089tm" /> is a pretty large Market-Town in a valley with one
						very broad street gently sloping downwards from the Castle, wch stands at the head of it. this is one of our good Countesse's<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.1090tm" /> buildings, but on old foundations: it is not very large, but of a handsome antique appearance with round

						of Thanet,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1091tm" /> tho' he rarely comes thither. what with the sleet &amp; a foolish dispute about chaises,

							>Shode-bank,</hi> the steepest hill I ever saw a road carried over in England, for it mounts in a strait line (without any other
						repose for the horses, than by placing stones every now &amp; then behind the wheels) for a full mile. then the road goes on a level
						along the brow of this high hill over Rumbald-moor, till it gently descends into <hi rend="italic">Wharldale:</hi> so they call the
						Vale of the Wharf, &amp; a beautiful vale it is, well-wooded, well-cultivated, well-inhabited, but with high crags at distance, that

						in long windings the river. how it comes to pass that it should be so fine &amp; copious a stream here, &amp; at Tadcaster (so much

				<p>Never did I feel, my dear Bonstetten, to what a tedious length the few short moments of our life may be extended by impatience and
					expectation, till you had left me: nor ever knew before with so strong a conviction how much this frail body sympathizes with the
					inquietude of the mind. I am grown old in the compass of less than three weeks, like the Sultan in the Turkish Tales, that did but
					plunge his head into a vessel of water and take it out again (as the standers-by affirm'd) at the command of a Dervish, and found he
					had pass'd many years in captivity and begot a large family of children.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1127tm" /> The strength and spirits
					that now enable me to write to you, are only owing to your last letter, a temporary gleam of sunshine. Heaven knows, when it may shine
					again! I did not conceive till now (I own) what it was to lose you, nor felt the solitude and insipidity of my own condition, before I
					possess'd the happiness of your friendship.</p>
				<p>I must cite another Greek writer<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1128tm" /> to you, because it is very much to my purpose. He is describing
					the character of a Genius truly inclined to Philosophy. It includes (he says) qualifications rarely united in one single mind,
					quickness of apprehension and a retentive memory; vivacity and application, gentleness and magnanimity: to these he adds an invincible
					love of truth, and consequently of probity and justice. Such a soul (continues he) will be little inclined to sensual pleasures, and
					consequently temperate; a stranger to illiberality and avarice being accustom'd to the most extensive views of things and sublimest
					contemplations, it will contract an habitual greatness, will look down with a kind of disregard on human life and on death,
					consequently will possess the truest fortitude. Such (says he) is the Mind born to govern the rest of Mankind. But these very
					endowments so necessary to a soul form'd for philosophy are often the ruin of it (especially when join'd to the external advantages of
					wealth, nobility, strength and beauty) that is, if it light on a bad soil; and want its proper nurture, which nothing but an excellent
					education can bestow. In this case he is depraved by the publick example, the assemblies of the people, the courts of justice, the
					theatres, that inspire it with false opinions, terrify it with false infamy, or elevate it with false applause: and remember, that
					extraordinary vices and extraordinary virtues are alike the produce of a vigorous Mind: little souls are alike incapable of the one or
					the other. </p>
				<p>If you have ever met with the portrait sketch'd out by Plato, you will know it again: for my part (to my sorrow) I have had that
					happiness: I see the principal features, and I foresee the dangers with a trembling anxiety. But enough of this, I return to your
					letter: it proves at least, that in the midst of your new gaieties, I still hold some place in your memory, and (what pleases me above
					all) it has an air of undissembled sincerity. Go on, my best and amiable Friend, to shew me your heart simply and without the shadow of
					disguise, and leave me to weep over it (as I now do) no matter whether from joy or sorrow. </p>

				<p>I thought my mysteries<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1140tm" /> were but too easy to explain, however you must have a little patience, for I
					can hazard only word of mouth. what you say of poor B: is so true, &amp; (let me add) expresses so well my own feelings, that I shall

					this time I should think, you may have received a letter from him yourself, for in that I received from Abbeville, 31 March, he spoke
					of his intention to write to you. I wrote to you myself as soon as I return'd from London, the 1st (I think) of April.<anchor

				</p>
				<p>I am coming to see you, my good Friend, that is, on Monday se'nnight I mean to call on Palgrave<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1143tm" /> for
					a few days in my way to Blundeston. as to Wales you may do with me, what you please, I care not. there is this inconvenience in our
					way, that I must call on Mason at Aston (&amp; so may you too) for a little while, the last week in May:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1144tm"
					 /> from thence we strike across to Chester, &amp; enter Wales.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1145tm" /> for the summer of next year (tho' I
					shall be dead first) I am your Man, only I desire it may be a secret between ourselves, till the time comes, as you love your life.</p>
				<p>I rejoice to see, you are so great a Gardiner &amp; Botanist: my instructions will be very poor: De B: with five lessons from
						Miller<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1146tm" /> (before he departed for Sumatra) &amp; his own matchless industry, could have told you much
					more than I can. it would be strange if I should blame you for reading Isocrates. I did so myself 20 years ago, &amp; in an edition at
					least as bad as yours. the <hi rend="italic">Panegyrick,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">De Pace, Areopagitic,</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic"
						>Advice to Philip,</hi> are by far the noblest remains we have of this Writer, &amp; equal to most things extant in the Greek tongue:
					but it depends on your judgement to distinguish between his real &amp; occasional opinion of things, as he directly contradicts in one
					place what he has advanced in another, for example in the <hi rend="italic">Panathenaic</hi> &amp; the <hi rend="italic">De Pace,</hi>
					&amp;c: on the naval power of Athens: the latter of the two is undoubtedly his own undisguised sentiment.</p>
				<p>Talk your fill to me, &amp; spare not. it would perhaps be more flattering, if you lived in the midst of an agreable society: but
					even as it is, I take it in good part, &amp; heartily thank you, for you have given me a late instance of your partiality &amp;
					kindness, that I shall ever remember. </p>
				<p>I received on ye 10th of this month a long letter from Paris lively &amp; sensible as usual: but you will see it, &amp; I shall hope
					for a sight of such as you have got by you. there are two different directions. A Mons: M:r B: <hi rend="italic">a l'hotel de
						Luxembourg, rue des Petits Augustins, Fauxbourg St Germain, Paris.</hi> the other, to the same, <hi rend="italic">chez Messrs</hi>
					<hi rend="italic">Lullin, Freres, &amp; Rittiel, rue Thevenot, Paris.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1147tm" /> the latter seems the safer, but then I am uncertain, whether I read it right. what shall I do? I
					have tried both ways, but do not know yet with what success.</p>

					begun to collect, or the observations I had made on them. a sketch of the division &amp; arrangement of the subject however I venture
					to transcribe, and would wish to know, whether it corresponds in any thing with your own plan, for I am told your first volume is
					already in the press.</p>
				<p rendition="#center">INTRODUCTION</p>
				<p>On the poetry of the <hi rend="italic">Galic</hi> (or Celtic) nations, as far back as it can be traced.</p>
				<p>On that of the Goths: its introduction into these islands by the Saxons &amp; Danes, &amp; its duration. on the origin of rhyme among
					the Franks, the Saxons, &amp; Provençaux. some account of the Latin rhyming poetry from its early origin down to the 15th Century. </p>
				<p rendition="#center">P: 1</p>
				<p>On the School of Provence, wch rose about the year 1100, &amp; was soon followed by the French &amp; Italians. their heroic poetry,
					or romances in verse, Allegories, fabliaux, syrvientes, comedies, farces, canzoni, sonnets, balades, madrigals, sestines, &amp;c: </p>
				<p>Of their imitators the <hi rend="italic">French,</hi> &amp; of the first <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> School (commonly call'd the
					Sicilian) about the year 1200 brought to perfection by Dante, Petrarch, Boccace, &amp; others.</p>
				<p>State of Poetry in England from the Conquest (1066) or rather from Henry 2d's time (1154) to the reign of Edward the 3d (1327). </p>
				<p rendition="#center">P: 2</p>
				<p>On <hi rend="italic">Chaucer</hi> who first introduced the manner of the Provençaux improved by the Italians into our country. his
					character &amp; merits at large; the different kinds in wch he excell'd. Gower, Occleve, Lydgate, Hawes, G: Douglas, Lindsay,
					Bellenden, Dunbar, &amp;c: </p>
				<p rendition="#center">P: 3</p>
				<p>Second Italian School (of Ariosto, Tasso, &amp;c:) an improvement on the first, occasion'd by the revival of letters the end of the
					15th century. The lyric poetry of this &amp; the former age introduced from Italy by Ld Surrey, Sr T. Wyat, Bryan, Ld Vaux, &amp;c: in
					the beginning of the 16th century. </p>
				<p>
					<hi rend="italic">Spenser,</hi> his character. Subject of his poem allegoric &amp; romantic, of Provençal invention: but his manner of
						[treating]<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1152tm" /> it borrow'd from the Second Italian School. Drayton, Fairfax, Phin: Fletcher, Golding,
					Phaer, &amp;c: this school ends in Milton.</p>
				<p>A <hi rend="italic">third Italian</hi> School, full of conceit, begun in Q: Elizabeths reign, continued under James, &amp; Charles

					<salute>My dear Sr </salute>

				<p>I have been sincerely anxious for Miss Wharton, whose illness must have been indeed severe, if she is only now recovering. let us
					hope everything from the spring, wch begins (tho' slowly) to give new life to all things, &amp; pray give my best respects to her,
					&amp; thanks for remembring me &amp; my dictionary at a time, when she well may be excused for thinking of nothing but herself. </p>
				<p>I have utterly forgot, where my journal<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1156tm" /> left off, but (I think) it was after the account of <hi
						rend="italic">Gordale</hi> near Settle. if so, there was little more worth your notice: the principal things were <hi rend="italic"
						>Wharldale</hi> in the way from Skipton to Ottley, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Kirstall-Abbey</hi> 3 mile from Leedes. the first is the
					valley form'd by the River Wharf, well-cultivated, well-inhabited, well-wooded, but with high rocky crags at distance, that border the
					green country on either hand: thro' the midst of it runs the river in long windings deep, clear, &amp; full to the brink, and of no
					inconsiderable breadth. how it comes to be so fine &amp; copious a stream here, &amp; at Tadcaster (so much lower) should have nothing
					but a wide stony channel with little or no water, I cannot tell you. <hi rend="italic">Kirstall</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1157tm" /> is a noble ruin in the Semi-Saxon style of building, as old as K: Stephen toward the end of his
					reign, 1152. the whole Church is still standing (the roof excepted) seated in a delicious quiet valley on the banks of the river <hi
						rend="italic">Are,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1158tm" /> &amp; preserved with religious reverence by the Duke of Montagu.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1159tm" />
					adjoining to the church between that &amp; the river are variety of chappels &amp; remnants of the abbey, shatter'd by the
					encroachments of the ivy, &amp; surmounted by many a sturdy tree, whose twisted roots break thro' the fret of the vaulting, &amp; hang
					streaming from the roofs. the gloom of these ancient cells, the shade &amp; verdure of the landscape, the glittering &amp; murmur of
					the stream, the lofty towers &amp; long perspectives of the Church, in the midst of a clear bright day, detain'd me for many hours
					&amp; were the truest subjects for my glass<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1160tm" /> I have yet met with any where. as I lay at that smoky
					ugly busy town of Leedes, I drop'd all farther thoughts of my journal, &amp; after passing two days at Mason's (tho' he was
						absent)<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1161tm" /> pursued my way by Nottingham, Leicester, Harborough, Kettering, Thrapston, &amp; Huntington
					to Cambridge, where I arrived, 22 Oct:, having met with no rain to signify, till this last day of my journey. there's luck for you!</p>
				<p>I do think of seeing Wales this summer,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1162tm" /> having never found my spirits lower than at present, &amp;
					feeling that motion &amp; change of the scene is absolutely necessary to me. I will make Aston in my way to Chester, &amp; shall
					rejoice to meet you there the <hi rend="italic">last week in May;</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1163tm" /> Mason writes me word, that he wishes it, &amp; tho' his old house is down &amp; his new one not up,
					proposes to receive us like Princes in grain.</p>

				<p>Alas! how do I every moment feel the truth of what I have somewhere read: <hi rend="italic">Ce n'est pas le voir que de s'en
						souvenir,</hi> and yet that remembrance is the only satisfaction I have left. My life now is but a perpetual conversation with your
					shadow.&#x2013;The known sound of your voice still rings in my ears.&#x2013;There, on the corner of the fender you are standing, or
					tinkling on the Pianoforte, or stretch'd at length on the sofa.&#x2013;Do you reflect, my dearest Friend, that it is a week or eight
					days, before I can receive a letter from you and as much more before you can have my answer, that all that time (with more than
					Herculean toil) I am employ'd in pushing the tedious hours along, and wishing to annihilate them; the more I strive, the heavier they
					move and the longer they grow. I can not bear this place, where I have spent many tedious years within less than a month, since you
					left me. I am going for a few days to see poor Nicholls invited by a letter, wherein he mentions you in such terms, as add to my regard
					for him, and express my own sentiments better than I can do myself.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1165tm" /> 'I am concern'd (says he) that I
					can not pass my life with him, I never met with any one that pleased and suited me so well: the miracle to me is, how he comes to be so
					little spoil'd, and the miracle of miracles will be, if he continues so in the midst of every danger and seduction, and without any
					advantages, but from his own excellent nature and understanding. I own, I am very anxious for him on this account, and perhaps your
					inquietude may have proceeded from the same cause. I hope, I am to hear, when he has pass'd that cursed sea, or will he forget me thus
						<hi rend="italic">in insulam relegatum</hi>? If he should, it is out of my power to retaliate.'</p>
				<p>Sure you have wrote to him, my dear Bonstetten, or sure you will! he has moved me with these gentle and sensible expressions of his
					kindness for you. Are you untouch'd by them? </p>
				<p>You do me the credit (and false or true, it goes to my heart) of ascribing to me your love for many virtues of the highest rank.
					Would to heaven it were so; but they are indeed the fruits of your own noble and generous understanding, that has hitherto struggled
					against the stream of custom, passion, and ill company, even when you were but a Child, and will you now give way to that stream, when
					your strength is increased? Shall the Jargon of French Sophists, the allurements of painted women <hi rend="italic">comme il faut,</hi>
					or the vulgar caresses of prostitute beauty, the property of all, that can afford to purchase it, induce you to give up a mind and body
					by Nature distinguish'd from all others to folly, idleness, disease, and vain remorse? Have a care, my ever-amiable Friend, <hi
						rend="italic">of loving, what you do not approve,</hi> and know me for your most faithful and most humble Despote.</p>

					<salute>Sir, </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>I am infinitely obliged to you for the Favour of your Letter.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1167tm" /> Your Plan for the <hi rend="italic"
						>History of English Poetry</hi> is admirably constructed; and much improved from an Idea of Pope,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1168tm" />
					which Mr Mason obligingly sent me by Application from our Friend Dr Hurd. I regrett that a writer of your consummate Taste should not
					have executed it.</p>
				<p>Although I have not followed this Plan, yet it is of great service to me, and throws much light on many of my Periods, by giving
					connected views and Details. I begin with such an introduction, or general Dissertation, as you had intended: viz. on the Northern
					Poetry with its introduction into England by the Danes and Saxons, &amp; its duration. I then begin my <hi rend="italic">History</hi>
					at the conquest which I write chronologically in Sections; and continue, as matter successively offers itself, in a series of regular
					Annals, down to &amp; beyond the Restoration. I think with you, that Dramatic poetry is detached from the idea of my work,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1169tm" /> that it requires a separate consideration, &amp; will swell the size of my book beyond all bounds. One of
					my Sections, a very large one, is entirely on Chaucer, and exactly fills your Title of <hi rend="italic">Part Second.</hi> In the
					course of my Annals I consider collaterally the Poetry of different Nations as influencing our own. What I have at present finished
					ends with the section on Chaucer, &amp; will almost make my first Volume; for I design two Volumes in quarto. This first Volume will
					soon be in the press.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1170tm" /> I should have said before, that although I proceed chronologically, yet I often
					stand still to give some general view, as perhaps of a <hi rend="italic">particular species</hi> of poetry, &amp;c. and even <hi
						rend="italic">anticipate</hi> sometimes for this purpose. These <hi rend="italic">views</hi> often form <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
					Section; yet are interwoven into the Tenor of the work without interrupting my historical series. In this respect, some of my Sections
					have the effect of your <hi rend="italic">Parts</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Divisions.</hi>
				</p>
				<p>You do me a favour in requesting me to pay an attention to Mr Stiguer.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1171tm" /> I return to Oxford in a few
					Days, when I will make it my business to find him out, and to introduce him according to your wishes. I do not know his College, nor
					have I heard of his name. But he will easily be found out. </p>
				<p>I cannot take my Leave without declaring, that my strongest incitement to prosecute the <hi rend="italic">History of English
						Poetry</hi> is the pleasing hope of being approved by you; whose <hi rend="italic">true genius</hi> I so justly venerate, and whose
						<hi rend="italic">genuine Poetry</hi> has ever given me such sincere pleasure.</p>

					<salute> Dear Sir </salute>
				</opener>
				<p> I troubled You with a letter some months ago,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1174tm" /> enclosing a specimen of a Poem,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1175tm" /> which I have some thoughts of finishing when I find myself at leisure.&#x2014;The design of this, is to
					solicit Your acceptance of a Book called An Essay on Truth<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1176tm" /> which M<hi rend="super">r</hi>
						Dilly<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1177tm" /> Bookseller in London sends You by my desire. It is not such a present as I wish to make, but
					it is the best that is now in my power. You will think perhaps that I am very anxious to become a voluminous Author; but that is not
					the case. The present publication is the consequence of necessity rather than choice. I expect neither praise nor profit from it; nay,
					though it were to be succesful, which I am confident cannot happen, my vanity would not be flattered in the least; for I set no value
					on such performances. The occasion of my writing it was this. The business of my profession obliged me, when I first entered upon it,
					to be more conversant than I could have wished with our modern moral &amp; metaphysical writers. I had little relish for them from the
					first, and as I began to understand them better, I hated and despised them the more. Their principles and method of investigation
					seemed to me to be equally unfavourable to Science virtue and good taste. I saw with concern, that the Publick in general, and the
					people of this country in particular, were every day growing more and more attached to them; and I also saw, or thought I saw, that
					those who admired them most, understood them the least. I used to express myself on this subject with so little reserve in my Publick
					Lectures, that some degree of curiosity was excited in the small circle where I am known; and I found it was become necessary for me,
					if I would clear myself of the imputation of being a mere Declaimer and retailer of paradoxes, to publish my sentiments at large, with
					the grounds of them. This is what I have endeavoured to do in the book which now craves the honour of Your acceptance; I have not the
					face to add&#x2014;and of Your perusal, for I should really be sorry to see You so ill employed, as in the study of a metaphysical
					controversy. Besides I know, that in England Metaphysick has not got such a footing as with us. Whether it be owing to the attachment
					which many among us have to a Countryman,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1178tm" /> or to something of a minute and sophistical spirit in the
					genius of our people, I know not; but certain it is, that we Scots are at present much inclined to be scepticks and metaphysicians.
					Every body here who can read, reads metaphysick, our writers write it, and our parsons preach it.&#x2014;If You should at any time do
					my book the honour to look into it, may I hope that You will favour me with Your opinion of the Style: As to the doctrine, I dare say
					we are of the same mind. The style falls far short of my idea of good English: it is often stiff and pedantick in spite of all my
					endeavours to the contrary. I have indeed studied perspicuity more than elegance; because I know that my doctrine will be most
					favourably received by those who understand it best. I have frequently given a little into declamation, and something of a flippant
					drollery, both which I know are unsuitable to a philosophical enquiry. I did this, partly to amuse myself, and partly to [render
						m]y<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1179tm" /> subject not altogether unentertaining.</p>
				<p> [In my l]ast I complained of bad health; I am no[w] much [better], and should be glad to hear that You a[re] well and happy.</p>

					Switzerland, is infinitely acceptable. It feels too pleasing ever to be fulfill'd, and as often as I read over your truly kind letter,

				<p>Why you will not write I can't guess,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1214tm" /> because if you recollect I was to wait your more certain
					direction before I wrote to Bonstetten.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1215tm" /> I have not heard from him, but that only serves to make me
					obstinate; I do not so easily give up, or suffer myself to be given up by a person whom I think worth my esteem. I have had an answer
					from the bishop<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1216tm" /> (for he is determined to shew me that he thinks a gentleman entitled to an answer)
					most civil in terms, but most uncivil in fact, for preach<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1217tm" /> I must; indeed I had no other expectation.
					It is not however about my own foolish concerns that I write now. I have this moment received the enclosed from poor Temple, and have
					been as irresolute and full of doubts whether to send it all, or transcribe from it, as I am every day about the Genera of Linnæus. You
					will see best from his own words what he wants, and I am sure you will feel his situation; any instance of attention and kindness from
					you will be a medicine to his distress; his spirits require to be raised, and I know nothing so likely to raise them; if you should
					write yourself it would be an act of charity indeed! he has no other refuge or consolation than his books, when his mind is unbent from
					that attention it sinks into despair. In short his letter is too faithful a portrait of his mind, and I send it you because I think you
					are interested in his fate. What must I say to him about that resolution of separating which he seems to speak of seriously?<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1218tm" /> Will it pass off of itself? or should I dissuade it? or what can it mean? separating only from her bed?
					that will be a source of perpetual ill-humours and misery, if not impossible. as for any other separation how can he possibly afford
					that? I should scruple to have sent you the letter if I were not conscious to myself of acting from motives of the truest friendship. I
					would do the best, but am quite at a loss. I am sure your heart will prompt you to advise me.</p>
				<p>I fear you are on your journey to Yorkshire,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1219tm" /> but I trust this will be safely conveyed to you. I
					shall however for fear of accidents blot out names&#x2013;the direction, if you will write yourself, is near Chudleigh.<anchor

				<p>I rejoice to hear that you are restored to a better state of health, to your books, and to your muse once again.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1247tm" /> That forced dissipation and exercise we are obliged to fly to as a remedy, when this frail machine goes
					wrong, is often almost as bad as the distemper we would cure; yet I too have been constrained of late to pursue a like regimen, on
					account of certain pains in the head (a sensation unknown to me before), and of great dejection of spirits. This, Sir, is the only
					excuse I have to make you for my long silence, and not (as perhaps you may have figured to yourself) any secret reluctance I had to
					tell you my mind concerning the specimen you so kindly sent me of your new Poem.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1248tm" /> On the contrary, if
					I had seen anything of importance to disapprove, I should have hastened to inform you, and never doubted of being forgiven. The truth
					is, I greatly like all I have seen, and wish to see more. The design is simple, and pregnant with poetical ideas of various kinds, yet
					seems somehow imperfect at the end. Why may not young Edwin, when necessity has driven him to take up the harp, and assume the
					profession of a Minstrel, do some great and singular service to his country? (what service I must leave to your invention) such as no
					General, no Statesman, no Moralist could do without the aid of music, inspiration, and poetry. This will not appear an improbability in
					those early times, and in a character then held sacred, and respected by all nations. Besides, it will be a full answer to all the
					Hermit has said, when he dissuaded him from cultivating these pleasing arts; it will shew their use, and make the best panegyrick of
					our favourite and celestial science. And lastly, (what weighs most with me) it will throw more of action, pathos, and interest into
					your design, which already abounds in reflection and sentiment. As to description, I have always thought that it made the most graceful
					ornament of poetry, but never ought to make the subject. Your ideas are new, and borrowed from a mountainous country, the only one that
					can furnish truly picturesque scenery. Some trifles in the language or versification you will permit me to remark. </p>
				<p>[ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1249tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I will not enter at present into the merits of your <hi rend="italic">Essay on Truth,</hi> because I have not yet given it all the
					attention it deserves, though I have read it through with pleasure; besides I am partial; for I have always thought David Hume<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1250tm" /> a pernicious writer, and believe he has done as much mischief here as he has in his own country. A turbid
					and shallow stream often appears to our apprehensions very deep. A professed sceptic can be guided by nothing but his present passions
					(if he has any) and interests; and to be masters of his philosophy we need not his books or advice, for every child is capable of the
					same thing, without any study at all. Is not that <hi rend="italic">naiveté</hi> and good humour, which his admirers celebrate in him,
					owing to this, that he has continued all his days an infant, but one that unhappily has been taught to read and write? That childish
					nation, the French, have given him vogue and fashion, and we, as usual, have learned from them to admire him at second hand.</p>

				</opener>
				<p> It happen'd, that I was in London at the time, when St:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1252tm" /> received your letter relating to Mr. L:s
					request. as my name was mention'd in it, I ought to make my excuses to you as well as he, wch it is indeed easy to do, as I could by no
					means ask any thing but thro' him, &amp; (tho' this had been in my power) it would have been a very bad plea to say, my Ld, you have
					done me a very unexpected favour not long since; &amp; therefore I must beg you to do another at my desire for a Friend of mine. but
					the truth is, at this time our application could not have had any success, as our Principal would certainly never apply to three
					different Persons, with whom he has no connection; nor care to be refused, or even obliged by them. the inside of things can not be
					well explain'd by letters; but if you saw it, you would immediately see in its full light the impracticability of the thing.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1253tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I am lately return'd<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1254tm" /> from a six weeks ramble thro' Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Monmouthsh:re
					Herefordsh:re &amp; Shropshire, five of the most beautiful counties in the kingdom. the very light, &amp; principal feature in my
					journey was the river <hi rend="italic">Wye,</hi> wch I descended in a boat for near 40 miles from Ross to Chepstow: its banks are a
					succession of nameless wonders: one out of many you may see not ill described by Mr. Whateley<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1255tm" /> in his
						<hi rend="italic">Observations on Gardening</hi> under the name of the <hi rend="italic">New-Weir</hi>: he has also touch'd upon two
					others, <hi rend="italic">Tinterne-Abbey,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Persfield</hi> (Mr Morris's).<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1256tm" />
					both of them famous scenes; &amp; both on the Wye. Monmouth, a town I never heard mention'd, lies on the same river in a vale, that is
					the delight of my eyes, &amp; the very seat of pleasure. the vale of Abergavenny, Ragland &amp; Chepstow-Castles, Ludlow,
					Malvern-hills, Hampton Court near Lemster,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1257tm" /> the Leasowes,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1258tm" />
						Hagley,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1259tm" /> the three Cities &amp; their Cathedrals,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1260tm" /> &amp; lastly
						Oxford<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1261tm" /> (where I past two days in my return with great satisfaction), are the rest of my
					acquisitions, &amp; no bad harvest to my thinking. I have a journal written by the companion<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1262tm" /> of my
					travels, that serves to recall &amp; fix the fading images of these things.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1263tm" /></p>

					so severely; but suspect, it is owing to a little indolence &amp; want of motion between the fits, as I have lately heard you complain
					of a tenderness in your feet, that would not let you walk as usual. Man is a creature made to be jumbled, &amp; no matter whether he
					goes on his head or heels, move or be moved he must. I am convinced, I owe my late &amp; present ease to the little expeditions I
					always make in summer. the smartness of the pain you undergo, is an undoubted sign of strength &amp; <hi rend="italic">youth,</hi>
					&amp; the sooner it will be over. I know, this is poor comfort: but I flatter myself, that in some few days you will be at ease, &amp;
					will have the good nature to tell me so.</p>

				<p>I do not see, why you should suppose that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> only are to have the privilege of being ill. for me, from the
					time you left me (till within these three days) I have been only one day out of the walls of this college. that day was employ'd in
					going to the Hills<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1317tm" /> by way of airing after the gout, &amp; in catching such a cold &amp; cough as has
					given me no rest night or day, &amp; has only now taken its leave of me. I sent away your letter to B: directly: I saw no reason
					against it. he was then at Aubonne near Geneva with his Brother, &amp; is now at Berne. the picture<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1318tm" />
					is not arrived, nor (I suppose) ever will; tho' he says, he has sent it, but by what conveyance, or by what hand he does not say.</p>
				<p>You do me wrong: I have thought very frequently of you, &amp; especially since Sr A: Allen's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1319tm" /> death.
					I am rather glad his family were about him, tho' I know not well why, for he perhaps was insensible to it. these sort of deaths are
					alarming to the Spectator; but perhaps the best for the Sufferer. I have now every day before my eyes a Woman of ninety, my
						Aunt,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1320tm" /> who has for many years been gradually turning into chalk-stones: they are making their way out
					of the joints of both feet, &amp; the Surgeon twice a day comes to increase the torture. she is just as sensible &amp; as impatient of
					pain, &amp; as intractable as she was 60 years ago. she thinks not at all of death, &amp; if a mortification does not come to release
					her, may lie in this agony for months (at least) helpless &amp; bed-rid. this is what you call a <hi rend="italic">natural</hi>
					death!</p>
				<p>It is well, you live in a dry country, but do not your lakes<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1321tm" /> overflow? can any thing get from

				<p>God forbid that I should claim to myself the privilege you mention. That fool, young S&#x2014;, at his return from Cambridge, told me
					that you had been perfectly well some time, which, of course, relieved me from all anxiety on that account. What a blessing it is to
					have a galloping imagination: I fancied you in town, with people whom you loved better, or who at least engrossed you for the time,
					hearing news, or bad operas, amused, in short, and quite thoughtless of me in my hermitage. But you was in flannel too, so I beg your
					pardon. </p>
				<p>I have returned to reading a little since my pain left me; I have run through eight centuries of Christianity in Mosheim.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1325tm" /> I am pleased with the good sense, judgment, and impartiality of the author, and with his plain manly stile;
					but that this should be a history of religion, that Monothelites, and Monophysites, and Stylites should think they were doing God
					service is wonderful! Simeon,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1326tm" /> a Syrian, was founder of the last sect, he was first a shepherd and
					then a monk, and built himself five columns, one of six cubits high, the next twelve, the next twenty-two, another thirty-six, and the
					last forty; and on these he passed thirty-seven years of his life, advancing in a progressive state upwards towards heaven. Then the
					pride and power of bishops, growing out of an humble and laborious office, totally different in its nature and intention! Patriarchs
					lording it over these, and the 'gran verme'<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1327tm" /> at last devouring all. New doctrines invented every day,
					and propagated like the religion of Mahomet. The passions of men hurrying them out of sight of the true object of contention. All this,
					and thousand times more that I forget (thank Heaven) as fast as I read it, makes me wish myself at the last page; when the Reformation
						<hi rend="italic">commence à éclore,</hi> I shall apply myself to Burnet,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1328tm" /> in hopes of learning a
					little profane history to mix with my divine, which is really a bad mess by itself. I think that there is less inconvenience, after
					all, in believing as one's nurse bids one, than in resolving to understand and explain to all the world what reason was never meant to
					meddle with. 'Illa enim (says Mosheim, speaking of the fifth century,) primæ ætatis Christianæ sancta et veneranda simplicitas, quæ Deo
					loquenti credere, et mandanti obedire jubebat, præcipuis horum temporum doctoribus agrestis videbatur.' But Mosheim and Homer and all
					is at a stand now, or obliged at least to make room for Froissart.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1329tm" /> In the evening I read Rapin<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1330tm" /> to my mother; so being come to Edward the Third, I took up Froissart, to keep pace with the other, and am
					so delighted that I read nothing else, 'et ay-je tant chevauché par mes journées,' that I am arrived at the peace of Bretigny.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1331tm" /> He is my historian, for he tells me all that he knows, and tells for the sake of telling, and forgets
					himself to talk of other people; which I believe is never the case for a single moment with our modern historians, who all write for
					vanity or profit, and betray their design; there is something so very appreté in all of them, and so very much the contrary in him. If
					it is owing to the simplicity of the age, and if it would not suit with the present times, I am sorry for it, for I like it much
					better. What a miserable state was France in when their king<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1332tm" /> was a prisoner in England, when English
					garrisons lived at discretion in all parts of the kingdom, English armies spread desolation through every part of it, and the
						Jaquerie,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1333tm" /> to complete their misery, raged everywhere without control! I want to know whether you do
					not think Edward the First and Edward the Third's pretensions to Scotland very unjust, and a stain to their characters, when one
					considers the mischiefs they caused? and whether you think Edward the Third's pretensions to the crown of France, and the torrents of
					blood that were shed to support them, give a real lustre to his reign? and whether it was a worthy action to protest in private against
					the King of France and his title, and yet do him public homage? My brave Lord Herbert of Cherbury<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1334tm" />
					would have [ ]<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1335tm" /></p>
				<p>My friend Dr. Warner,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1336tm" /> and his very amiable wife, with Miss Allin,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1337tm" />
					are gone this day to attempt the London road. The Dr. is prudent, and will not willingly drown himself and them; but the Yarmouth
					coach, when it has gone at all, has gone with eight horses and four postilions. A waggon and coach were overset in the water at
						Ixworth<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1338tm" /> near Bury, but no mischief done. The marshes which I see from my bedchamber window are
					become an ocean. I have heard from Clarke,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1339tm" /> who has been these five months at Kylmarnock in Ayrshire,
					and stays five more: from Wheeler,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1340tm" /> who has been at Bath with his old haridan again. I have besides
					received a silly letter from Mr. Wilson, and a polite one from Dr. Gisburne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1341tm" /> apologizing for not
					seeing me before he left Richmond, &amp;c. I have heard of Temple, who has sold some of his estate, got rid of some vexation,<anchor

				<p>I want to know a hundred things about you. are you fix'd in your house, for I hear many vague reports of Miss A:s<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1353tm" /> inclination to part with the estate, &amp; that the <hi rend="italic">Loves</hi> are desirous of the
					purchase, &amp; would bid high? what part of the mansion (where I used to tremble at a breath of air) was blown down in the high wind?
					did not you bless your stars for that dreary flat, that lay between you &amp; Corton,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1354tm" /> &amp; bar'd all
					sight of the sea in its fury, &amp; of the numberless wrecks, that strew'd all your coast? as to our little &amp; unpicturesque events
					you know them, I find, &amp; have congratulated Mr Presendent,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1355tm" /> who is now our Master,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1356tm" /> in due form: but you do not know, that it never rains but it pours: he goes to Town on Monday for
					institution to the Living of Streatham<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1357tm" /> in the Isle of Ely worth from two to three hundred pound
					a-year &amp; given him by the King's Majesty. the detail is infinite, the attacks, the defences, the evasions, the circumventions, the
					sacrifices, the perjuries, are only to be told by word of mouth: suffice it to say, that it is carried swimmingly &amp; triumphantly
					against two Lords temporal &amp; one spiritual,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1358tm" /> who sollicited for their several Protegés in vain: so
					our good Uncle Toby will have about 400£ a-year, no uncomfortable pittance! I have had several capricious letters from Berne. he has
					sent me some pretty views of his native country, &amp; its inhabitants. the portrait<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1359tm" /> too is arrived
					done at Paris, but no more like <hi rend="italic">than I to Hercules:</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1360tm" /> you would think, it was intended for his Father, so grave &amp; so composed: doubtless he meant to
					look, like an Englishman or an owl. pray send me the letter,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1361tm" /> &amp; do not suppose I grudge
					postage.</p>
				<p>I rejoice you have met with Froissart:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1362tm" /> he is the Herodotus of a barbarous age. had he but had the
					luck of writing in as good a language, he might have been immortal! his locomotive disposition (for then there was no other way of
					learning things) his simple curiosity, his religious credulity, were much like those of the old Grecian. our Ancestors used to read the
					Mort d'Arthur,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1363tm" /> Amadis de Gaul,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1364tm" /> &amp; Froissart, all alike, that is,

				<p>If you knew the pleasure your letters give me, I think you would not be quite so stingy of them, in four months I have only been able
					to squeeze two from you, and I suspect that I owe this last in some degree to your desire of seeing De Bonstetten's to me;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1372tm" /> if that is the case the end is answered, for I received yours yesterday and send it enclosed to day. I
					answered it only yesterday; I told him 'that I believed what he said, because he said it, and because in such a case I had infinitely
					rather be a dupe than too mistrustful.' I said not a word about Berne,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1373tm" /> for I am entirely ignorant of
					your intentions, I only know that it will be impossible for me to get either money or a curate at a moment's warning. What may be my
					situation too at the time I am uncertain; at present the matter stands thus. Miss Allin has, whether she lets or sells this house and
					estate, promised me the refusal. Mr. Love however, I hear from common report only, (but it is very likely) is trying to make a bargain
					for himself; that this will have no other effect than perhaps raising the price I am clear, for Miss Allin has honour enough, and I
					believe regard enough for me as a neighbour and friend of her father's, to use me at least fairly, but this you'll say will not prevent
					her agents from consulting her interest by selling her estate for as much as they can get. I suppose not, and therefore, if they ask
					any extravagant price, and I had the money to give, Mr. Love should have it. As for the house, it is worth little, I question even its
					safety; so that, if I bought it dear, and then had to pull down and rebuild, to add or alter, or at least to make great repairs, I
					should soon have spent all I have, and all I expect, and be condemned for want of sixpence in my pocket to live in this desert all the
					days of my life. If it were to be bought cheap, and I was sure that the house would stand as it does or require but little expense in
					repairs or alteration, and my uncles<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1374tm" /> would advance the purchase money, it would be worth having. Or
					if Miss Allin would let me a lease of it not for a very long term. Hitherto all I have done is to obtain Miss Allin's promise,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1375tm" /> through Dr. Warner (for she was incapable of seeing any one when she left Somerly)<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1376tm" /> that as soon as any thing is determined with respect to this estate I shall have the first notice. I wrote
					to my eldest uncle to say so, and remain now at quiet, and leave Mr. Love to use his little arts as he pleases. There's an end of my
					tiresome story! but you asked me, and I have bestowed it all on you. </p>
				<p>I am so glad that you speak so handsomely of my Beaumaistre Messire Jehan. He is indeed the Herodotus of a barbarous age.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1377tm" /> I beg, if you will not allow him to be immortal, that you will grant him yet many a good century to come of
					life and fame. I want to know who he was, I design to gather together all that is scattered about his book relating to himself; viz. at
					whose request he wrote the different parts of his work, where he travelled, by whom he was patronized, and how he got his information,
					&amp;c. but after all, who was he? He seems to have been of some considerable rank, and much considered, whether on that account or on
					account of 'çeste noble et haute histoire,' I know not. When Messire Espaing de Lyon and he travelled together from Carcassonne to the
					E. of Foix's court at Ortais<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1378tm" /> in Bearn, they appear to be on terms of equality and familiarity, and
					Messire Espaing de Lyon was I find on all occasions one of the principal Chevaliers belonging to the Comte de Foix, who was celebrated
					for the state and grandeur in which he lived; by the Earl himself he was very well received, and kept his Christmas at Ortais as his
					guest, when prelates and hauts Barons en grande Foison were there too; from thence he went in the train of the E&#x2013;'s young
						niece,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1379tm" /> who was going to be married to the old D. of Berri. In the title page of my (Preston's) book
					is written in a bad French hand after his name, tresorier et chanoine degimay<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1380tm" /> et delisle, does that
					imply an ecclesiastic or secular person? or what was a chanoine? I have more questions to ask if you will take the trouble of answering
					them. What were men at arms? were they always persons of superior rank, as they seem generally to have been? were they better armed
					than the rest? had they a stated number of attendants, or did it vary, which I rather think? were those attendants armed and ranked in
					the army, and so reckoned as part of its strength, or only followers for pomp and convenience? I dont know exactly what an escuyer was,
					but at least a gentleman he must have been, for I find them encountering with knights at justs.</p>
				<p>It is astonishing how much better I understand French of the fourteenth than English of the sixteenth century; I want you every
					moment for an interpreter in reading Hall's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1381tm" /> account of the Camp of the Cloth of Gold.</p>
				<p>I think nothing can be a stronger instance of the advantage the simple style of a cotemporary has over the polished periods of a
					later writer, than the dying words of Douglas,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1382tm" /> who was killed in a battle near Newcastle, between the
					Scotch and English, anno 1388, related by Froissart, and translated by Buchanan.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1383tm" /> As he lay pierced
					with many mortal wounds; 'Messire Jehan de Sainct Cler<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1384tm" /> demanda au Comte, Cousin comment vous va?
					Petitement, dit le Comte. Loué en soit Dieu. Il n'est guères de mes ancesseurs qui soient morts en chambres ne sur licts. Je vous dy,
					Pensez de moi vanger: car je me compte pour mort. Le cueur me faut trop souvent, redrecez ma bannière, et criez Douglas: mais ne dites
					à amy, nà ennemy que je soye au party ou vous me voyez: car mes ennemis (s'ils le scavoient) s'en reconforteroient.' Froissart, vol.
					iii. c. 127.</p>
				<p>In hoc statu propinqui ejus, Joannes Lindesius,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1385tm" /> Joannes et Valterus Sinclari, de eo cum rogassent
					ecquid valeret? 'Ego, inquit, recte valeo: morior enim non in lecto segni fato, sed quemadmodum omnes prope majores mei: illa vero a

				<p>This last is certainly more like a Roman hero, but is it not less like James Douglas? and after this I must tell you that I have just

					<p>I live not, alas! in the midst of libraries, consequently cannot get one of the books you are so kind to mention. I found the gap
						between Froissart and Comines, and longed for Monstrelet, which I found quoted so often by Rapin and Hainault,<anchor
							xml:id="id_tg3a.1390tm" /> whom I have read as far as the period I am arrived at in English history, and shall continue. His outline
						seems that of a master, and he has contrived to put more than one could expect in an abridgment.</p>
					<p>My mother desires me to make her compliments to you. We both congratulate Mr. Brown on his additional good fortune.<anchor

					years ago, at least 240£ more. it was in the gift of the Crown during the vacancy of the See of Ely, &amp; that its value is really

				<p>I am sincerely concern'd to find Miss Wharton is still an Invalide. I believe, you must send her into the milder regions of the

					Dec: at night it blew a dreadful storm. the first grain of snow was seen on Xmas Day, of wch we have had a good deal since, but never
					deep or lasting. the 2d week in Jan: was really severe cold at London, &amp; the Thames frozen over. one morning that week the glass
					stood here (at 8 in the morning) at 16 degrees, wch is the lowest I ever knew it at Cambridge. at London it never has been observed

					<salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>Your Friend <hi rend="italic">Jean Froissart,</hi> Son of Thomas by profession a Herald-painter, was born at Valenciennes in Haynault
					about the year 1337. was by nature fond of every <hi rend="italic">noble</hi> diversion, as hunting, hawking, dress, good-cheer, wine,
					&amp; women (this latter passion commenced at 12 years old) and was in his own time no less distinguish'd by his gallant poesies (still
					preserved in Mss) than by his historical writings, wch he begun at the desire of <hi rend="italic">Robert de Namur,</hi> Seigneur de
					Beaufort, when he was barely 20 years of age. at 24 he made his first voyage into England, &amp; presented the first part of his
					history to Edw: the 3d's Queen, Philippa of Haynault, who appointed him <hi rend="italic">Clerk of her chamber,</hi> that is,
					Secretary, by wch he became one of the Houshold in that Court. after the death of this Queen in 1369 he had the Living of <hi
						rend="italic">Lessines</hi> in his own country given him, &amp; must then consequently be a Priest. he attach'd himself to Wenceslaus
					of Luxemburg, Duke of Brabant, who dying in 1384, he became Clerk of the Chappel to Guy Comte de Blois, who probably gave him a canonry
					in the collegiate Church of <hi rend="italic">Chimay</hi> near Marienbourg in the county of Haynault.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1418tm" />
					he also had obtain'd of the Pope a reversion of another canonry in the Church of Lisle; but of this he never could get possession.
					after 27 years absence from England he made a third voyage thither in 1395, &amp; stay'd in it only 3 months. his Patron Guy de Blois
					died in 1397, &amp; Froissart survived him certainly 4 years, but how much more is uncertain. these &amp; many more particulars are
					taken from the account of his life &amp; writings collected by Mons: <hi rend="italic">de la Curne</hi> de St Palaye,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1419tm" /> in 10 Tome of the <hi rend="italic">Mem: de l'Acad: des Inscript:ns</hi> &amp;c: where you may see much
					more about him. the same Author defends him strongly against the suspicions, that have been entertain'd, of his partiality to the
					English Nation.</p>
				<p>A Man at arms was a complicated machine, consisting of about seven Men, i:e: the Knight or Gentleman himself compleatly &amp; heavily
					arm'd &amp; mounted on his great war-horse caparison'd &amp; arm'd as strongly as the Rider: the rest were his Esquires rather meant to
					assist him &amp; watch his motions in the combat, than to engage in action themselves. all of them were (as I apprehend) on horseback,
					&amp; thus taken together, made the principal strength &amp; principal expence of armies in those days. <hi rend="italic">Ecuyers</hi>
					were the sons of Gentleman,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1420tm" /> train'd up in quality of <hi rend="italic">Pages</hi> till 12 years old
					(commonly not in their Father's Castle, but in that of some famous Knight, his Friend) after wch age they assumed the title of <hi
						rend="italic">Esquires,</hi> were exercised daily in feats of arms &amp; curtesy, attended the person of their Lord at home &amp;
					abroad, and at 21 were qualified to receive themselves the order of knighthood. read the same St Palaye's <hi rend="italic">Mem: de
						l'ancienne Chevalerie,</hi> 2 v: 8vo. 1759, Paris. if you would have me say any thing to T:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1421tm" /> you must
					remind me, what period of time he enquired about, for my memory fails me.</p>
				<p>You may be sure of a month's notice from me, if I undertake the voyage,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1422tm" /> wch seems to me next to
					impossible. I received a letter from B:n last night, wch mentions you kindly, &amp; seems very desirous, we should come this summer.
					what you m[entio]n<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1423tm" /> of herrings<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1424tm" /> I know not: I have never seen or
					heard of them!</p>
				<p>Monstrelet<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1425tm" /> reaches from A:D: 1400 to 1467,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1426tm" /> &amp; there are
					additions at the end of him, that come down to 1516. it is a splendid &amp; very substantial Folio, publ:d in 1572.<anchor

				<p>The <hi rend="italic">Minstrel</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1430tm" /> came safe to my hands, and I return you my sincere thanks for so acceptable a present. In return, I
					shall give you my undisguised opinion of him, as he proceeds, without considering to whom he owes his birth, and sometimes without
					specifying my reasons; either because they would lead me too far, or because I may not always know what they are myself.</p>
				<p>I think we should wholly adopt the language of Spenser's time, or wholly renounce it.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1431tm" /> You say, you
					have done the latter; but, in effect, you retain <hi rend="italic">fared, forth, meed, wight, ween, gaude, shene, in sooth, aye,
						eschew,</hi> &amp;c.; obsolete words, at least in these parts of the island, and only known to those that read our ancient authors, or
					such as imitate them.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1432tm" />
				</p>
				<p>St. 2. v. 5. The <hi rend="italic">obstreperous</hi> trump of fame hurts my ear, though meant to express a jarring sound.</p>
				<p>St. 3. v. 6. <hi rend="italic">And from his bending,</hi> &amp;c., the grammar seems deficient: yet as the mind easily fills up the
					ellipsis, perhaps it is an atticism, and not inelegant.</p>
				<p>St. 4. and ult. <hi rend="italic">Pensions, posts, and praise.</hi> I cannot reconcile myself to this, nor to the whole following
					stanza; especially <hi rend="italic">the plaister of thy hair.</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1433tm" />
				</p>
				<p>
					<hi rend="italic">Surely the female heart,</hi> &amp;c., St. 6. The thought is not just. We cannot justify the sex from the conduct of
					the Muses, who are only females by the help of Greek mythology; and then, again, how should they bow the knee in the fane of a Hebrew
					or Philistine devil? Besides, I am the more severe, because it serves to introduce what I most admire.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1434tm"
					 />
				</p>
				<p>St. 7. <hi rend="italic">Rise, sons of harmony,</hi> &amp;c. This is charming; the thought and the expression. I will not be so
					hypercritical as to add, but it is <hi rend="italic">lyrical,</hi> and therefore belongs to a different species of poetry. Rules are
					but chains, good for little, except when one can break through them; and what is fine gives me so much pleasure, that I never regard
					what place it is in.</p>
				<p>St. 8, 9, 10. All this thought is well and freely handled, particularly, <hi rend="italic">Here peaceful are the vales,</hi> &amp;c.
						<hi rend="italic">Know thine own worth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Canst thou forego,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
				<p>St. 11. <hi rend="italic">O, how canst thou renounce,</hi> &amp;c. But this, of all others, is my favourite stanza. It is true
					poetry; it is inspiration; only (to show it is mortal) there is one blemish; the word <hi rend="italic">garniture</hi> suggesting an
					idea of dress, and, what is worse, of French dress.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1435tm" />
				</p>
				<p>St. 12. Very well. <hi rend="italic">Prompting th' ungenerous wish,</hi> &amp;c. But do not say <hi rend="italic">rambling muse;
						wandering,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">devious,</hi> if you please.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1436tm" /></p>
				<p> St. 13. <hi rend="italic">A nation fam'd,</hi> &amp;c. I like this compliment to your country; the simplicity, too, of the following
					narrative; only in st. 17 the words <hi rend="italic">artless</hi> and <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> are too synonymous to come so near
					each other.</p>
				<p>St. 18. <hi rend="italic">And yet poor Edwin,</hi> &amp;c. This is all excellent, and comes very near the level of st. 11 in my
					esteem; only, perhaps, <hi rend="italic">And some believed him mad,</hi> falls a little too flat, and rather below simplicity.</p>
				<p>St. 21. <hi rend="italic">Ah, no!</hi> By the way, this sort of interjection is rather too frequent with you, and will grow
					characteristic, if you do not avoid it.</p>
				<p>In that part of the poem which you sent me before, you have altered several little particulars much for the better.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1437tm" />
				</p>
				<p>St. 34. I believe I took notice before of this excess of alliteration. <hi rend="italic">Long, loaded, loud,</hi> lament, <hi
						rend="italic">lonely,</hi> lighted, <hi rend="italic">lingering, listening;</hi> though the verses are otherwise very good, it looks
					like affectation.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1438tm" />
				</p>
				<p>St. 36, 37, 38. Sure you go too far in lengthening a stroke of Edwin's character and disposition into a direct narrative, as of a
					fact. In the mean time, the poem stands still, and the reader grows impatient. Do you not, in general, indulge a little too much in <hi
						rend="italic">description</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reflection</hi>? This is not my remark only, I have heard it observed by others;
					and I take notice of it here, because <hi rend="italic">these</hi> are among the stanzas that might be spared; they are good,
					nevertheless, and might be laid by, and employed elsewhere to advantage.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1439tm" />
				</p>
				<p>St. 42. Spite of what I have just now said, this digression pleases me so well, that I cannot spare it. </p>
				<p>St. 46, v. ult. The <hi rend="italic">infuriate</hi> flood. I would not make new words without great necessity; it is very hazardous
					at best.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1440tm" /></p>
				<p> St. 49, 50, 51, 52. All this is very good; but <hi rend="italic">medium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">incongruous,</hi> being words of
					art, lose their dignity in my eyes, and savour too much of prose. I would have read the last line&#x2013; 'Presumptuous child of dust,
					be humble and be wise.' But, on second thoughts, perhaps&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">'For thou art but of dust'</hi>&#x2013;is better and
					more solemn, from its simplicity.</p>
				<p>St. 53. <hi rend="italic">Where dark,</hi> &amp;c. You return again to the charge. Had you not said enough before?<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1441tm" />
				</p>
				<p>St. 54. <hi rend="italic">Nor was this ancient dame,</hi> &amp;c. Consider, she has not been mentioned for these six stanzas
					backward.</p>
				<p>St. 56, v. 5. <hi rend="italic">The vernal day.</hi> With us it rarely thunders in the spring, but in the summer frequently.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1442tm" />
				</p>
				<p>St. 57, 58. Very pleasing, and has much the rhythm and expression of Milton in his youth. The last four lines strike me less by far. </p>
				<p>St. 59. The first five lines charming. Might not the mind of your conqueror be checked and softened in the mid-career of his
					successes by some domestic misfortune (introduced by way of episode, interesting and new, but not too long), that Edwin's music and its
					triumphs may be a little prepared, and more consistent with probability?<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1443tm" />
				</p>
				<p>I am happy to hear of your successes in another way, because I think you are serving the cause of human nature, and the true interest
					of mankind. Your book is read here too, and with just applause.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1444tm" /></p>

					<dateline>Blundeston, March 16, 1771. </dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>Yesterday I received a letter from De Bonstetten, crammed fuller than it could hold, and containing besides two little
					after-thoughts, one three inches by two, the other two by one, which flew out when I opened the letter like the oracles of the Sybil.
					But I like this much better than any I have received; he intreats us a deux genoux to come, and I you in the same posture and with
					equal earnestness; if he does not esteem me he is an idiot to take so much pains to persuade me to believe it, because, if he were
					false, I see no end that it could answer to make a dupe of me at the expense of so much labour and unnecessary dissimulation. He
					promises, if we come, that he will visit us in England the summer following. Let us go then, my dear Mr. Gray, and leave low thoughted
						care<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1446tm" /> at the foot of the mountains, for the air above is too pure for it. During the winter, my
					wandering inclinations are quiet in their hybernacula; but these two or three last glorious days succeeding the rigour of such an
					unusual season, have awakened them; the animal and vegetable world rejoice, and every thing that has life in it begins to shew it. I
					have lived in the air (being fortunately compelled to attend my garden myself) except during dinner, &amp;c. The effect of this and De
					Bonstetten's letter is, that I find something 'che mi sprona'<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1447tm" /> invincibly to go to Switzerland this
					summer. A deux genoux, I again intreat you to go with me. To-day, as I sat at breakfast in a room without sun, I felt myself in prison,
					and the world abroad appeared to me not a reality, but some golden vision raised by enchantment. The moment the windows were flung up,
					an earthly smell came in, exhaled by the sun from the loose and fermenting mould of the garden and fields. 'In those vernal seasons of
					the year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and sullenness against nature not to go out and see her riches, and
					partake in her rejoicing with heaven and earth.'<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1448tm" /> I am not so sullen; I do partake with her, and feel
					that this is a natural joy, which confesses its origin by being sincere and unmixed, and by leaving no bitterness on the palate behind
					it; but, on the contrary, opens, dilates, and warms the heart. I really find myself as inclined to pray, in such a day as this, as
					Petrarch was on the summit of the mountain.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1449tm" /> Pardon this rant, which, though I felt, I ought perhaps
					to have repressed. The burthen of the song is, 'Go to Switzerland with me, I beseech you.' In the mean time, for I have not a moment to
					lose, I shall venture to bespeak a curate from the first of June to the last of October, and consider of ways and means for a supply
					adequate to my great occasions: but I will go, though twenty St. Gothards were in the way. The geometra fasciaria, I think (ignorant,
					alas! that I was an enemy of the Linnæan faction) flew against me in the twilight yesterday evening; otherwise I have found but few
					insects yet. I have some larvæ in boxes, that I met with under the roots of plants. The mosses require too painful an attention without
					an instructor, so I shall wait for one. I have looked at a few common birds, and this is all. The rest of my time has been taken up
					with Froissart, Guicciardini, &amp;c. I am still reading the latter, and extracting from the former. A thousand thanks for your letter,
					full of information, but giving me a curiosity to see books that I cannot get here. Pray what were the heralds, who seem to have been
					so liberally rewarded, and called in with the minstrels at great entertainments, as well as employed in carrying defiances, &amp;c.
					What is the difference between bannière and pennon?<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1450tm" /> each principal commander (but these are vague
					words) seems to have marched with a bannière peculiar to him, on which his arms were painted, and a pennon seems inferior. I have put
					the story of the Irish Kings,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1451tm" /> from Froissart, into English; and am now gathering many scattered
					curiosities relating to the manners of the Scotch in that age. I am besides reading at odd times Hall's Chronicle,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1452tm" /> and my mother and I have just begun the second volume of Robertson's Charles the Fifth, because we know

					finished Don Quixote. Temple desires a plan for modern history,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1454tm" /> not confined to any particular

					and a few friends who wish him well, without being able to do more) and received with great joy and gratitude. I believe my house will
					be continued to me on the present footing.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1455tm" /> De Bonstetten in one of the flying scraps says, 'M.

					understand what le prendre en pension means. Is it that he would board with some one who would instruct him in English and other
					matters? Perhaps M. Freundenrich is a person that he has mentioned to you, and thinks I know him of course. Do you know a book that De
					Bonstetten recommends to me, Danielis Eremitæ Vita,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1457tm" /> &amp;c. with a voyage to Switzerland at the end?
					Pray let me hear soon. My mother's compliments. The post is forbid to send letters cross.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1458tm" />

					<salute>Dear Sir, </salute>
				</opener>
				<p>It is six weeks since I received De Bonstetten's letter, in consequence of which I wrote to you;<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1514tm" /> I
					have long waited for your determination, to enable me to answer it; my own was already made when I wrote to you, only I cannot fix a
					time till I know yours. I need not say whether it would be agreeable to me to have your company in such a voyage; without it, I shall
					lose half the pleasure and advantage I flattered myself with the hope of, but I shall go at all events. I should think the first or
					second week in June, at furthest, is quite late enough to begin the journey; if so, it is high time, I think, to give notice to De
					Bonstetten. I have provided both money and a curate, the former, the sum I mentioned to you, two hundred pounds, and the latter, from
					the beginning of June, to the end of October, or a few Sundays longer, if I want him. I wrote to Wheeler<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1515tm"
					 /> (not about Berne) many months ago, but by a very uncertain direction, I have not heard a word since and know nothing about him, nor
					where to direct, so he is quite out of the question, and if you don't go with me, I shall go alone.</p>
				<p>As for Temple's matter,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1516tm" /> I see it is troublesome to you, and am very sorry I ever mentioned it; I
					did not understand, nor did he mean, I think, that you was to have the trouble of forming a complete list of authors, but only of
					pointing out a few of the best and most necessary in each period sufficient to make the links of the chain, and continue it down
					unbroken and uninterrupted. Your sympathy with his distress drew this trouble on you and encouraged my zeal to become impertinent.</p>
				<p>I congratulate the ministry and the University on the honour they have both acquired by the promotion of Mr. Scott;<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1517tm" /> may there never be wanting such lights of the church! and such ornaments of that famous seminary of virtue
					and good learning. </p>
				<p>I have found many insects, chiefly carabi and staphyli, great variety of the latter; this unseasonable season has put the months
					quite out of order, all of the vegetable tribe that should have looked gay and flourished early in March, just begin to peep up half
					starved with cold, and wishing themselves back again.</p>

					(wch I surely wish) I should be able to accompany you, perhaps I may prevail upon you to stay a week or fortnight for me: if I find it
					will not do, you certainly shall know it.</p>
				<p>Three days ago I had so strange a letter from B: I hardly know how to give you any account of it, &amp; desire you would not speak of
					it to any body. that he has been <hi rend="italic">le plus malheureux des hommes,</hi> that he is <hi rend="italic">decidé à quitter

						rend="italic">un pistolet &amp; du courage,</hi>
					<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1520tm" /> &amp; all without the shadow of a reason assign'd, &amp; so he leaves me. he is either disorder'd in
					his intellect (wch is too possible) or has done some strange thing, that has exasperated his whole family &amp; friends at home, wch
					(I'm afraid) is at least equally possible. I am quite at a loss about it. you will see &amp; know more: but by all means curb these
					vagaries &amp; wandering imaginations, if there be any room for counsels. </p>
				<p>You aggravate my misfortunes by twitting me with Temple,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1521tm" /> as if a pack of names of books &amp;
					editions were any cure for his uneasiness, &amp; that I witheld it from him. I have had neither health nor spirits<anchor

					were seen 23 April, the Redstart, on ye 26th, the Nightingale was heard on ye 29th, &amp; the Cuckow, on 1st of May. methinks I could

				<p>I have just received the enclosed from my poor unfortunate Temple; it is a matter too nice for me to meddle with without your advice;
					you directed my interposition between the same persons before,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1524tm" /> and with good success; pity I am sure
					will plead more strongly with you now, because the case is more important. I cannot bear to see such a sacrifice to filial piety in the
					person of one whom I esteem for that and a thousand valuable qualities, and whom his misfortunes have made me love; his mind and
					constitution too are too feeble for such struggles. I cannot bear to see him absolutely ruined, he is now nearer than ever, and cannot
					be saved but by the help of Lord Lisburne, or some one else who is able to help him; if I could be the means of awakening Lord
					Lisburne's humanity, it would be the action of my life I should reflect on with most pleasure. But it is too delicate a matter for me
					to undertake unassisted, when I may hope to have the benefit of your wise and friendly counsels; let me entreat you to send them
					speedily, he is waiting in an anxious suspense, which, if it last long, may too easily change to despair; I own I dread some desperate
					event; the silence with which he reproaches me was only occasioned by my waiting daily for an answer from you; this is a matter of so
					much greater consequence, and any little delay, any suspicion of neglect in me may work such fatal effects in a mind subdued by
					distress and on the brink already of despair, that I hope you will answer this directly, for I shall not write to him till I receive
					your answer. </p>
				<p>I have writ to De Bonstetten to say I shall certainly be at Berne this summer, and that I am not without hopes of having your company
					thither; that, if I arrive not by the end of June, and he hear not again, he may conclude that I have waited for you, and that you come
					too. I have received a very civil invitation from Dr. Hallifax<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1525tm" /> to pass some time at Trinity Hall; if
					(as I suspect) it is a civility which I owe entirely to you, I am very much obliged to you for it, but it will not be in my power to
					comply with the invitation, because I must go to town the other road and pass a week with my uncle<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1526tm" /> in

				<p>I received your letter inclosing that of poor T:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1529tm" /> the night before I set out for London. I would by
					all means wish you to comply with his request. you may say many things to Ld L:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1529tm1" /> with a better grace,
					than he can. I trust to the cause, &amp; to the warmth of your own kindness, for inspiration: there is little of management required,
					nothing to conceal, but the full persuasion (I trust) we both have, that Ld L: knows the distress of his circumstances at least as well
					as we do. this doubtless must be kept out of sight, lest it carry too keen a reproach with it. in all the rest you are at full liberty
					to expatiate on his good qualities, the friendship you have long had for him, the pious imprudence, that has produced his present
					uneasy situation, &amp; above all your profound respect for Lord L:s character &amp; sensibility of heart.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1530tm" />
				</p>
				<p>who knows what may be the consequence? Men sometimes catch that feeling from a Stranger, wch should have originally sprung from their
					own heart. as to the means of helping him, his own schemes are perhaps too wild for you to mention them to Ld L: &amp; (if they are to
					separate him from his Wife &amp; family) what is to come of them in the mean time? I have a notion that the Chaplainship at Leghorn is
					still vacant by the death of a young Mr Byrom. at least I have never heard it was fill'd up. it depends on recommendation to the
					principal Italian Merchants, wch seems much in Ld L:s power. The Bp of Derry<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1531tm" /> (I apprehend) is at
					Nice, or somewhere in Italy, for his health: it is true he has a great patronage in Ireland, &amp; sometimes (from vanity) may do a
					right thing. the other projects do not strike me as any thing, but (if Ld L: can be brought to mean him well) many different means will
					occur, by wch he may serve him.</p>
				<p>I shall pass a fortnight here, &amp; perhaps within that time may see you in Town, at least I would wish so to do.<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1532tm" /> I am but indifferently well, &amp; think, all things consider'd, it is best not to keep you in suspense
					about my journey.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1533tm" /> the sense of my own duty,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1534tm" /> which I do not perform,
					my own low spirits (to which this consideration not a little contributes) &amp; (added to these) a bodily indisposition make it
					necessary for me to deny myself that pleasure, which perhaps I have kept too long in view. I shall see however with your eyes, &amp;
					accompany you at least in idea. write or come, or both soon.</p>

					<salute>Dear Doctor </salute>

				<p>I was really far from well in health, when I received your last letter: since that I am come to Town, &amp; find myself considerably
					better. Mason has pass'd all the winter here with Stonhewer in Curson-Street, May-fair, but thinks of returning homeward in a week or
					ten days. he had your letter (wch had gone round by Aston) &amp; was applying to Mr Fraser<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1538tm" /> &amp;
					others for proper recommendations in case poor Mrs. E:<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1539tm" /> should be obliged to make use of them: but now
					you have given us some hopes, that these expedients may not be necessary. I for my own part do heartily wish, you may not be deceived,
					&amp; that so cool a Tyrant as her Husband seems to be, may willingly give up the thoughts of exercising that tyranny, when it is most
					in his power: but, I own, it seems to me very unlikely. however I would not have you instrumental (but at her most earnest intreaty) in
					sending her out of his reach. no persuasion or advice on this head should come from you: it should be absolutely her own firm
					resolution (before sure witnesses) for that is the only thing, that can authorise you to assist her. it must have been her own fault
					(at least her weakness) that such a decision as that of these Delegates<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1540tm" /> could find any grounds to go
					upon. I do not wonder, that such an event has discomposed you: it discomposes me to think of the trouble &amp; expence it has brought
					on you!</p>
				<p>My summer was intended to have been pass'd in Switzerland: but I have drop'd the thought of it, &amp; believe my expeditions will
					terminate in Old-park: for travel I must, or cease to exist. till this year I hardly knew what (mechanical) low-spirits were: but now I
					even tremble at an east-wind. it is here the height of summer, but with all the bloom &amp; tender verdure of spring. at Cambridge the
					Laurustines &amp; Arbutus kill'd totally: Apricots, Almonds, &amp; Figs lost all their young shoots. St:r<anchor

				<p>I am much mortified that you give me so little hopes of your company on my journey, but I do not quite despair of that point. I am

				<p>The inclosed came a few days after you left us,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1557tm" /> as I apprehend, from Temple. I continue here much
					against my will. the gout is gone, the feverish disorder abated, but not cured; my spirits much oppress'd, &amp; the more so, as I
					foresee a new complaint, that may tie me down perhaps to my bed, &amp; expose me to the operations of a Surgeon. God knows, what will
					be the end of it.</p>
				<p>It will be an alleviation to my miseries, if I can hear, you are well, &amp; capable of enjoying those objects of curiosity, that the
					countries you are in<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1558tm" /> promise to afford you. the greater the detail you give me of them, the happier I

					but that Mr. T: Pitt<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1560tm" /> is going to be married to a Miss Wilkinson, the daughter of a rich Merchant, who
					gives her 30,000£ down, &amp; at least as much more in expectation.</p>

					<dateline>Paris, June 29,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1564tm" /> 1771.</dateline>
				</opener>
				<p>Here have I been since Wednesday last! not a word yet from you! are you worse? I hope not, better? why will you not let me know? It
					was Friday last<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1565tm" /> that I set out; that night I lay at Sittingbourne, the next day reached Dover by
					dinner time; after dinner I walked shivering with the East wind to Shakespeare's cliff, which is certainly dreadful enough to be
					improved by an imagination like his to what he has made it. I trembled, thought of you, collected a few plants, and returned to examine
					them. Sunday morning at six we embarked, and arrived at Calais at nine; from thence after haggling for a chaise, waiting for horses,
					&amp;c. I set out in the afternoon in company with two Englishmen with whom I passed the sea. The total change of things in passing
					twenty miles struck me with astonishment the moment I set my foot on shore at Calais; we lay that night at Boulogne; the country as you
					know is not very agreeable, exactly like Cambridgeshire, uninclosed corn fields with a few hills with a tree or two on them. Towards
					Montreuil it mends, some pleasant valleys for this country wind among the corn land, several woods appear, and Montreuil itself, seated
					on a rising ground, is a good object. In going post there is not much time for observation. </p>
				<p>The West front of the church of Abbeville struck me however as of the best and most beautiful gothic. At Amiens we arrived about
					three o'clock on Monday morning, at six we rose again and went to the cathedral, which was then full of people; a thousand different
					sorts of devotion going forward at the same time at different altars and in different chapels, little bells of different tones
					perpetually tingling for the elevation of the host, in short, the Boulevards since have put me very much in mind of it. The church is
					very handsome in itself, and adorned with a magnificence that pretends at least a zeal for religion, if it does not imply it. But all
					this was done in such haste and so much between sleeping and waking, that I reckon myself to have seen nothing in my journey. Tuesday
					we slept at Chantilly; there is a stateliness in the Castle and its apartments, and their furniture very new to an Englishman. It was
					the finest evening possible, which added not a little to the spectacle; the castle seemed to come forward in relief from the purple and
					gold of a most glorious setting sun, which glowed in the water as well as in the sky; to this succeeded clear moonlight without a drop
					of dew. From Chantilly we reached Paris by noon next day, Wednesday &#x2013;just giving a peep at St. Denis, but not at the treasury,
					for it was a wrong hour. Every thing that I have seen hitherto has been with the disadvantage of companions who see because they think
					they ought to see. In this manner I have run over le Palais Royal, but not in this manner the Cloister of the Chartreux,<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1566tm" /> where I passed part of this morning in admiration! The greatness of conception, the pure simple style so
					suited to the subject, the penetrating expression, the dignity of attitude, and if I may be allowed to talk of colouring, composition,
					grouping, and keeping, the perfection of those too<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1567tm" /> make all that I have seen before trifling and
					little: there is besides an interesting solemnity on the subject if one forgets, as I did, entirely that it is only a silly legend; by
					that simple dignity peculiar to himself he has contrived to make every part of the story interesting, even such as St. Hugo conferring
					the white habit, the Pope confirming the institution, &amp;c. the death of St. Bruno, the interpretation of the dream, the resurrection
					of Raymond Diocre, and the figure of St. Bruno in the first piece, when he hears with deep attention and with a candour in his
					countenance open to conviction, the Doctor Raymond Diocre strike me most, at least I think so, but I wont swear till I have been again
					and again. In their chapter house too there is a fine picture by Le Sueur of the appearance of our Saviour to Mary Magdalen. Very much
					of the painting in the cloister is in perfect preservation, parts very much hurt, as it seems, by the dripping of water, there are
					doors to shut them in, but the mischief when it happens comes from the wall to which they are fastened. I saw the good fathers (for
					really they look so) at their devotions, deep devotion! accompanied with prostrations that had not the appearance of acts only of form
					or custom. I rather envied them for a moment, and felt myself 'une ame mondaine.'<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1568tm" />
				</p>
				<p>To-morrow (Sunday) I go to Versailles, and shall not return till Monday; Tuesday or Wednesday I set off; you will still direct if you
					please to me chez Messrs. Telluson and Neckar, à Paris. </p>
				<p>The people here dare to express their discontentment very loudly; it is the Chancellor<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1569tm" /> who is the
					chief object of their hatred; there is a competition for power between him and the D. D'Aiguillon,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1570tm" />
					the latter, it is thought, would be glad to put the most odious acts on him, and to see him ruined afterwards. Les pauvres princes, as
					the people call them, seem to be able to do little. All matters of property have been at a stand some time, criminal justice proceeds
					as usual. All complain, but seem to despair of a remedy. A fowl sells here for six or seven shillings.</p>

				<p>I am glad to hear from Molly<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1942tm" /> today, that there is no particular charge against you in your office,
					for if it is only the greediness of the Corporation,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1943tm" /> I will think it will be easily disappointed, the
					assurance Mr Shelvocke<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1944tm" /> has given you, that you are secure weighs much with me: so much, that I doubt
					it was hardly necessary to speak to Ld Besborough<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1945tm" /> on that head, for to petition before one is accused
					of any thing, may appear as if we were conscious of having done somewhat amiss: however my Letter is gone, &amp; can not be recalled,
					if it is unne[cessary]<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1946tm" /> so much the better.</p>
				<p>I believe &amp; hope, you may continue ve[ry sure] on this head. let it only caution you to see the bus[iness] of your office
					diligently executed, &amp; to avoid even the least occasion of complaint, and then you have little to fear. </p>

				<p>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; I received M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Talbot's<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1950tm" /> letter from Bath, &amp; hear today, that he is return'd to
				Cambridge. I should write to him, had I anything worth his notice, that I could tell him in a letter. I hope, he continues to feel the
				good effects of his journey.<lb /> &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; You probably know as well as I do, that the M: of Rockingham<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1951tm" /> has given a
				considerable living, Keeton (I think, is its name)<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1952tm" /> in Huntingd:<hi rend="super">n[s?]</hi> worth near 300&#xa3; a-year, tenable with his
				Mastership, to the V: Chancellour.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1953tm" />  it is just under the nose of Hinchinbroke &amp; Kimbolton, &amp; comes very a-propos in all respects.
				I desire to know the policy of Trinity-Hall. there are 10 fellows (not insane) that elect, and I hear 5, if not 6, of them are
				Candidates for the Mastership, among w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> Mat. Robinson<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1954tm"
					 /> is one. D<hi rend="super">r</hi> Calvert<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1955tm" /> (I hear) has got
				the Chancellorship of Worcester.</p>
				<p> &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; I am sorry to tell you, that the tragical story of the Prisoners in India,<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1956tm" />  with those sad circumstances
				you saw in the Papers comes from M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Pigot<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1957tm" /> lately return'd from thence. it is true, he had his intelligence from a
				Black Native of the Country concerning their fate: but it is generally believed here. Clive<anchor
						xml:id="id_tg3a.1958tm" /> embarks on Tuesday.<lb /> &#xa0; &#xa0;
				&#xa0; &#xa0; You will oblige me in sending Sally's account<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1959tm" /> (I mean the sum total) as soon as you are able, for I know not how soon I
				shall leave London. Nicholls tells me, you are well, &amp; walk to Ditton.<anchor xml:id="id_tg3a.1960tm" /></p>

			<p> Get some coarse brown Bay Salt: this is the sine qu&#xE2; non, &amp; (by the way) is not to be had at Cambridge, where under the name
				of Bay Salt they sell a whitish Kind of Salt, that will never do for our Purpose, &amp; will spoil all: at London the true Sort is
				common in every Shop, &amp; a Pennyworth of it is enough to make a Bushel of Perfumes. Take a Peck of Damask Roses, pick'd from the
				Cups, Orange Flowers all you can get, Cloves (the Spice) a Quarter of an Ounce, cut small: scatter them in your Jar mixt in Layers about
				2 Inches thick, &amp; thinly sprinkle the Salt over them: repeat this, 'till the Vessel is three Quarters, or more, full: cover it close
				down, let it stand 2 Days, &amp; then stir it up well with a wooden Ladle or Skimmer: repeat this often, &amp; it is made. If it is
				always moist to the Touch, it is right: if over-wet, you have only to put in more Flowers, &amp; no more Salt. You may use, if you
				please, Tops of Lavender, Myrtle-Leaves bruised, Rose-Geranium, Angelica, Shavings of Orrice-Root, or (where Orange Flowers are scarce)
				young green Oranges sliced, or even the yellow Rind of Seville-Oranges: but of these Things a very little will do, least they overpower
				the Rest. I can not be particular as to Quantities, because I observed none myself.</p>

						&#xa0; &#xa0; My Dear S<hi rend="super">r</hi>

				<p> &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; From the Time I saw your Letter, I had little Reason to entertain any Hopes of poor M<hi rend="super"
						>r</hi> Whithed's Life, yet have not been at all less struck with the News of his Death. His youth, his fortune, &amp; his
					Expectations, must make it a Subject of Compassion, even to Strangers: his Temper, his many good Qualities, &amp; that Kindness I have
					constantly received from him, will make his Loss particularly sensible to me, who have (God knows) so few Friends to throw away, but I
					own, what most nearly interests me in it, is the Concern of M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Chute, whose Surprize must have been equal to his
					Sorrow, &amp; who perhaps had not Time or Resolution to see a Face he had been so long accustom'd to, till it was hid from him for
					ever. I can not think of troubling him with so useless a Thing as a Letter at such a Time, but must beg of you, if you either see, or
					have occasion to write to him, just to say, how much I feel for him &amp; how eagerly I wish him that Happiness, &amp; Ease of Mind,
						w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> Time only can give him: for his own Reflexion &amp; Good Sense will, I am afraid, but add to his
					Sensibility. You will much oblige me, when you can give me any Account of him, or of any Thing that concerns him, for you see I have no
					body else to apply to; &amp; tho' the Loss you have had in your own Family (w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> I am heartily sorry for) makes
					this an unreasonable Request, yet (I trust) you will find a quarter of an hour to satisfy my Inquietude.</p>
