					       <salute>Dear Nicholls </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>Write by all means forthwith to Ld L:, give a little into his way of thinking, seem to fear you have
					gone a little too far in communicating so much of T:s letter, wch was not intended for his eye; but say you thought, you saw at bottom
					so much of respect &amp; affection for him, that you had the less scruple to lay open the weaknesses &amp; little suspicions of a
					Friend, that (you know beyond a doubt) very gratefully &amp; sincerely loves him. remind him 
					
					<hi rend="italic">eloquently</hi> (that is, from your heart, &amp; in such expressions as that will furnish) how many idle suspicions a sensible mind, naturally disposed to melancholy, &amp; depress'd by misfortune,
					is capable of entertaining, especially if it meets with but a shadow of neglect or contempt from the very (perhaps the only) person, in
					whose kindness it had taken refuge. remind him of his former goodness frankly &amp; generously shewn to T:, &amp; beg him not to
					destroy the natural effects of it by any appearance of pique or resentment, for that even the fancies &amp; chim√¶ras of a worthy heart
					deserve a little management &amp; even respect. assure him, as I believe, you safely may, that a few kind words, the slightest
					testimony of his esteem will brush away all T:s suspicions &amp; gloomy thoughts &amp; that there will need after this no constraint on
					his own behaviour (no, not so much as to ring a bell) for, when one is secure of people's intentions,
					all the rest passes for nothing.</p>
				     <p>To this purpose (but in my own way) would I write, &amp; mighty respectfully withall. it will come well from you, &amp; you can say
					without consequence what in T: himself it would be mean to say. Ld L: is rather more piqued than needs, methinks. the truth is, the
					causes of this quarrel on paper do appear puerile, as to the matter; but the manner is all, &amp; that we do not see. I rather stick by
					my Ld still, &amp; am set against Madam Minx: yet (as I told you before) the <hi rend="italic">house</hi> lies hard at my stomach.
				</p>
				     <p>There are many letters &amp; things, that I never saw, as that strange one in Wales, &amp; that to
					Lady Lisb:, now without these how can I judge? you have seen more of the matter, &amp; perhaps may be right: but as yet I do not
					believe it. what can that <hi rend="italic">firm &amp; spirited</hi> letter be? I fear it will make
					matters worse, &amp; yet it was sent away before he had seen T:s letter to you. if he had, it would have made it worse still.</p>
				     <p>You ask, if you should copy Ld L:s, and send it to T:. I think, rather not. he has now had one from him himself. if you are obliged
					to do so, it should be only the sense of it, &amp; that abated &amp; mollified, especially all that tastes of contempt. </p>
				     <p>Adieu! bless your stars, that you are snug in fat-goose living, without a Minx, &amp; without a Lord.</p>
