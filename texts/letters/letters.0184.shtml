         <div class="salute">My dear Wharton</div>
      </div>
      <p>A little kind of Reproach, that I saw the other Day in a Letter of yours to Mr Brown,
         has made my Guilt fly in my Face, &amp; given me Spirit to be a Beast no longer. I desired
         him to tell you in the beginning of the Summer, that I fear'd my Journey into the
         North would be prevented by the Arrival of my Cousin, Mrs Forster<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (whom you remember by the Name of Pattinson) from India. she came in August; &amp; I
         continued in Town with her a Month in order to do what little Services I could to
         a Person as strange, &amp; as much to seek, as tho' she had been born in the Mud of the
         Ganges. after this the Year was too far advanced to undertake such an Expedition;
         &amp; the Thought of seeing you here in the Spring<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in some measure comforts me for the Disappointment; for I depend upon your coming
         then, when it will be far easier to confer together, &amp; determine about a Thing, in
         wch (I fear) I am too much interes[ted to deserve having]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> any great share in the Determination:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for [ ]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>People. you are aware undoubtedly, that a certain Deference, not to say Servility,
         to the Heads of Colleges is perhaps necessary to a Physician, that means to establish
         himself here: you possibly may find a Method to do without it. another Inconvenience
         your Wife, rather than you, will feel, the Want of Company of her own Sex; as the
         Women are few here, squeezy &amp; formal, and little skill'd in amusing themselves or
         other People. all I can say is, she must try to make up for it among the Men, who
         are not over-agreeable neither. I much approve of your settling seriously to your
         Profession; but as your Father is old, if you should lose him, what becomes of your
         Interest, &amp; to whom is it then to be transfer'd? would you leave London &amp; your Practise
         again to canvas an Election for yourself?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it seems to me, that, if you execute your present Scheme, you must (in case of Mr
         Wh:n's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Death) entirely lay aside all Views of that Kind. the gradual Transition you propose
         to make thro' Bath or Cambridge to London is very well judged, &amp; likely enough to
         succeed. for Bath, I am wholly unacquainted with it, &amp; consequently can say little
         to the Purpose. the Way of Life there might be more amusing to Mrs Wharton, than this;
         but to You, I think, would be less satisfactory. I sincerely congratulate you on the
         good Effects of your new Medecine, wch is indeed a sufficient Recompence for any Pains
         you have taken in that Study. but to make a just Tryal of its Efficacy &amp; of your own
         Constitution, you certainly ought to pass a little Time at London (a Month or so)
         &amp; that [ ]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> engaged himself to make it up 1000Â£, in case the Brothers will not do it, &amp; they
         have (after some Hesitation) refused it.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> our good Mr Brown goes out of his Office<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> today, of wch he is not a little glad. his College, wch had much declined for some
         time, is picking up again: they have had twelve Admissions this Year; &amp; are just filling
         up two Fellowships with a Mr Cardell,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whom I do not know, but they say, he is a good Scholar; &amp; a Mr Delaval,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a Fellow-Commoner (a younger Son to old Delaval<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Northumberland) who has taken his Degree in an exemplary Manner, &amp; is very sensible,
         &amp; knowing. the Appeal,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch has been so long contended for, will, I believe, at last be yielded to with a
         good Grace, or rather bestowed, by the Advice of the D: of N:, &amp; my Lord Ch:r,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; will be the best &amp; most popular Thing they can do, but you must not mention it,
         till it is actually done. I am sorry your friend Chapman will lose all the Merit of
         his Pamphlet,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch (by the Way) has been answer'd exceedingly well, &amp; with all due Contempt.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he seems much mortified, &amp; was preparing a Reply; but this Event, I doubt, will cut
         him short.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I know of nothing new in the literary Way, but the History of Lewis, 14th, by Voltaire;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> not that I have yet seen it but my Expectations are much raised.</p>
