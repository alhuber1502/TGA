         <div class="salute">Dear Sr</div>
      </div>
      <p>We perform'd our journey, a very agreeable one, within the time appointed, &amp; left
         out scarce any thing worth seeing in or near our way. the Doctor &amp; Mrs Wharton had
         expected us about two hours when we arrived at Studley on Friday; we passed that night
         at Rippon, &amp; the next at Richmond, and on Sunday Evening got to Durham. I can not
         now enter into the particulars of my travels, because I have not yet gather'd up my
         Quotations from the Classicks to intersperse, like Mr Addison: but I hope to be able
         soon to entertain you with a dish of very choice erudition. I have another reason
         too, wch is, that the Post is just setting out. suffice it to tell you, that I have
         one of the most beautiful Vales here in England to walk in with prospects that change
         every ten steps, &amp; open something new wherever I turn me, all rude &amp; romantic, in
         short the sweetest Spot to break your neck or drown yourself in that ever was beheld.
         I have done neither yet, but I have been twice at the Races, once at the Assembly,
         have had a visit from Dr Chapman &amp; dined with the Bishop. I am very shabby, for Stonhewer's
         Box with my Coat in it, wch went by Sea is not yet arrived. you are desired therefore
         to send Lee the Bedmaker at Pet: house to the Master of the Lynn-boats to enquire,
         what Vessel it was sent by, &amp; why it does not come. it was directed to Dr Stonhewer
         of Houghton to be left with the Rector of Sunderland. another trouble I have to give
         you, wch is to order Barnes to bring any Letters Stonhewer or I may have to you, &amp;
         direct 'em hither. the Doctor &amp; Mrs Wh: desire their particular Compliments to you,
         &amp; are sorry you could not be with us.
      </p>
