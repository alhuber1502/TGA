         <div class="salute">Dear Sr</div>
      </div>
      <p>We<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> perform'd our journey, a very agreeable one, within the time appointed,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; left out scarce any thing worth seeing in or near our way. the Doctor &amp; Mrs Wharton
         had expected us about two hours when we arrived at Studley<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on Friday; we passed that night at Rippon, &amp; the next at Richmond, and on Sunday
         Evening<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> got to Durham. I can not now enter into the particulars of my travels, because I
         have not yet gather'd up my Quotations from the Classicks to intersperse, like Mr
         Addison:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but I hope to be able soon to entertain you with a dish of very choice erudition.
         I have another reason too, wch is, that the Post is just setting out. suffice it to
         tell you, that I have one of the most beautiful Vales here in England to walk in with
         prospects that change every ten steps, &amp; open something new wherever I turn me, all
         rude &amp; romantic, in short the sweetest Spot to break your neck or drown yourself in
         that ever was beheld. I have done neither yet, but I have been twice at the Races,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> once at the Assembly, have had a visit from Dr Chapman<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; dined with the Bishop.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I am very shabby, for Stonhewer's Box with my Coat in it, wch went by Sea<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is not yet arrived. you are desired therefore to send Lee the Bedmaker at Pet: house
         to the Master of the Lynn-boats<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to enquire, what Vessel it was sent by, &amp; why it does not come. it was directed to
         Dr Stonhewer of Houghton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to be left with the Rector of Sunderland. another trouble I have to give you, wch
         is to order Barnes to bring any Letters Stonhewer or I may have to you, &amp; direct 'em
         hither. the Doctor &amp; Mrs Wh: desire their particular Compliments to you, &amp; are sorry
         you could not be with us.
