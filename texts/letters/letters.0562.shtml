         </div>
         <p>I received last night your letter big with another a week older than itself. you might
            as well have wrote to me from the deserts of Arabia, &amp; desired me to step over &amp; drink
            a dish of tea with you.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> this morning I sent to Aukland<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for a chaise: the Man's answer is, that he had a chaise with four horses return'd
            yesterday from Hartlepool, that the road was next to impassable, &amp; so dangerous, that
            he does not think of sending out any other that way, unless the season should change
            to a long drought. I would have gone by Durham, but am assured, that road is rather
            worse. what can I do? you speak so jauntily, &amp; enter so little into any detail of
            your own journey, that I conclude you came on horseback from Stockton (wch road however
            is little better for carriages) if so, we hope you will ride over to Old-Park with
            Mr Alderston:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there is room for you both, &amp; hearty welcome. the Doctor even talks of coming (for
            he can ride) to invite you on Monday. I wonder how you are accommodated, where you
            are; &amp; what you are doing with Gen: Carey: I would give my ears to get thither, but
            all depends on the sun.</p>

         <p>It is twenty miles to Old-Park, &amp; the way is by <span style="font-style:italic">Hart,</span> over Sherraton-moor &amp; through Trimden there is no village else that has a name. pray,
            write a line by the bearer. we have a confirmation of the above accou[n]t of the state
            of the roads from other evidences–nevertheless I shall certainly come on horseback
            on Monday to inquire after your proceedings and designs and to preveil upon You and
            Mr Aldeston to return with me to Old Park–a rainy morning perhaps may stop me a few
            hours but when it clears up I shall set forward. Adieu–accept all our Complimts.</p>
