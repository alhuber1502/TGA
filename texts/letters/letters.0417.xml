            <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>As to my pardon, for which you supplicate, you know too well how easily it is obtain'd without any reason at all: but now I have a
					very good one, as I have read the third Book of <hi rend="italic">the Ghost,</hi>
					 where Churchill has so mumbled Mr Whitehead, to whom you owe all
					your principles (see the unpublish'd elegy <hi rend="italic">de Amiciti√¢</hi>) that it would be base
					in me to demand any farther satisfaction. this only I shall add, that I would rather steal the Laureate's verses, than his
					sentiments.</p>
         <p>I am sorry for the disagreeable event you mention, wch I learnt by mere accident from Mr
						Curtall in a Coffee-House: I do not doubt, it must have taken up a good deal of your thoughts &amp;
					time, &amp; should wish to know, whether there are any hopes of the poor Fellow's recovery.</p>
         <p>We have received your poetical packet, &amp; deliver'd them to the several parties. the sentiments
					we do not remark, as we can find nothing within ourselves congenial to them. for the expression, we hint (but in a low &amp; timid
					voice) that there is a want of <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi>: in short they are nothing like the
					Choruses in Elfrida. only the lines that relate to Lady Cov:s beauty have made a deep impression upon
					us: we get them by heart, &amp; apply them to our Sempstresses &amp; Bedmakers. this is (I think) the sum &amp; substance of our
					reflections here. only Mrs Rutherforth observes, that there is great delicacy &amp; tenderness in the
					manner of treating so frail a character as that of L:y Cov:, &amp; that you have found a way to reconcile contempt &amp; compassion.
					these might not be her words, but this was the sense of them; &amp; I don't believe, she had it from the Doctor.</p>
         <p>I rejoice (in a weakly way, you may be sure, as I have not seen him some years, &amp; am in so different a way of life) but I rejoice
					to hear of any accession to Mr Hurd's fortune, as I do not believe he will be any thing the worse for
					it. Forester (whom I perceive you can still remember) is removed from Easton to a better living by his Patron Ld Maynard on purpose to get rid of him,
					for Easton is his own parish, &amp; he was sick to death of his company. he is now seated just by his Brother Pulter, &amp; they are mortal foes.</p>
         <p>Mr Brockett has got old Turner's Professorship, &amp; Delaval has lost it. when we meet I have
					something to tell you on this subject. I hope to continue here till March: if not, I shall inform you. how does the Peace agree with you?</p>
