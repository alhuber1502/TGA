            <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>You are so hospitable in your offers, that my Cargo is preparing to set out on Monday next, &amp;
					will (I imagine) present itself at your door on Tuesday or Wednesday next: it comes by water, &amp;
					the Man undertakes the whole together, so that I need not trouble any one to send to the wharf about them. I have divided this
						incumbrance between yourself &amp; Mrs Forster, yet am afraid you
					will find your share of it more than enough. it consists of <list>
               <item>1. A Chest cover'd with leather &amp; bound with iron. No 1. full of Bed &amp; Table Linnen.Â Â </item>
               <item>2. A large wainscot Box with iron handles, No 2. full of the same, &amp; other furniture.Â Â </item>
               <item>3. A long deal Box, No 3. of the same.Â Â </item>
               <item>4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Five large Baskets, of China. No 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.Â Â </item>
               <item>9. A wainscot Chest of Drawers, matted up. No 10. with table-linnen, covers for chairs, curtains, and some little
							Plate.Â Â </item>
               <item>10. A middling deal-box, of sheets, quilts, &amp;c: No 13.Â Â </item>
               <item>11. A square India-Cabinet, of odd nameless things. No 16.Â Â </item>
            </list> The numbers you see at the end (wch are also inscribed on the parcels) relate to the whole &amp; not to your part of them,
					therefore you need not take any notice of them. as to the danger of fire, nothing can be more combustible than the China-baskets, being
					of wicker and pack'd full of Tow, Paper-Shavings, &amp; Hay: wherever they are disposed, I should hope nobody would come with a candle.
					if the matted things fright you on the same account, the coverings may be taken off, &amp; laid by in some dry place. I like mightily
					your proposal of insuring; but I thought, they would not do it for China, Glasses, or Linnen. the value (including Mrs Forster's
					parcels) I should set at about 250Â£. I could not perhaps sell the contents for so much, but it is certain, that I could never buy them
					for that money. if it could be done immediately, I should be glad (supposing it be not any great trouble) tho' in about ten days I
					shall be in Town myself. will you let your Servant enquire, if my old lodgeings will be vacant at that
					time?</p>
         <p>It may be necessary to add a list of the remaining parcels, supposing you should think it right to insure all together. At Mrs
					Forster's <list>
               <item>1. An old leather Trunk nail'd, No 4, with Beds, Quilts, &amp; table-linnen, &amp;c.Â Â </item>
               <item>2. A Hand-basket, with a Kettle, Pewter, No 11. &amp; kitchen-utensils.Â Â </item>
               <item>3. An old Portmanteau, with servant's linnen, &amp;c: No 12.Â Â </item>
               <item>4. A Walnut-tree Escritoire, upper half, with quilting, a bed, toilettes, &amp; some China. matted. No 14.Â Â </item>
               <item>5. Lower Part of ye same, with Cushions, Curtains, Blankets, &amp; a few Books. No 15.Â Â </item>
               <item>6. Large Deal-Case with Looking-Glasses, No 19. Pictures, &amp;c:Â Â </item>
               <item>7, 8, 9, 10. Six chairs, &amp; a Settee â&#x80;&#x93;mattedâ&#x80;&#x93;No. XX, 1; 2; 3; &amp;
							4.Â Â </item>
               <item>11. A Deal Chest of Books ... No 21.Â Â </item>
            </list> there are some other trifles, but this all worth mention. </p>
         <p>I am glad you are master of a <hi rend="italic">PietÃ¡.</hi>
					 I could have said PietÃ¡ myself, if I had not left off being a Coxcomb or a Connoisseur. Palma (that
					is the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> one) was a good Colorist, like most of ye Venetians, but remarkable
					for bad drawing, particularly of hands &amp; arms. what you say of Dr. Ak: I fully agree with you in,
					&amp; have mention'd it to Mason. as soon as I can write to Mr. H:, I shall repeat to him a <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of your own words, wch I think will prevail, besides I know he thinks himself obliged to you in Dr.
						H:n's affair. I have seen no Rousseau, nor any body else: all I can
					tell you is, that I am to dine with my Lady Carlisle to-morrow, who is a melancholy Dowager reduced
					from Castle-Howard &amp; ten thousand Pound a-year to 1500Â£, her jewels, plate, &amp; a fine House in
					town excellently well-furnish'd. she has just discover'd too (I am told in confidence) that she has been long the object of Calumny,
					&amp; Scandal. what can I say to comfort her?</p>
         <p>I do not dislike the Laureat at all. to me it is his best Ode, but I don't expect any one should
					find it out; for Otbert &amp; Ateste are surely less known than Edw: the 1st, &amp; Mount
						Snowden. it is no imitation of me; but a good one of <q>
               <p>Pastor cum traheret &amp;c:</p>
            </q> wch was falsely laid to my charge.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu, Dear Sr, I am ever<lb/> Yours </salute>
            <dateline>Dec: 2. 1758. </dateline>

         <postscript>
            <p>P:S: If the China arrives safe &amp; without rattling, the Men will deserve something to drink, wch I shall be careful to repay:
						they promise to bring it on biers, not in a cart. in No 6 is the best of it. </p>
            <p>Pray, do you know any thing of Stonhewer? is he in London? </p>
