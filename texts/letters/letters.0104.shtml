            <div class="salute">Dear West,</div>
         </div>
         <p>I have advised with the most notable antiquarians of this city on the meaning of <span style="font-style:italic">Thur gut Luetis.</span> I can get no satisfactory interpretation. In my opinion 'tis Welsh. I don't love
            offering conjectures on a language in which I have hitherto made little proficiency,
            but I will trust you with my explication. You know the famous Aglaughlan, mother of
            Cadwalladhor, was renowned for her conjugal virtues, and grief on the death of her
            royal spouse. I conclude this medal was struck in her regency, by her express order,
            to the memory of her lord, and that the inscription <span style="font-style:italic">Thur gut Luetis</span> means no more than <span style="font-style:italic">her dear Llewis</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Llewellin.</span></p>
         <p>In return for your coins I send you two or three of different kinds. The first is
            a money of one of the kings of Naples; the device, a horse; the motto, <span style="font-style:italic">Equitas regni.</span> This curious pun is on a coin in the Great Duke's collection, and by great chance
            I have met with a second. Another is, a satirical medal struck on Lewis XIV.; 'tis
            a bomb, covered with flower-deluces, bursting; the motto, <span style="font-style:italic">Se ipsissimo.</span> The last, and almost the only one I ever saw with a text well applied, is a German
            medal with a rebellious town besieged and blocked up; the inscription, <span style="font-style:italic">This kind is not expelled but by fasting.</span></p>
         <p>Now I mention medals, have they yet struck the intended one on the taking of Porto
            Bello? Admiral Vernon will shine in our medallic history. We have just received the
            news of the bombarding Carthagena, and the taking Chagre. We are in great expectation
            of some important victory obtained by the squadron under sir John Norris: we are told
            the Duke is to be of the expedition: is it true? All the letters too talk of France's
            suddenly declaring war; I hope they will defer it for a season, or one shall be obliged
            to return through Germany.
         </p>
         <p>The Conclave still subsists, and the divisions still increase; it was very near separating
            last week, but by breaking into two popes; they were on the dawn of a schism. Aldovrandi
            had thirty-three voices for three days, but could not procure the requisite two more;
            the Camerlingo having engaged his faction to sign a protestation against him, and
            each party were inclined to elect. I don't know whether one should wish for a schism
            or not; it might probably rekindle the zeal for the church in the powers of Europe,
            which has been so far decaying.
         </p>
         <p>On Wednesday we expect a third she-meteor. Those learned luminaries the Ladies P[omfret]
            and W[alpole] are to be joined by the Lady M[ary] W[ortley] M[ontagu]. You have not
            been witness to the rhapsody of mystic nonsense which these two fair ones debate incessantly,
            and consequently cannot figure what must be the issue of this triple alliance: we
            have some idea of it. Only figure the coalition of prudery, debauchery, sentiment,
            history, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and metaphysics; all, except the second, understood
            by halves, by quarters, or not at all. You shall have the journals of this notable
            academy. Adieu, my dear West!

         <p>Though far unworthy to enter into so learned and political a correspondence, I am
            employed pour barbouiller une page de 7 pouces et demie en hauteur, et 5 en largeur;
            and to inform you that we are at Florence, a city of Italy, and the capital of Tuscany:
            the latitude I cannot justly tell, but it is governed by a prince called Great-duke;
            an excellent place to employ all one's animal sensations in, but utterly contrary
            to one's rational powers. I have struck a medal upon myself: the device is thus O,
            and the motto <span style="font-style:italic">Nihilissimo,</span> which I take in the most concise manner to contain a full account of my person, sentiments,
            occupations, and late glorious successes. If you choose to be annihilated too, you
            cannot do better than undertake this journey. Here you shall get up at twelve o'clock,
            breakfast till three, dine till five, sleep till six, drink cooling liquors till eight,
            go to the bridge till ten, sup till two, and so sleep till twelve again.

         </div>
         <p>We shall never come home again; a universal war is just upon the point of breaking
            out; all outlets will be shut up. I shall be secure in my nothingness, while you,
            that will be so absurd as to exist, will envy me. You don't tell me what proficiency
            you make in the noble science of defence. Don't you start still at the sound of a
            gun? Have you learned to say Ha! ha! and is your neck clothed with thunder? Are your
            whiskers of a tolerable length? And have you got drunk yet with brandy and gunpowder?
            Adieu, noble captain!
