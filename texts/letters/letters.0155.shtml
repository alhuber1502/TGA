         <div class="salute">My dear Wharton</div>
      </div>
      <p>I highly approve of your travelling Nuptials, &amp; only wonder you don't set forth on
         Easter-Day,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> rather than stay to be dish'd up there, &amp; put to Bed by a whole Heap of prurient
         Relations. I don't conceive what one can do with such People, but run away from them.
         my very Letter blushes to think it must speak with you at a Time when there is but
         one Person you can properly have any Thing to say to.
      </p>
      <p>However, tho' I have not the Pleasure of knowing Mr Wilkinson,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> my new Relation, much less of knowing how good a Charioteer he is: yet I will readily
         trust him with my Neck to carry to Stilton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or where he pleases. if I arrive there in a shatter'd Condition, I hope the Lady
         you belong to will receive me the more graciously, as a Person, that had an Ambition
         to break a Limb, or two in her Service. but you must desire him (as you say) to invite
         me.
      </p>
      <p>You shall receive the Money,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as soon as you get to Town. my Aunt<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has it in her Hands: when I see you, I shall learn your Direction, &amp; she shall come
         &amp; pay it. I won't trouble you with long Letters at present.
      </p>
