         <p>And so you have a garden of your own, &amp; you plant &amp; transplant &amp; are dirty &amp; amused! are not you ashamed of yourself?
					why, I have no so such thing, you monster; nor ever shall be either dirty or amused as long as I live! my gardens are in the
						window, like those of a Lodger up three pair of stairs in Petticoat-lane or Camomile-street, &amp; they go to bed regularly under the same roof that
					I do. dear, how charming it must be to walk out in one's own garding, &amp; sit on a bench in the open air with a fountain, &amp; a
					leaden statue, &amp; a rolling stone, &amp; an arbour! have a care of sore-throats tho', &amp; the <hi rend="italic">agoe.</hi>

					 has been rehearsed again &amp; again, &amp; the boys have got scraps by heart: I expect to see it
					torn piece-meal in the North-Briton, before it is born. the musick is as good as the words: the former might be taken for mine, &amp;
					the latter for Dr. Randal's. if you will come, you shall see it &amp; sing in it with Mr
						Norris, &amp; Mr Clerke, the Clergyman, and Mr Reinholt, &amp; Miss Thomas, great names at Salisbury &amp; Gloster musick-meeting,
					and well-versed in Judas-Maccab√¶us. Dr Marriott is to have Ld Sandwich &amp; the Attorney-General at his Lodge, not to mention foreign Ministers, who are to lie with Dr
					Hallifax, or in the stables. Ld North is at King's, Ld Weymouth at
					Mrs Arbuthnot's, they talk of the D: of Bedford, who (I suppose), has a bed in King's-Chappel. the Archbishop is to be at Christ's, Bps of London at Clare-Hall, of Lincoln at Dr Gordon's, of Chester at Peter-House,
					of Norwich at Jesus, of St David's at Caius, of Bangor, at the Dog &amp; Porridge-pot, Marq: of Granby at Woodyer's. the Yorkes &amp; Townshends will not come. Soulsby the Taylor lets his room for 11 guineas the 3 days,
					Woodyer aforesaid for 15. Brotherton asks 20. I have a bed over the way offer'd me at 3 half-crowns a night, but it may be gone, before
					you come. I believe, all that are unlett will be cheap, as the time approaches. I wish it were once over, &amp; immediately I go for a
					few days to London, &amp; so (with Mr Brown) to Aston, tho' I fear it will rain the whole summer, &amp; Skiddaw will be invisible &amp;
					inaccessible to mortals. I forgot to tell you, that on the Monday (after his Grace has breakfasted on a Divinity-act) twelve Noblemen
					&amp; Fellow-commoners are to settle his stomach with verses made &amp; repeated by themselves. Saturday next (you know) is the great day, &amp; he goes away on Monday after this repast.</p>

					 Voyage thro' Italy in 8 vol:s. he is a Member of the Acad: of Sciences, &amp; pretty good to read. I
					have read an 8vo volume of Shenstone's letters. poor Man! he was always wishing for money, for fame,
					&amp; other distinctions, &amp; his whole philosophy consisted in living against his will in retirement, &amp; in a place, wch his taste had adorn'd; but wch he only enjoy'd, when People of note came to see &amp; commend it. his
					correspondence is about nothing else but this place &amp; his own writings with two or three neighbouring Clergymen, who wrote verses
					too.</p>
         <p>I will send the Wilton-book directed to Payne for you, tho' I know it will be lost, &amp; then you
					will say, it was not worth above a shilling, wch is a great comfort to me. I have just found the beginning of a letter, wch somebody
					had drop'd: I should rather call it first thoughts for the beginning of a letter, for there are many scratches &amp; corrections. as I
					can not use it myself (having got a beginning already of my own) I send it for your use upon some great occasion.</p>
