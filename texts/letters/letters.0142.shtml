      </div>
      <p>You have not then forgot me, &amp; I shall see you again: it suffices, &amp; there needed
         no other Excuse. I loved You too well not to forgive you without a Reason; but I could
         not but be sorry for myself. </p>
      <p>You are lazy (you say) &amp; listless &amp; gouty &amp; old, &amp; vex'd and perplex'd: I am all that
         (the Gout excepted) &amp; many Things more, that I hope you never will be: so that what
         you tell me on that Head est trop flateux<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> pour moi: our Imperfections may at least excuse, &amp; perhaps recommend us to one another:
         methinks I can readily pardon Sickness &amp; Age &amp; Vexation for all the Depredations they
         make within &amp; without, when I think they make us better Friends &amp; better Men, wch
         I am persuaded is often the Case. I am very sure, I have seen the best-temper'd generous
         tender young Creatures in the World, that would have been very glad to be sorry for
         People they liked, when under any Pain, and could not; merely for Want of knowing
         rightly, what it was, themselves.</p>
      <p>I find Mr Walpole then made some Mention of me to you. yes, we are together again.
         it is about a Year, I believe, since he wrote to me to offer it, &amp; there has been
         (particularly of late) in Appearance the same Kindness &amp; Confidence almost as of old.
         what were his Motives I can not yet guess: what were mine, you will imagine, &amp; perhaps
         blame me.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> however as yet I neither repent, nor rejoice overmuch: but I am pleased. he is full,
         I assure you, of your Panegyric. never any body had half so much Wit as Mr Chute<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (wch is saying every thing with him, you know) &amp; Mr W.d is the finest young Man,
         that ever was imported.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I hope to embrace this fine Man (if I can) &amp; thank him heartily for being my Advocate,
         tho' in vain: he is a good Creature, &amp; I am not sure but I shall be tempted to eat
         a Wing of him with Sellery-Sauce<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Ã¢&#x80;&#x93; I am interrupted. whenever I know of your Time, I will be in Town presently.
         I can not but make Mrs Chute<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> my best Acknowledgements for takeing my Part. Heaven keep you all!</p>
