         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I have received two letters from you with one enclosed from Paris, &amp; one from Mason.
         I met poor Baker two or three days after the fire with evident marks of terror in
         his countenance: he has moved his quarters (I am told) somewhere into Gray's-inn Lane
         near the fields.
      </p>
      <p>I do not apprehend any thing more than usual from the City-remonstrance, &amp; the Party
         principally concern'd I hear does not in the least regard it. the conversation you
         mention in the house of Lords is very true: it happen'd about a fortnight since, &amp;
         the A:p  replied, it was not any concern of his, as he had received no complaint from
         the Un: on that head. it begins to be doubted, whether Ld Anglesey will carry his
         point, his witnesses being so very Irish in their understandings &amp; consciences, that
         they puzzle the cause they came to prove: but this can not be clear'd up till another
         session. Pa: &amp; I have often visited, but never met: I saw my Ld &amp; Tom the other day
         at breakfast in good health, &amp; Lady Maria did not beat me, but giggled a little. Mons:r
         de Villevielle has found me out, &amp; seems a sensible quiet young Man. he returns soon
         to France with the Embassador, but means to revisit England, &amp; see it better. I dined
         at Hampton-court on Sunday all alone with St:, who enquired after you, &amp; the next
         day with the same &amp; a good deal of company in Town. I have not seen him so well this
         long time. I am myself indifferent, the head-ach returns now &amp; then, &amp; a little grumbling
         of the gout, but I mean to see you on Monday or Tuesday next.
      </p>
