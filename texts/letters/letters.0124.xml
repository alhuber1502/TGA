         <p>Your fragment is in Aulus Gellius; and both it and your Greek delicious. But why are you thus
					melancholy? I am so sorry for it, that you see I cannot forbear writing again the very first opportunity; though I have little to say,
					except to expostulate with you about it. I find you converse much with the dead, and I do not blame you for that; I converse with them
					too, though not indeed with the Greek. But I must condemn you for your longing to be with them. What, are there no joys among the
					living? I could almost cry out with Catullus 'Alphene immemor, atque unanimis false sodalibus!' But to
					turn an accusation thus upon another, is ungenerous; so I will take my leave of you for the present with a 'Vale et vive paullisper cum
						vivis.'
