      <p>After a month's expectation of you, and a fortnight's despair, at Cambridge, I am
         come to town, and to better hopes of seeing you. If what you sent me last be the product
         of your melancholy, what may I not expect from your more cheerful hours? For by this
         time the ill health that you complain of is (I hope) quite departed; though, if I
         were self-interested, I ought to wish for the continuance of any thing that could
         be the occasion of so much pleasure to me. Low spirits are my true and faithful companions;
         they get up with me, go to bed with me, make journeys and returns as I do; nay, and
         pay visits, and will even affect to be jocose, and force a feeble laugh with me; but
         most commonly we sit alone together, and are the prettiest insipid company in the
         world. However, when you come, I believe they must undergo the fate of all humble
         companions, and be discarded. Would I could turn them to the same use that you have
         done, and make an Apollo of them. If they could write such verses with me, not hartshorn,
         nor spirit of amber, nor all that furnishes the closet of an apothecary's widow, should
         persuade me to part with them: But, while I write to you, I hear the bad news of Lady
         Walpole's death on Saturday night last. Forgive me if the thought of what my poor
         Horace must feel on that account, obliges me to have done in reminding you that I
         am
