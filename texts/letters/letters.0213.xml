            <salute>My dear Mason,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p> I am not in a way of leaving this place yet this fortnight, &amp; consequently shall hardly see you in town. I rejoice in the mean
					time to think, that you are there, &amp; have left (I hope) a part of your disagreable reflections in the place, where they grew. Stoke
					has revived in me the memory of many a melancholy hour, that I have pass'd in it, &amp; tho' I have
					no longer the same cause for anxiety, I do not find myself at all the happier for thinking, that I have lost it. as my thoughts now
					signify nothing to any one, but myself, I shall wish to change the scene, as soon as ever I can.</p>
         <p>I am heartily glad to hear Mr Hutton is so reasonable, but am rather sorry to find that
						design is known to so many. Dr Wharton, who (I suppose) heard it from Avison, mentions it in a letter to me. were I you, I should have taken some pleasure in observing people's faces,
					&amp; perhaps in putting their kindness a little to the tryal. it is a very useful experiment; &amp; very possibly you will never have
					it in your power to put it in practise again. pray, make your bargain with all the circumspection, &amp; selfishness of an old Hunks;
					when you are grown as rich as Crœsus, do not grow too good-for-nothing. a little good-for-nothing to be sure you will grow: every body
					does in proportion to their circumstances, else indeed what should one do with one's money? my third <hi rend="italic">Sentence</hi>
					is, don't anticipate your revenues, &amp; live upon air, till you know what you are worth. you bid me write no more than a scrall to
					you, therefore I will trouble you, as you are so busy, with nothing more. </p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu!<lb/> I am very sincerely &amp; affectionately <lb/> Yours </salute>

            <p>turn over </p>
            <p>I should be obliged to you, if you had time to ask at Roberts's, or some place in Jermyn-street,
						whether I could be there about a fortnight hence. I won't give more than ½ a guinea a week, nor put up with a second floor, unless it
						has a tolerable room to the street. will you acquaint me of this?</p>
