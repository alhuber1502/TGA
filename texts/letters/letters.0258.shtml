      <p>If you continue your intention of coming hither, Mr Chute desires, you would give
         yourself the trouble of looking among your prints (of Hollar or others) for an inside-view
         of St George's Chappel at Windsor, &amp; be so good to bring it with you. I have a notion,
         there is such a Print in Ashmole's Book of the Garter.

      <p>We have been up a second time for two days in our Chair, but are forced to lie in
         bed again today with the Gout in one ancle, yet with no great pain.
