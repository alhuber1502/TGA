         <div class="salute">My Dear Wharton</div>
      </div>
      <p>I rejoice to hear you are safe arrived, tho' drawn by <span style="font-style:italic">four wild Horses,</span> like People one reads of in the Book of Martyrs. yet I can not chuse but lament your
         Condition, so coop'd up in the Elvet-House<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with Spirits &amp; Hobgoblins about you, &amp; Pleasure at one Entrance quite shut out; you
         must so much the more set open all the other Avenues to admit it, open your Folio's,
         open your De L'Isle,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; take a Prospect of that World, wch the cruel Architect has hid from your corporeal
         Eyes, &amp; confined 'em to the narrow Contemplation of your own <span style="font-style:italic">Backside,</span> &amp; Kitchen Garden. Mr Keene<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been here, but is now gone to Town for a little While, &amp; returns to pass the
         Winter with us. we are tolerably gracious, &amp; he speaks mighty well of you: but when
         I look upon his countenance &amp; his Ways, I can never think of bestowing [Tuthill]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> upon him (tho' it were never so advantagious, &amp; they both had a Mind to it) and so
         I have said nothing to either of them. I found, he had no Hopes of your Petition;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; believe, you are right in thinking no farther of it. your Mention of Mr Vane,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> reminds me of poor Smart<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (not that I, or any other Mortal, pity him) about three Weeks ago he was arrested
         here at the Suit of a Taylor in London for a Debt of about 50£ of three Years standing.
         the College had about 28£ due to him in their Hands, the rest (to hinder him from
         going to the Castle,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for he could not raise a Shilling) Brown, May, &amp; Peele,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> lent him upon his Note. upon this he remain'd confined to his Room, lest his Creditors
         here should snap him; &amp; the Fellows went round to make out a List of his Debts, wch
         amount in Cambridge to above 350£. that they might come the readier to some Composition,
         he was advised to go off in the Night, &amp; lie hid somewhere or other. he has done so,
         &amp; this has made the Creditors agree to an Assignment of 50£ per ann: out of his Income,
         wch is above 140£, if he lives at Cambridge (not else). but I am apprehensive, if
         this come to the Ears of Mr Vane he may take away the 40£ hitherto allowed him by
         the Duke of Cleveland;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for before all this (last Summer) I know they talk'd of doing so, as Mr Smart (they
         said) was settled in the World. if you found an Opportunity, possibly you might hinder
         this (wch would totally ruin him now) by representing his Absurdity in the best Light
         it will bear: but at the same Time they should make this a Condition of its Continuance;
         that he live in the College, soberly, &amp; within Bounds, for that upon any Information
         to the Contrary it shall be absolutely stop'd. this would be doing him a real Service,
         tho' against the Grain: yet I must own, if you heard all his Lies, Impertinence, &amp;
         Ingratitude in this Affair, it would perhaps quite set you against him, as it has
         his only Friend (Mr Addison)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> totally. &amp; yet one would try to save him, for Drunkenness is one great Source of
         all this, &amp; he may change it. I would not tell this Matter in the North,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> were I you, till I found it was known by other Means. we have had an Opinion from
         the Attor:ny General<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in a manner directly contrary to the former. he does not seem to have been clear
         then; so that he may possibly not be so now. the Kings-Bench (he says) can take no
         Cognizance of it; the Visitor must do all, &amp; he is the Vice-Chancellor<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> by K: James's Charter, wch is good. this is sad indeed, &amp; the Fellows, before they
         acquiesce in it, seem desirous of consulting Dr Lee,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who is well acquainted with College-Matters.</p>
      <p>Have you seen Lyttelton's Monody<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on his Wife's Death? there are Parts of it too stiff &amp; poetical; but others truly
         tender &amp; elegiac, as one would wish. Dodsley is publishing three Miscellaneous Volumes;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> some new, many that have been already printed. Lyttelton, Nugent,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and G: West<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> have given him several Things of theirs. Mr W: has given him three Odes of mine<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (wch you have seen before) &amp; one of Mr West's (my Friend, who is dead) wch in Spite
         of the Subject is excellent: it is on the late Queen's Death.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there is a Mr Archibald Bower,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a Scotchman bred in Italy, Professour in three Universities there, &amp; of the Inquisition.
         he was employed by the Court of Rome to write a History of the Popes. as he searched
         into the Materials, his Eyes were open'd: he came to England, has changed his Religion,
         &amp; continues his Work in our Language under the Patronage of Mr Pitt, the Yorks, &amp;c:
         the Preface is come out with the Proposals,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; promises exceeding well. doubtless there is no part of History more curious, if
         it be well perform'd.</p>
      <p>My best wishes wait upon Mrs. Wharton, and —.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> my Compliments to Miss Wharton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; to King Harry, the 8th –<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> .
