				     <p>It is a mercy, that Old Men are mortal, &amp; that dignified Clergymen know how to keep their
						word. I heartily rejoice with you in your establishment, &amp; with myself that I have lived to see
					it, to see your insatiable mouth stopt, &amp; your anxious perriwig at rest &amp; slumbering in a stall. the Bp of London (you see) is dead: there is a fine opening. is there nothing farther to tempt you? feel your own pulse
					&amp; answer me seriously: it rains Precentorships, you have only to hold up your skirt, &amp; catch
					them.</p>
				     <p>I long to embrace you in your way to Court: I am still here: so are the Glasses &amp; their Master.
					the first still delight me; I wish I could say as much for the second. come however &amp; see us, such as we are. Mr Brown is overjoy'd
					at the news, yet he is not at all well.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>I am (wch is no wonder, being undignified &amp; much at leisure) entirely Yours,</salute>
