				     </opener>
				     <p> I thank you for your history of Melpomene, wch is curious, &amp; ought to be remember'd. the
					judgement of the knowing ones ought always to be upon record, that they may not be suffer'd to retract &amp; mitigate their applause:
					if I were Dodsley I would sue them, &amp; they should buckle my shoe in Westminster-Hall. what is the reason, I hear nothing of your
						<hi rend="italic">waiting,</hi>
					 &amp; your performances in publick? another thing. why has Mr H:s letter to you never been advertised, &amp; why do not I hear, what any body says about it?</p>
				     <p>I go from hence for three days on Wednesday next, &amp; hope your inoculation will not be so over,
					that you should come to Windsor, before I return: if I had notice in due time, I would meet you at the Christopher in Eton, or if you chuse it (you know the worst, having been already here) shall rejoice to see you at
					Stoke. in town I shall hardly be, till next month. our expedition is extremely a l'Angloise: but I
					have given up all thoughts of England, &amp; care for no body but the King of Prussia. pray, do not suffer your Megrims to prevail over
					you. it is good for you, that you should come <hi rend="italic">to school</hi> for a few months now &amp; then. I must say, no one has
					profited more in so few lessons. Common-Sense no where thrives better than in the neighbourhood of Nonsense.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>take care of your health, &amp; believe me ever<lb/> Yours </salute>
