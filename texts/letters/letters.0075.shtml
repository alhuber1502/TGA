         <div class="salute">My dear Ashton,</div>
      </div>
      <p>The exceeding Slowness and Sterility of me, &amp; this Place &amp; the vast abundance &amp; volubility
         of Mr Walpole &amp; his Pen will sufficiently excuse to you the shortness of this little
         matter. He insists that it is not him, but his Pen that is so volubility, &amp; so I have
         borrowd it of him; but I find it is both of 'em that is so volubility, for tho I am
         writing as fast, as I can drive, yet he is still chattering in vast abundance. I have
         desired me to hold his tongue, pho, I mean him, &amp; his, but his Pen is so used to write
         in the first Person, that I have screwd my finger &amp; thumb off, with forcing it, into
         the third. After all this confusion of Persons, &amp; a little stroke of Satyr upon me
         the Pen returns calmly back again into the old <span style="font-style:italic">I,</span> &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">me,</span> as if nothing had happend to tell you how much I am tired, &amp; how cross I am, that
         this cursed Scheme of Messrs. Selwyn<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Montague<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> should have come across all our Measures,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; broke in upon the whole year, which, what with the Month we have to wait for them,
         &amp; the Month they are to stay here, will be entirely slipt away, at least, the agreable
         Part of it, and if we journey at all, it will be thro' dirty roads, &amp; falling leaves.</p>
      <p>The Man, whose arguments you have so learnedly stated,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; whom you did not think fit to honour with a Confutation, we from thence conceive
         to be one, who does us honour, in thinking us fools, &amp; so you see, I lay my Claim
         to a share of the glory; we are not vastly curious about his Name, first because it
         don't signify, 2dly because we know it already: it is either Sr T: G: himself, or
         your friend Mr Fenton, if it's them we don't care, &amp; if it is not, we don't care neither,
         but if you care to convince the Man, whoever he be, that we are in some points not
         altogether fools, you might let him know that we are most sincerely</p>
