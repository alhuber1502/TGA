            <salute>Dear Mr Gray </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>It is not true that I again make interest to be transported into Ireland; and yet I beleive too it
					will be my fate. I am totally passive in the whole affair, and shall remain so, the only step I ever took, wch could be calld active,
					was to write a Letter to Mr Bonfoy, simply to enquire whether it was true that the Marquiss intended to take me next; wch he has now answerd in the affirmative; but as Louth is still to continue first Chaplain, the time when is uncertain, &amp; cannot be these two years, in wch
					space you know a Man may die or do a hundred pretty things. â&#x80;&#x93; But I hear, since I came into these parts, that Seward the
						Critic is very anxious about taking my Place, &amp; has made offers of making over to me a great
					living in the Peak, if he may go in my stead. Here too I preserve my Passivity. It being totally
					indifferent to me whether they thrust me into the Devil's Aâ&#x80;&#x93;e, or an Irish Bog.</p>
         <p>Yet, tho I say I am indifferent to both these, I will in my present circumstances embrace either. The world has nothing to give me
					that I really care for, therefore Whatever she gives me, or however she gives it, does not matter a rush. And yet I own I would have
					some thing more of her too, merely because I have not Philosophy, or a better thing Å&#x92;conomy, to make what I have a Competency.</p>
         <p>[ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  ]</p>
         <p>Whitehead has sent me some Verses from Vienna, treating of my Indolence, &amp; other weighty
					matters, &amp; exhorting me not to detach myself too much from the World. The Verses are really very easy, &amp; natural, &amp; I would
					transcribe them for you if it was not too much trouble. &amp; yet you would not like them, if I did; because of some Words, wch I know
					would not digest upon your Stomach; neither do they on mine; for I dont know how it is, but the slops you have given me have made my
					Digestive facultys so weak, that several things of that sort, wch were once as easy to me as hasty pudding, never get thro the first
					concoction, &amp; lay as heavy in the prima Via as toasted Cheese. All wch I impute to your Nursery, where you would never let one eat
					any thing that was solid, as I did at St Johns.
				</p>
         <p>"Write (you say) something stately at Aston." I writ nothing there but Sermons, &amp; those I only
					transcribd. Write yourself if you please, at least finish your Welch Ode &amp; send it me to Hull,
					for there is an Alderman there, that I want to give his opinion about it.</p>
         <p>But pray Why Mr Gray! must I write &amp; you Not? Upon my word Sr! I really dont mean it as a flattery or any thing of that sort, no
					Sr I detest the insinuation. but, Blast my Laurells Sr if I dont think you write vastly better than I do. I swear by Apollo (my dear
					Sr) That I would give all my Elfrida (Odes included) to be the Author of that pretty Elegy, that Miss
					Plumbtree can say off book. And I protest to you, that my Ode on Memory after it has gone through all
					the LimÃ¦ Labor that our friend Horace prescribes, Nay Si prematur Nonum in Annum (above half of wch
					time it has already I assure you been conceald Malgre my Partiality to it), I say that that very Ode is not, nor ever will be, half so
					terse, &amp; complete as the fragment of your Welch Ode; wch is as one may say now just warm from your Brain, &amp; one would expect as
					callow as a newhatchd Chicken (pardon the barndoor Simile) but all your productions are of a different sort, they come from you Armd
					Capapee at all points, as Minerva is said to have issued from the Head of Jupiter. I have thus said enough to shew you that however I
					may have laid aside the practical part of poetry I retain all that internal force, that Ignea vis, wch inspires evry true Son of
					parnassus with all wch I am fervently yours</p>

            <p>Pray give my best Compliments to Dr Wharton &amp; his Lady &amp; the ejected Statesman, and if
						youll write to me immediatly to Hull, Ill tell you when Ill meet you at Cambridge. Do you know what Whiteheads place is worth?â&#x80;&#x93;
