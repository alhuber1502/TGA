         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I received your letter, before I left London, &amp; sit down to write to you after the
         finest walk in the finest day, that ever shone, to Netley-Abbey, my old friend, with
         whom I long'd to renew my acquaintance.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> my Ferryman (for one passes over a little arm of the sea about 1/2 a mile) assured
         me, he would not go near it in the night-time for all the world, tho' he knew much
         money had been found there. the sun was <span style="font-style:italic">all too glaring &amp; too full of gauds</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for such a scene, wch ought to be visited only in the dusk of the evening. it stands
         in a little quiet valley, wch gradually rises behind the ruin into a half-circle crown'd
         with thick wood. before it on a descent is a thicket of oaks, that serves to veil
         it from the broad day &amp; from profane eyes, only leaving a peep on both sides, where
         the sea appears glittering thro' the shade, &amp; vessels with their white sails, that
         glide across &amp; are lost again. concealed behind the thicket stands a little Castle
         (also in ruins) immediately on the shore, that commands a view over an expanse of
         sea clear &amp; smooth as glass (when I saw it), with Southampton &amp; several villages 3
         miles off to the right, Calshot-Castle<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at 7 miles distance, &amp; the high lands of the Isle of Wight to the left, &amp; in front
         the deep shades of the New-Forest distinctly seen, because the water is no more than
         three miles over. the Abbey was never very large. the shell of its church is almost
         entire, but the pillars of the iles are gone, &amp; the roof has tumbled in, yet some
         little of it is left in the transept, where the ivy has forced its way thro', &amp; hangs
         flaunting down among the fretted ornaments &amp; escutcheons of the Benefactors. much
         of the lodgings &amp; offices are also standing, but all is overgrown with trees &amp; bushes,
         &amp; mantled here &amp; there with ivy, that mounts over the battlements.</p>
      <p>In my way I saw Winchester-Cathedral again with pleasure, and sup'd with Dr Balguy,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who, I perceive, means to govern the Chapter. they give 200£ a year to the Poor of
         the City: his present scheme is to take away this, for it is only an encouragement
         to laziness. but what do they mean to do with it? that indeed I omitted to enquire,
         because I thought, I knew. I saw <span style="font-style:italic">St Cross</span> too, the almshouse of <span style="font-style:italic">noble Poverty</span> (so it was call'd), founded by Henry de Blois,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Cardinal Beaufort.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it maintains 9 decay'd <span style="font-style:italic">Footmen,</span> &amp; a Master (Chancellor Hoadley)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who has 800£ a year out of it.</p>
      <p>This place is still full of <span style="font-style:italic">Bathers.</span> I know not a Soul, nor have once been at the rooms. the walks all round it are delicious,
         &amp; so is the weather. lodgings very dear &amp; fish very cheap. here is no Coffeehouse,
         no Bookseller, no Pastry-Cook: but here is the Duke of Chandos.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I defer my politicks. My service to Mr Talbot,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Gould,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c., &amp; to Mr Howe,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if with you.</p>
