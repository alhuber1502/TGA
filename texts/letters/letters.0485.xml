					       <salute>My Dear Sr </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I have received a second instance of your kindness &amp; confidence in me. and surely you hazard nothing in trusting me with the
					whole of your situation. it appears not to me so new, as it does to you. you well know, the tenour of my conversation (urged perhaps at
					times a little farther than you liked) has been intended to prepare you for this event, to familiarize your mind with this spectre,
					that you call by its worst name: but remember, that <hi rend="italic">Honesta res est l√¶ta paupertas.</hi>
					 I see it with respect, &amp; so will every one, whose poverty is not seated in their mind. there is
					but one real evil in it (take my word, who know it well) &amp; that is, that you have less the power of assisting others, who have not
					the same resources to support them. it is this consideration, that makes me remind you, that <hi rend="italic">Ansel</hi>
					 is lately dead, a Lay-fellow of your college. that if Dr M: (whose
					follies let us pardon, because he has some feeling &amp; means us well) be of little use, &amp; if Dr H: (another simple Friend of ours, perhaps with less sensibility) can not serve us in this: yet Dr R:
					is not immortal, you have always said to succeed him was not impracticable. I know it would be creditable, I know it would be
					profitable, I know it would in lieu of a little drudgery bring you freedom. that drudgery would with a little use grow easy. in the
					mean time, if any better prospect present itself, there you are ready to take advantage of the opportunity. in short this was always my
					favourite project, &amp; now more than ever for reasons, that will occur to yourself. in waiting for the accomplishment of it, you will
					take orders, &amp; if your Uncles are slow in their motions, you will accept a Curacy (for a title
					will be requisite) not under every body, that offers, but under some gentlemanlike friendly Man, &amp; in a christian country. a
					profession you must have: why not then accommodate yourself chearfully to its beginnings. you have youth, you have many kind
					well-intention'd people belonging to you, many acquaintance of your own, or familie's, that will wish to serve you. consider, how many
					have had the same, or greater cause for dejection with none of these resources before their eyes. </p>
				     <p>I am in Town for a month or more, &amp; wish to hear from you soon. Mr. W: has indeed been dangerously ill with the gout in his
					stomach, but nothing paralytick, as was said. he is much recover'd, &amp; gone to Bath.</p>
