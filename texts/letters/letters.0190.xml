         <p>I am at present at Stoke, to wch I came at half an Hour's Warning upon the News I received of my Mother's Illness, &amp; did not
					expect to have found her alive: but as I found her much better, &amp; she continues so, I shall be very glad to make you a Visit at
					Strawberry, whenever you give me Notice of a convenient time. I am surprized at the Print, wch far
					surpasses my Idea of London Graving. the Drawing itself was so finished, that I suppose, it did not require all the Art I had imagined
					to copy it tolerably. my Aunts just now, seeing me open your Letter, take it to be a Burying-Ticket
					enclosed, &amp; ask, whether any body has left me a Ring? and so they still conceive it to be, even with all their Spectacles on.
					heaven forbid they should suspect it to belong to any Verses of mine; they would burn me for a Poet. Mr Bentley (I believe) will catch
					a better Idea of Stoke-House from any old Barn he sees, than from my Sketch: but I will try my Skill. I forbid no Banes; but am
					satisfied, if your Design succeed so well as you intend it. and yet I know, it will be accompanied with something not at all agreeable
					to me.</p>
