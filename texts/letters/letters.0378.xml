         <p>I have been very ill this week with a great cold and a fever, and though now in a way to be well, am like to be confined some days
					longer: whatever you will send me that is new, or old, and <hi rend="italic">long,</hi> will be received as a charity. Rousseau's
						people do not interest me; there is but one character and one style in them all, I do not know their
					faces asunder. I have no esteem for their persons or conduct, am not touched with their passions; and as to their story, I do not
					believe a word of it â€“ not because it is improbable, but because it is absurd. If I had any little propensity, it was to Julie;
					but now she has gone and (so hand over head) married that monsieur de Wolmar, I take her for a <hi rend="italic">vraie Suissesse,</hi>
					and do not doubt but she had taken a cup too much, like her lover. All this does not imply that I
					will not read it out, when you can spare the rest of it.</p>
