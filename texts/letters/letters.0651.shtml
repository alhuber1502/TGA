      <h1>Portrait of Lord Granville</h1>
      <div class="q">
         <p>Commanding beauty, smoothed by cheerful grace,<br /> Sat on each opening feature of his face: <br /> Bold was his language, rapid, glowing, strong; <br /> And science flowed spontaneous from his tongue. <br /> With genius, seizing systems, slighting rules, <br /> And, void of gall, with boundless scorn of fools. <br /> Ambition dealt her flambeau to his hand, <br /> And Bacchus aided to illume the brand. <br /> His wish, to counsel monarchs or control; <br /> His means?—th' impetuous ardour of his soul; <br /> For Prudence, daring not to eye his aim, <br /> Lent not a pop-gun to bring down the game. <br /> Swift too the scaffold of his airy pride <br /> Fell—but slight-built, diffused no ruin wide. <br /> Unhurt, undaunted, undisturbed, he fell; <br /> Could laugh the same, and the same stories tell: <br /> And more a sage than he, who bade await <br /> His revels, till his conquests were complete, <br /> Our jovial statesman either sail unfurled, <br /> And drank his bottle, though he missed the world.</p>
