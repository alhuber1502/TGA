      </div>
      <p>I perceive, that mine<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> did not reach you, till the Day after you had wrote your little Letter. if you have
         time to give the Gentleman (before he goes to Town) my Note indorsed by You, or will
         send it to your Brother, the Money<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> shall be paid in Town at the Day you mention. the rest of my Questions are all sufficiently
         answer'd by the News you tell me (not but that I knew it before) what can one say
         to a Person in such Circumstances? I need not say, how much Happiness I wish you:
         if that be the Way to it, I rejoice to see you with your Boots on. it would be cruel
         to detain you long at present; when you have any Leisure, I hope you will let me a
         little more into the Matter. the Old Maids give you heartily Joy, &amp; hug themselves
         in their Virginity. Carlyon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is in your Room, &amp; I can't well go, &amp; strip him:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I reckon he will not remain long here. Adieu, &amp; think me
