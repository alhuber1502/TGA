      </div>
      <p>I perceive, that mine did not reach you, till the Day after you had wrote your little
         Letter. if you have time to give the Gentleman (before he goes to Town) my Note indorsed
         by You, or will send it to your Brother, the Money shall be paid in Town at the Day
         you mention. the rest of my Questions are all sufficiently answer'd by the News you
         tell me (not but that I knew it before) what can one say to a Person in such Circumstances?
         I need not say, how much Happiness I wish you: if that be the Way to it, I rejoice
         to see you with your Boots on. it would be cruel to detain you long at present; when
         you have any Leisure, I hope you will let me a little more into the Matter. the Old
         Maids give you heartily Joy, &amp; hug themselves in their Virginity. Carlyon is in your
         Room, &amp; I can't well go, &amp; strip him: I reckon he will not remain long here. Adieu,
         &amp; think me
      </p>
