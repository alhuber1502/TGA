            <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>It grieves me to hear the bad account you give of our poor Patient's health. I will not trouble you to enquire into the opinions of
					her Physicians: as you are silent on that head, I doubt you are grown weary of the inutility of their applications. I (you will
					remember) am at a distance, &amp; can not judge (but by conjecture) of the progress her disorder seems to make, &amp; particularly of
					that increasing weakness, wch seems indeed an alarming symptom. I am told, that the sea-air is advised as likely to be beneficial,
					&amp; that Ld H: offers you the use of Walmer-Castle, but that you wait till the spring is more
					advanced to put this in execution. I think, I should by no means delay at all. the air of the coast is at all seasons warmer, than that
					of the inland-country: the weather is now mild &amp; open, &amp; (unless the rains increase) fit for travelling. remember, how well she
					bore the journey to London; &amp; it is certain, that sort of motion in her case instead of fatigue often brings an accession of
					strength. I have lately seen that coast, &amp; been in Deal-Castle, wch is very similar in situation
					to Walmer &amp; many other little neighbouring forts. no doubt, you may be very well lodged &amp; accommodated there: the scene is
					delightful in fine weather, but in a stormy day &amp; high wind (and we are but just got so far in the year as the middle of February)
					exposed to all the rage of the sea, &amp; full force of the East: so that to a Person unused to the sea, it may be even dreadful. my
					idea therefore is, that you might go at present to Ramsgate, wch is shelter'd from the North, &amp; opening only to S: &amp; S:E:, with
					a very fine pier to walk on. it is a neat Town, seemingly with very clean houses to lodge in, &amp;
					one end of it only running down to the shore. it is at no season much pester'd with company, &amp; at present I suppose there is no
					body there. if you find Mrs Mason the better for this air &amp; situation (wch God send) when May &amp; fine settled weather come in,
					you will easily remove to Walmer, wch at that season will be delightful to her. if–forgive me for supposing the worst: your
					letter leaves me too much reason to do so, tho' I hope it was only the effect of a melancholy imagination. if it should be necessary to
					meet the spring in a milder climate than ours is: you are very near Dover, &amp; perhaps this expedient (if she grow very visibly
					worse) may be preferable to all others, &amp; ought not to be defer'd. it is usually too long delay'd.</p>
         <p>There are a few words in your letter, that make me believe, you wish I were in Town. I know myself, how little one like me is form'd
					to support the spirits of another, or give him consolation: one that always sees things in their most gloomy aspect. however be
					assured, I should not have left London while you were in it, if I could well have afforded to stay there till the beginning of April,
					when I am usually there. this however shall be no hindrance, if you tell me, it would signify any thing to you, that I should come
					sooner.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu! you (both of you) have my best &amp; sincerest good wishes. I am ever <lb/> Yours </salute>
            <signed>T G: </signed>
         </closer>
         <postscript>
            <p>P:S:–Remember, if you go into Kent, that W. Robinson lives at Denton (8 miles from Dover) perhaps he &amp; his Wife might be of some little use to you. him you know; &amp; for her she is a very good-humour'd, chearful
						Woman, that (I dare swear) would give any kind of assistance in her power. remember too to take whatever medecines you use with you
						from London: a countrey Apothecarie's shop is a terrible thing.
					</p>
            <p>My respects to Dr Gisburne, &amp; love to Stonhewer. when you have leisure &amp; inclination, I should be very glad to hear from
						you. need I repeat my kindest good wishes to Mrs Mason! </p>
