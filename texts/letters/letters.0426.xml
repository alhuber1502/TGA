            <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>You may well wonder at my long taciturnity: I wonder too, &amp; know not what cause to assign, for
					it is certain, I think of you daily. I believe, it is owing to the nothingness of my history, for except six weeks that I pass'd in
					Town towards the end of spring, &amp; a little jaunt to Epsom &amp; Box-Hill, I have been here time
					out of mind in a place, where no events grow, tho' we preserve those of former days by way of <hi rend="italic">Hortus Siccus</hi> in
					our libraries. my slumbers were disturbed the other day by an unexpected visit from Mr. W: who dined with me, seem'd mighty happy for
					the time he stay'd, &amp; said he could like to live here: but hurried home in the evening to his new
						Gallery, wch is all Gothicism, &amp; gold, &amp; crimson, &amp; looking-glass. he has purchased at an auction in Suffolk ebony-chairs &amp; old
					moveables enough to load a waggon.</p>
         <p>Mason &amp; I have received letters from Count Algarotti, Chambellan de sa Majeste le Roi de Prusse, with observations, (that is
					panegyricks) on our Tragedies &amp; our Odes, &amp; a present of certain Italian Dissertations, wch he has lately publish'd on the
					state of Painting and Musick. one of them is dedicated to Mr. Pitt, whom he styles â€“ <hi rend="italic">Uomo immortale, e
						Restitutore d'Inghilterra, Amico del gran Federigo.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I was in Town, when Mr Middleton died, &amp; immediately got all the information I could (first
					from St:r &amp; then from your Brother) of the dispositions he had made. I suppose, they are as good as you expected, &amp; tho' the
					prospect is but small, that you should enjoy the benefit of them in your own person, yet that is not impossible; &amp; your Son (I
					think) stands a very good chance, wch can not chuse but open an agreeable prospect to you, in wch I take a part, &amp; congratulate you
					both upon it. I doubt you have not read Rousseau's <hi rend="italic">Emile</hi>: every body that has
					children, should read it more than once, for tho' it abounds with his usual glorious absurdity, tho' his general scheme of education be
					an impracticable chimera: yet there are a thousand lights struck out, a thousand important truths better express'd than ever they were
					before, that may be of service to the wisest Man. particularly I think he has observed children with more attention &amp; knows their
					meaning &amp; the working of their little passions better than any other Writer. as to his religious discussions, wch have alarmed the
					world, &amp; engaged their thoughts more than any other part of his book, I set them all at nought, &amp; wish they had been omitted.
					Mrs Jonathan told me, you begun your evening-prayer as soon as I was gone, &amp; that it had a great
					effect upon the congregation: I hope you have not grown weary of it, nor lay it aside, when company comes. poor Mrs. Bonfoy (who taught me to pray) is dead. she struggled near a week against the Iliac Passion (I fear) in great
					torture with all her senses about her, &amp; with much resolution took leave of her physician some days before she expired, &amp; would
					suffer no one to see her afterwards but common Servants. </p>
         <p>You describe Winston
					<hi rend="italic">con tanto amore,</hi> that I take it amiss I was not suffer'd to see it, &amp; want to be buried there too. but
					enough of death! I have forgot to tell you that Dr. Long has had an audience of the K: &amp; Queen an hour long at
						Buckingham-House. his errand was to present them with a Lyricord
					(such a one!) of his own making, &amp; a glass-sphere: he had long been solliciting this honour, wch Ld Bute at last procured him,
					&amp; he is very happy. the K: told him, he bid fair for a century of life at least; ask'd him,
					whether he preach'd; why he did not write verses in the Cambridge Collection; &amp; what not? The Q.
					spoke French to him, &amp; ask'd, how he liked Handel?</p>
         <p>And I ask you, how you like the present times? whether you had not rather be a Printer's Devil, than a Secretary of State? you are to
					expect (I hear) a new Ministry, composed of the Earl of Shelburne,
					Mr Rigby, Duke &amp; Dutchess of Bedford, Earl Gower, &amp;c. which doubtless will give universal satisfaction. the great Ld Holland, who is at Paris, being lately asked by a young Man, who was returning home, whether he had any commands in
					England, made no reply but by shrugging up his shoulders, &amp; fetching a deep sigh.</p>
         <p>I kept an exact account of Heat &amp; Cold in the Spring here: the sum &amp; substance of wch is, that (at 9 in the morning) on the
					18th of January, the Therm: was at 31, &amp; the small birds were so tame you might take them up with your hand. this was the greatest
					cold. on the 15th of April it was at 58, &amp; the same afternoon at 65, wch was the greatest heat from Jan: 1 to May 1st. </p>
