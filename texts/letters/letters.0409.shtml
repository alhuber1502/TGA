      <p>I return you my best thanks for the copy of your book,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which you sent me, and have not at all lessened my opinion of it since I read it
         in print,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> though the press has in general<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a bad effect on the complection of one's works. The engravings look, as you say,
         better than I had expected, yet not altogether so well as I could wish. I rejoice
         in the good dispositions of our court, and in the propriety of their application to
         you: the work is a thing so much to be wished; has so near a connection with the turn
         of your studies and of your curiosity; and might find such ample materials among your
         hoards and in your head; that it will be a sin if you let it drop and come to nothing,
         or worse than nothing, for want of your assistance. The historical part should be
         in the manner of Henault,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a mere abridgement, a series of facts selected with judgment, that may serve as a
         clue to lead the mind along in the midst of those ruins and scattered monuments of
         art, that time has spared.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> This would be sufficient, and better than Montfaucon's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> more diffuse narrative. Such a work (I have heard) Mr. Burke<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is now employed about, which though not intended for this purpose might be applied
         perhaps to this use. Then at the end of each reign should come a dissertation explanatory
         of the plates, and pointing out the turn of thought, the customs, ceremonials, arms,
         dresses, luxury, and private life, with the improvement or decline of the arts during
         that period. This you must do yourself, beside taking upon you the superintendence,
         direction, and choice of materials. As to the expence, that must be the king's own
         entirely, and he must give the book to foreign ministers and people of note; for it
         is obvious no private man can undertake such a thing without a subscription, and no
         gentleman will care for such an expedient; and a gentleman it should be, because he
         must have easy access to archives, cabinets, and collections of all sorts. I protest
         I do not think it impossible but they may give into such a scheme: they approve the
         design, they wish to encourage the arts and to be magnificent, and they have no Versailles
         or Herculaneum.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I hope to see you toward the end of March. If you bestow a line on me, pray tell me
         whether the baronne de la Peyriere<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is gone to her castle of Viry; and whether Fingal<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> be discovered or shrewdly suspected to be a forgery.</p>
