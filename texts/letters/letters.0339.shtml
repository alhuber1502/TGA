      </div>
      <p>You will receive tomorrow Caractacus piping hot,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I hope before any body else has it. observe, it is I, that send it, for M: makes
         no presents to any one whatever, &amp; moreover you are desired to lend it to nobody,
         that we may sell the more of them; for money, not fame,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is the declared purpose of all we do. I believe, you will think it (as I do) greatly
         improved: the last Chorus, &amp; the lines that introduce it, are to me one of the best
         things I ever read, &amp; surely superior to any thing he ever wrote. he has had infinite
         fits of affectation, as the hour approach'd; &amp; is now gone into the country for a
         week, like a new-married Couple.
      </p>
      <p>I am glad to find, you are so lapt in Musick<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Cambridge, &amp; that Mingotti<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is to crown the whole. I heard her within this fortnight, &amp; think her voice (wch
         always had a roughness) is considerably harsher, than it was, but yet she is a noble
         Singer. I shall not partake of these delights,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> nor I fear be able to see Cambridge for some time yet:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but in a week I shall know better. Dr Wharton (who desires his love to you) will
         (I believe) set out for Durham in about three weeks to settle at Old-Park:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at present his least Girl<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is ill of the Small-Pox join'd with a scarlet Fever, but likely to get over it. yesterday
         I, &amp; M:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> dined with Mr Bonfoy:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he told me, that the old Lady<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was eloped from Rippon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> just at a time, when he seem'd to want her there, &amp; was (I thought) a little ruffled
         at it. but I (in my heart) commended her, &amp; think her very well <span style="font-style:italic">revenged</span> upon him. pray, make her my best Compliments. Old Turner<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is very declining, &amp; I was sounded<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> by Dr G: of Lincoln<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> about my designs (or so I understood it). I assured him, I should not <span style="font-style:italic">ask</span> for it, not chusing to be refused. he told me two People had applied already. N:B:
         (all this is a secret.)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
