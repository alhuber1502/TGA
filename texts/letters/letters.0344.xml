					       <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>The season for triumph is at last come; I mean for our Allies, for it will be long enough before we shall have reason to exult in any
					great actions of our own, &amp; therefore, as usual, we are proud for our neigbours. Contades' great army is entirely defeated: this (I am told) is undoubted, but no particulars are known as yet; &amp;
					almost as few of the other victory over ye Russians, wch is lost in the splendor of this greater
					action. so much for war, &amp; now come and see me in my peaceful new settlement, from whence I have the command of Highgate,
					Hampstead, Bedford-Gardens, &amp; the Musæum. this last (as you will imagine) is my favourite Domain, where I often pass four hours in
					the day in the stillness &amp; solitude of the reading room, wch is uninterrupted by any thing but Dr Stukeley the Antiquary, who comes there to talk nonsense, &amp; Coffee-house news. the rest of the Learned are (I
					suppose) in the country; at least none of them come there, except two Prussians, &amp; a Man, who writes for Ld Royston. when I call it peaceful, you are to understand it only of us Visiters, for the Society itself, Trustees,
					&amp; all, are up in arms, like the Fellows of a College. the Keepers have broke off all intercourse with one another, &amp; only lower
					a silent defiance, as they pass by. Dr Knight has wall'd up the passage to the little-House, because some of the rest were obliged to pass by one of his windows in the way to it. moreover the trustees
					lay out 500£ a year more than their income; so you may expect, all the books &amp; the crocodiles will soon be put up to auction. the
					University (we hope) will buy.</p>
				     <p>I have not (as you silently charge me) forgot Mosheim. I enquired long ago &amp; was told there
					were none in England, but Nourse expects a cargo every day, &amp; as soon as it comes, you shall have
					it. Mason never writes; but I hear, he is well, from Dr Gisbourne. do not pout, but pray let me hear
					from you, &amp; above all do, come &amp; see me, for I assure you, I am not uncomfortably situated for a Lodger, &amp; what are we, but
						Lodgers?</p>
