					       <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I beleive you are quite right, as you always are in these matters. But it is a little hard upon my no-reading, to beleive I have not
					read Keisler. I have I assure you, and he led me into the mistake. He has a Chapter on the notions the
					northern nations had of a future state. first of all he talks of the Metempsichosis wch every body allows Druidical (except
						Pelloutier.) &amp; then says 'Hi qui sine animarum transmigratione aliam post obitum vitam superesse
					statuebant, duplices primo animarum sedes faciebant. Alius enim status erat earum ante CREPUSCULUM
					DEORUM alius post illud.' &amp; then goes on to describe His Hell &amp; his Valhalla. But Sr W. Temple set me right about the low date
					of these Ideas before I recd yours. I have therefore laid aside the Ode, &amp; shall make no use of it
					at all, except perhaps the Image of the Armed Death wch is my own, &amp; neither Scaldic nor runic. &amp; as to this nasty German
					Keisler who led me to take all this trouble, Ill never open him again. The fool was a fellow of the Royal Society what could one expect
					better from him.</p>
				     <p>But after all, I do wish indeed that these Odes were all of them finishd, &amp; yet by what you talk of Measure &amp; Rhythm &amp;
					expression I think I shall never be able to finish them, never certainly at all if Im not to throw out my Ideas at large. So whether I
					am right or wrong I must have my way in that, Therefore talk no more about it. – Well you like my other Ode however – So
					Ill turn Wit, tho that, according to Popes gradation to <hi rend="italic">plain fool,</hi> should have come before <hi rend="italic">Poetry.</hi>
					 However as times go, tis well, it comes any how. But hold, I cannot part with Poetry till it has
					servd me a few friendly turns, &amp; when it has done that it may go to Fobus if it pleases, or to the Devil. One of these friendly
					turns it has done already &amp; you will have it enclosed if my excellent Fraser transcribes it in Time. Let me have your Strictures speedily, because I want to send it to Wood. take notice the lines descriptive of his Garden are strictly <hi rend="italic">peculiar,</hi> &amp;
						Whitehead who has seen the place tells me they are the very thing, nothing can be conceivd so flowry
					so fragrant &amp; so Shady as the foreground nothing more extensive &amp; riant than the Offskip.
				</p>
				     <p>Yet I can't let this elegy come to you without begging that as you are stout you will be merciful to it, for I feel for it somehow as
					if it was a favrite Child, and I will give you a Hundred Druidical Odes, to burn in your Critical Colossus, if youll let it live. Lord!
					I know nothing of Dupps being made Chancellor of the exchequer unless its a thing of course after hes
					made recorder of Cambridge, sure you had your intelligence from Mr Alderman Marshall. Dont beleive a
					Word what the papers tell you, that the Childs name was Mary, twas Concubinage, &amp; Dr
						Shebbeare is to teach it its Catechize.</p>
				     <p>Pray Mr Gray! why wont you make your Muse do now and then a friendly turn? An Idle Slut as she is! If she was to throw out her Ideas
					never so carelessly it would satisfy some folks that I know, but I wont name names, &amp; therefore I wont sign all the nonsence I have
					written. </p>

				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p>Do you know if Pelloutier ever publishd a third volume of His Histoire des Celtes. Dr W has only sent me two, &amp; I find the third was to contain their ceremonials wch is all I want.</p>
					       <p>Pray direct me to the passage, I have seen somewhere, like this Est Genus Hominum tam <hi rend="italic">Umbratile,</hi>
							&amp;c. I fancy it would make a good motto, If not Locus est et pluribus Umbris is no bad one.</p>
