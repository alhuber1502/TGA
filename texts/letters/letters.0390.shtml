      <p>Be assured he<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> never will die, so the better the thing is in value, the worse for you. the true
         way to immortality is to get you nominated one's Successor: Age &amp; Diseases vanish
         at your name, Fevers turn to radical heat, &amp; Fistulas to issues: it is a judgement
         that waits on your insatiable Avarice. you could not let the poor old Man die at his
         ease, when he was about it, &amp; all his family (I suppose) are cursing you for it.</p>
      <p>I should think your motions, if you are not perverse, might be so contrived as to
         bring you hither for a week or two in your way to the Coronation, &amp; then we may go
         together to Town, where I must be early in September. do, &amp; then I will help you to
         write a bawdy Sermon on this happy occasion. our friend Jemmy Bickham<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is going off to a living (better than 400£ a-year) somewhere in the neighbourhood
         of Mr Hurd;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; his old Flame, that he has nursed so many years, goes with him: I tell you this
         to make you pine.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Ld John<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on his recovery, &amp; he answers me very chearfully, as if his illness had been but
         slight, &amp; the Pleuresy were no more than a hole in one's stocking. he got it (he says)
         not by scampering, &amp; racketing, &amp; heating his blood, as I had supposed: but by going
         with Ladies to Vauxhall. he is the picture (&amp; pray so tell him, if you see him) of
         an old Alderman,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that I knew, who after living 40 years on the fat of the land, (not milk &amp; honey,
         but arrack-punch &amp; venison) &amp; losing his great toe with a mortification, said to the
         last, that he owed it to two grapes, wch he eat one day after dinner. he felt them
         lie cold at his stomach the minute they were down.</p>
      <p>Montagu<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (as I guess, at your instigation) has earnestly desired me to write some lines to
         be put on a Monument, wch he means to erect at Bellisle. it is a task I do not love,
         knowing Sr W: W:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> so slightly as I did: but he is so friendly a Person, &amp; his affliction seem'd to
         me so real, that I could not refuse him. I have sent him the following verses,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch I neither like myself, nor will he, I doubt. however I have shew'd him, that
         I wish'd to oblige him. tell me your real opinion.</p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>Here foremost in the dang'rous paths of fame <br /> Young Williams fought for England's fair renown: <br /> His mind each Muse, each Grace adorn'd his frame, <br /> Nor Envy dared to view him with a frown. <br /> At Aix uncall'd his maiden-sword he drew <br /> (There first in blood his infant-glory seal'd) <br /> From fortune, pleasure, science, love, he flew, <br /> And scorn'd repose, when Britain took the field. <br /> With eyes of flame &amp; cool intrepid breast <br /> Victor he stood on Bellisle's rocky steeps: <br /> Ah gallant Youth!–this marble tells the rest, <br /> Where melancholy Friendship bends, &amp; weeps.</p>
