         <div class="dateline">From Cambridge, 1735.</div><br /> In the style of Addison's <span style="font-style:italic">Travels.</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> 
         <div class="salute">Dear Sir,</div>
      </div>
      <p>I believe you saw in the newspapers that I was going to make the tour of Italy;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I shall therefore give you some account of the places I have seen, which are not
         to be found in Mr. Addison, whose method I shall follow.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> On 9th of Octr., 1735, we set out from Lodone<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1">London.</span> (the Lugdunum of the Ancients), the capital city of Lombardy, in a chariot-and-four.
         About 11 o'clock, we arrived at a place the Italians call Tempialbulo.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note2">White-chapel.</span> Virgil seems to have prophesied of this town when he says–
      </p>
      <div class="q"><span style="font-style:italic">Amisit verum vetus Albula nomen.</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> 
         <p>By <span style="font-style:italic">Time</span> the founder's great design was crost, And <span style="font-style:italic">Albula</span> its genuine title lost.
         </p>
      </div>
      <p>Here are no remains of Roman antiquity but a statue of Marc Aurelius,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note3">Statue of King William at a stone-cutter's.</span> which the Lombards call Guglielmo Terzo, one of their kings, and some learned men<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note4">See Addison, <span class="titlem">Trav.</span>, p. 26.<a class="link_ref" href="tg1b.4fm"></a></span> St. George and the Dragon. It is an equestrian statue, and almost equal to that of
         Charlemagne, at the Great Cross,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note5">Statue of King Charles at Charing Cross.</span> at Lodone. The church is an old Gothic building, and reckoned the most ancient in
         Italy. Here was some time ago an altar-piece of the Lord's Supper, in which the painter
         having quarrelled with the Abbot<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note6">Dr. White Kennet, Bishop of Peter-borough.</span> of this church, represented him like Judas,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with this epigram:–
      </p>
      <div class="q"><span style="font-style:italic">Falleris, hâc qui te pingi sub imagine credis,</span><br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Non similis Judas est tibi–poenituit.</span> <br /> <br /> Think not, vain man, thou here art represented, <br /> Thou art not like to <span style="font-style:italic">Judas</span>–he repented.
      </div>
      <p>From thence we made the best of our way to a town, which in English we should call
         Stony-Stratford, and corresponds with the description which Virgil has given of it–
      </p>
      <div class="q">– <span style="font-style:italic">vivo praetervehor Ostia Saxo<br /> Stratfordi, Megarosque sinus, Tapsumque iacentem.</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></div>
      <p>Those that follow are little dirty towns, that seem to have been built only to be
         'knocked<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note7">Expression of Addison on this line.</span>' on the head, like
      </p>
      <div class="q"><span style="font-style:italic">Antitheum, Glaucumque, Medontaque, Thersilochumque.</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></div>
      <p>The next town of note is Arc,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note8">Bow.</span> so called from its being built in the shape of a bow–<span style="font-style:italic">ab Eoo curvatur in Arcum.</span> From Arc we travelled through a very pleasant country to Epino,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note9">Epping.</span> whose forest is celebrated by Virgil in these lines:–
      </p>
      <div class="q"><span style="font-style:italic">Sylva Epini latè dumis, atque ilice nigrâ</span><br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Horrida, quam densi complerant undique sentes;</span><br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Rara per occultos ducebat semita calles.</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <br /> <br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Epinum's</span> woods with shrubs and gloomy oak<br /> Horrid, and all with brambles thick o'ergrown, <br /> Through which few narrow paths obscurely led. <br /> <span class="bibl"><span style="font-style:italic">Mr. Trap.</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></span></div>
      <p>We were here shown, at a distance, the thickets rendered so famous by the robberies
         of Gregorio.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note10">Gregory, a noted highwayman. See Addison, <span class="titlem">Trav.</span>, p. 1.<a class="link_ref" href="tg1b.10fm"></a></span> Here I was met by a very distant and troublesome relation. My namesake hints at such
         an one in those lines of his–
      </p>
      <div class="q"><span style="font-style:italic">Accurrit quidam notus mihi nomine tantùm</span><br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Arreptâque manu, Quid agis, Cosinissime, rerum?</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> <span class="bibl">Horace.</span><br /> <br /> There stepp'd up one to me I hardly knew, <br /> Embraced me, and cried, Cousin, how d'ye do? <br /> <span class="bibl"><span style="font-style:italic">Mr. Creech.</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></span></div>
      <p>We lay that night at Oggerell,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note11">Hockerel.<a class="link_ref" href="tg1b.11fm"></a></span> which is famous for nothing but being Horace's Oppidulo, <span style="font-style:italic">quod versu dicere non est.</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>In our way to Parvulun,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note12">Littlebury.</span> we saw a great castle,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note13">Audley Inn, the seat of the Earl of Suffolk.</span> belonging to the Counts of Suffolcia: it is a vast pile of building, but quite in
         the old taste. Parvulun is a small village, but formerly remarkable for several miracles,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note14">Winstanley's Wonders, or Tricks in Mechanics.</span> said to be performed there by a Welsh saint,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who, like Jupiter, was suckled by a goat, whence they think it
      </p>
      <div class="q"><span style="font-style:italic">Porrum et Caepe nefas violare.</span> Juv.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></div>
      <p>The wonders of Parvulun are in great repute all over Lombardy. We have very bad ways
         from hence to Pont Ossoria,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note15">Bone Bridge.</span> where are the ruins of a bridge that gives name to the town. The account they give
         of it is as follows:–St. Bona being desirous to pass over the river, met with a man
         who offered to carry her over; he took her up in his arms, and under pretence of doing
         her service, was going to ravish her; but she praying to the Virgin Mary for help,
         the wretch fell into the stream and was drowned, and immediately this bridge rose
         out of the water for her to go over. She was so touched with this signal deliverance,
         that she would not leave the place, but continued there till her death in exercises
         of devotion, and was buried in a little chapel at the foot of the bridge, with her
         story at length and this epitaph–<span style="font-style:italic">Hâc sita sunt fossâ Bonae Venerabilis ossa!</span><span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note16">Epitaph of Venerable Bede.</span></p>
      <p>From Pont Ossoria we travelled by land to Nuovo Foro<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note17">New-market.</span> (the Novum Forum of Jockius), where are held the greatest races in all Italy. We
         were shown in the treasury of the Benedictines' Convent an ancient gold cup which
         cost an hundred guineas (a great sum in those days),<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and given, as the friar told us that attended us, by a certain German Prince, he
         did not very well know who, but he believed his name was one King George.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note18">See p. 78.</span> The inhabitants are wonderfully fond of horses, and to this day tell you most surprising
         stories of one Looby, a Boltognian. I saw a book dedicated to the head of that family,
         intituled <span style="font-style:italic">A Discourse on the Magnanimity of Bucephalus, and of the Duke of Boltogne's Horse
            Looby.</span><span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note19">See p. 30.<a class="link_ref" href="tg1b.18fm"></a> Duke of Bolton. <a class="link_ref" href="tg1b.19fm"></a></span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I staid here three days, and in my way to Pavia<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note20">Cambridge.</span> stopped at the Palace of Delfini,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note21">Lord Godolphin's house on Gogmagog Hills.</span> which is built on the top of a large barren mountain, and at a distance looks like
         the Ark resting on Mount Ararat. This mountain is called Gog, and opposite to one
         called Magog. They are very dangerous precipices, and occasioned the famous verse
         –
      </p>
      <div class="q"><span style="font-style:italic">Incidit in Gogum qui vult vitare Magogon.</span><span class="notemarginLeft" id="Note22">Incidit in Scyllam qui vult vitare Charibdim.</span></div>
      <p>I need not repeat the history of Gog and Magog, it being known to every child, and
         to be found at large in most books of travels. 
      </p>
      <p>Pavia and its University are described by Mr. Addison, so I shall only mention a circumstance
         which I wonder escaped that learned gentleman. It is the name of the town, which is
         derived from the badness of the streets: <span style="font-style:italic">Pavia à non pavendo,</span> as <span style="font-style:italic">Lucus à non lucendo.</span></p>
      <p>Till next post, adieu! </p>
