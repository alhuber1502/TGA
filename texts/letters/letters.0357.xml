				     <p>I am so charmed with the two specimens of Erse poetry, that I cannot help giving you the trouble to
					enquire a little farther about them, and should wish to see a few lines of the original, that I may form some slight idea of the
					language, the measures, and the rhythm.
				</p>
				     <p>Is there anything known of the author or authors, and of what antiquity are they supposed to be? </p>
				     <p>Is there any more to be had of equal beauty, or at all approaching to it?
				</p>
				     <p>I have been often told that the poem called Hardicanute (which I always admired, and still admire) was the work of somebody that
					lived a few years ago. This I do not at all believe, though it has evidently been retouched in places
					by some modern hand: but, however, I am authorised by this report to ask, whether the two poems in question are certainly antique and
					genuine. I make this enquiry in quality of an antiquary, and am not otherwise concerned about it: for, if I were sure that any one now
					living in Scotland had written them to divert himself and laugh at the credulity of the world, I would undertake a journey into the
					Highlands only for the pleasure of seeing him.</p>
