         <div class="salute">Dear Mason </div>
      </div>
      <p>First &amp; foremost pray take notice of the Paper, on wch I am writing to you: it is
         the first, that ever was made of silk-rags, upon the encouragement given by your Society
         of Arts;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; (if this were all the fruits) I think you need not regret your two Guineas a-year.
         the colour &amp; texture you see; &amp; besides I am told, it will not burn (at least will
         not flame) like ordinary paper, so that it may be of great use for hanging rooms.
         it is uncommonly tough, &amp; tho' very thin, you observe, is not transparent.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> here is another sort of it intended for the uses of Drawing.</p>
      <p>You have lately had a visit,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> where you are, that I am sure bodes no good, especially just at the time that the
         D: of C:y,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Mr Blacowe<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> died. we attribute it to a <span style="font-style:italic">Miff</span> about the Garter,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; some other humps &amp; grumps,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that he has received. alas! I fear, it will never do. the Conde de Fuentes<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was much at a loss, &amp; had like to have made a quarrel of it, that he had no body
         but the D: of N:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to introduce him: but Miss Chudleigh<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has appeased him with a Ball.</p>
      <p>I have sent Mus√¶us<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to Mr Fraser,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> scratched here &amp; there; &amp; with it I desired him to inclose a bloody Satyr, written
         against no less Persons than you &amp; me by name.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I concluded at first it was Mr Pottinger,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> because he is your Friend &amp; my humble Servant; but then I thought he knew the World
         too well to call us the favorite Minions of Taste,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; of Fashion, especially as to Odes, for to them his abuse is confined. so it is
         not Secretary Pottinger, but Mr Coleman,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> nephew to my Lady Bath, Author of the Connoisseur, a Member of some of the Inns of
         Court, &amp; a particular Acquaintance of Mr Garrick. what have you done to him? for I
         never heard his name before. he makes very tolerable fun with me, where I understand
         him (wch is not every where) but seems more angry with you. least People should not
         understand the humour of the thing (wch indeed to do, they must have our Lyricisms
         at their finger's ends) he writes letters in Lloyd's Evening Post<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to tell them, who &amp; what it was, that he meant; &amp; says, that it is like to produce
         a <span style="font-style:italic">great combustion</span> in the Literary World: so if you have any mind to <span style="font-style:italic">combustle</span> about it, well &amp; good! for me I am neither so literary, nor so combustible.</p>
      <p>I am going into Oxfordshire for a fortnight to a place near Henley,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; then to Cambridge, if that Owl Phobus does not hinder me, who talks of going to
         fizzle<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there at the Commencement.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>What do you say to Ld Lyttelton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (your old Patron),<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Mrs Montagu,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with their second-hand Dialogues of the Dead?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; then there is your Friend, the little black Man.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he has wrote one supplemental Dialogue,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but I did not read it.</p>
      <p>Do tell me of your health, your doings, your designs, &amp; your golden dreams, and try
         to love me a little better in Yorkshire than you did in Middlesex, for I am ever </p>
