            <salute>Dear Sr</salute>
         </opener>
         <p> I see &amp; feel the very natural unwillingness you must have to apply to those Persons for any
					thing, that may imply a sort of obligation; &amp; I more strongly see &amp; feel the obligation I have to you for being so ready to
					conquer that reluctance on my account. I could not at this distance do otherwise than refer you to Mr M: (who, I hope, has seen you) for particulars, wch he is better inform'd of than I am. I have heard since, that Dr L: is alive, &amp; thought to be out of danger; but he is a very old Man, &amp; tho' I am glad to see we may
					probably spare you this trouble for the present, I can only look upon it as defer'd for a time. Mr Bn
					so little knew of my intention, that the good Man has wrote to acquaint me of Dr L:s illness, &amp; (if I will qualify myself by taking
						orders, &amp; I know not what) offers me his utmost endeavours to serve me in the same way, &amp;
					make me <hi rend="italic">his Master.</hi> you will know before now from Mn, whether the Man be dead,
					or dying, or alive &amp; well at last. my zeal (indeed gratitude) to Mr B: only could have forced me to put you upon a disagreeable
					task, &amp; I shall be glad to hear, there is no farther occasion for doing any thing. if you find there is not, you will be so good to
					mention nothing of what has past, for I am aware too, that my desire to serve him may chance to do hurt; yet was unwilling to omitt any
					thing, that might possibly do good.</p>
         <p>I put the thing in the strongest light to you (being obliged to be concise) &amp; I don't wonder it appear'd somewhat desperate to
					your foresight. but in reality Mr B: has a pretty-strong natural interest among his own society, &amp; might possibly be chose without
					any <hi rend="italic">brigue</hi> at all, &amp; spite of opposition. only I would wish to bring it to a certainty. no body calls him
						Jac:te; I only mean, in case of disputes he might be call'd that, or something as absurd, for want of
					other abuse.</p>
         <p>I will go to Town on Friday to see poor Mr Ch: &amp; at your return hope to thank you at Strawby for
					your kindness. if I made you no excuse before, it was because I thought you might have forgot the occasion of it.</p>
