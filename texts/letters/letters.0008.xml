            <p>How severe is forgetful old Age <lb/> To confine a poor Devil so? <lb/>

         </q>
         <p>Thou dear envious Imp, to set me a longing with accounts of Plays &amp; Opera's, &amp; Masquerades after hearing of which, I can no
					more think of Logick &amp; Stuff, than you could of Divinity at a Ball, or of Caudle &amp; Carraway-Comfits after having been stuffed
					at a Christening: heaven knows! we have nobody in our Colledge, that has seen London, but one; and he, I believe comes out of
						Vinegar-yard, &amp; looks like toasted Cheshire cheese, strewed with brown Sugar. I beg you, give me
					the minutest Circumstances of your Diversions &amp; your Indiversions; tho' if it is as great a trouble to you to write, as it is a
					pleasure to me to get 'em by heart, I fear I shan't hear from you once in a twelve-month, &amp; dear now, be very punctual &amp; very
					long: if I had the least particle of pleasure, you should know it; &amp; so you should if I had any thing troublesome; tho' in
					Cambridge there is nothing so troublesome, as that one has nothing to trouble one. every thing is so tediously regular, so samish, that
					I expire for want of a little variety. I am just as I was, &amp; so is every thing about me; I hope you'll forgive my formality, in
					being just the same </p>
