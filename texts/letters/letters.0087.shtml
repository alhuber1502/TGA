         <div class="dateline">Florence, Dec. 19, N. S. 1739. </div>
      </div>
      <p>We spent twelve days at Bologna,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> chiefly (as most travellers do) in seeing sights; for as we knew no mortal there,
         and as it is no easy matter to get admission into any Italian house, without very
         particular recommendations, we could see no company but in public places; and there
         are none in that city but the churches. We saw, therefore, churches, palaces, and
         pictures from morning to night; and the 15th of this month set out for Florence,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and began to cross the Apennine mountains; we travelled among and upon them all that
         day, and, as it was but indifferent weather, were commonly in the middle of thick
         clouds, that utterly deprived us of a sight of their beauties: For this vast chain
         of hills has its beauties, and all the vallies are cultivated; even the mountains
         themselves are many of them so within a little of their very tops. They are not so
         horrid as the Alps, though pretty near as high; and the whole road is admirably well
         kept, and paved throughout, which is a length of fourscore miles, and more: We left
         the Pope's dominions, and lay that night in those of the Grand Duke<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Fiorenzuola,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a paltry little town, at the foot of Mount Giogo, which is the highest of them all.
         Next morning we went up it; the post-house is upon its very top, and usually involved
         in clouds, or half-buried in the snow. Indeed there was none of the last at the time
         we were there, but it was still a dismal habitation. The descent is most excessively
         steep, and the turnings very short and frequent; however, we performed it without
         any danger, and in coming down could dimly discover Florence, and the beautiful plain
         about it, through the mists; but enough to convince us, it must be one of the noblest
         prospects upon earth in summer. That afternoon we got thither; and Mr. Mann,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the resident, had sent his servant to meet us at the gates, and conduct us to his
         house. He is the best and most obliging person in the world. The next night we were
         introduced at the Prince of Craon's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> assembly (he has the chief power here in the Grand Duke's absence). The Princess,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and he, were extremely civil to the name of Walpole, so we were asked to stay supper,
         which is as much as to say, you may come and sup here whenever you please; for after
         the first invitation this is always understood. We have also been at the Countess
         Suarez's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a favourite of the late Duke,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and one that gives the first movement to every thing gay that is going forward here.
         The news is every day expected from Vienna of the Great Duchess's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> delivery; if it be a boy, here will be all sorts of balls, masquerades, operas, and
         illuminations; if not, we must wait for the Carnival, when all those things come of
         course. In the mean time it is impossible to want entertainment; the famous gallery,
         alone, is an amusement for months; we commonly pass two or three hours every morning
         in it, and one has perfect leisure to consider all its beauties. You know it contains
         many hundred antique statues, such as the whole world cannot match, besides the vast
         collection of paintings, medals, and precious stones, such as no other prince was
         ever master of; in short, all that the rich and powerful house of Medicis has in so
         many years got together.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> And besides this city abounds with so many palaces and churches, that you can hardly
         place yourself any where without having some fine one in view, or at least some statue
         or fountain, magnificently adorned; these undoubtedly are far more numerous than Genoa
         can pretend to; yet, in its general appearance, I cannot think that Florence equals
         it in beauty. Mr. Walpole is just come from being presented to the Electress Palatine
         Dowager;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> she is a sister of the late Great Duke's; a stately old lady, that never goes out
         but to church, and then she has guards, and eight horses to her coach. She received
         him with much ceremony, standing under a huge black canopy, and, after a few minutes
         talking, she assured him of her good will, and dismissed him: She never sees any body
         but thus in form; and so she passes her life, poor woman! [...]</p>
