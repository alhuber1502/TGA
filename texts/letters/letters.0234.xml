				     <p>I write to the Vine imagining you may be still there to tell you, that I was to have gone to Strawberry on Monday last, but being ill
					was obliged to write the day before, &amp; excuse myself. Mr W: could not receive my letter till Monday afternoon, &amp; had therefore
					sent a Messenger from London early that morning to say, that he was very ill of a Fever &amp; Rash, &amp; unable to go himself to
					Twickenham. I know this is a dangerous season, &amp; that malignant Fevers are now very common, &amp; am therefore something alarmed at
					his situation. if you have heard anything, you will let me know; &amp; particularly, if any thing should carry you soon to Town. I
					myself have been ill, eversince I came out of Hampshire. I have had <hi rend="italic">advice,</hi> &amp; have been bloodied, &amp;
					taken draughts of salt of Wormwood, Lemons, Tincture of Guiacum, Magnesia, &amp; the Devil. you will
					immediately conclude, they thought me rheumatic &amp; feverish. no such thing! they thought me gouty, &amp; that I had no fever. all I
					can say is, that my heats in the morning are abated, that my foot begins to ach again, &amp; that my head achs, &amp; feels light &amp;
					giddy. so much for me. my Comp:ts to the Gentleman with the Moco -smelling-bottle, the
						Muntz's, the Betties, &amp; the Babies.</p>
