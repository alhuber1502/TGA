      <p>I agree with you that you have broke Statius's head, but it is in like manner as Apollo
         broke Hyacinth's, you have foiled him infinitely at his own weapon; I must insist
         on seeing the rest of your translation, and then I will examine it entire, and compare
         it with the latin, and be very wise and severe, and put on an inflexible face, such
         as becomes the character of a true son of Aristarchus, of hyper-critical memory. In
         the mean while,

         <p>And calm'd the terrors of his claws in gold,</p>

      <p>is exactly Statius–Summos auro mansueverat ungues. I never knew before that the golden
         fangs on hammer-cloths were so old a fashion. Your Hymenêal I was told was the best
         in the Cambridge Collection before I saw it, and indeed, it is no great compliment
         to tell you I thought it so when I had seen it, but sincerely it pleased me best.
         Methinks the college bards have run into a strange taste on this occasion. Such soft
         unmeaning stuff about Venus and Cupid, and Peleus and Thetis, and Zephyrs and Dryads,
         was never read. As for my poor little Eclogue, it has been condemned and beheaded
         by our Westminster judges; an exordium of about sixteen lines absolutely cut off,
         and its other limbs quartered in a most barbarous manner. I will send it you in my
         next as my true and lawful heir, in exclusion of the pretender, who has the impudence
         to appear under my name.

      <p>As yet I have not looked into Sir Isaac. Public disputations I hate; mathematics I
         reverence; history, morality, and natural philosophy have the greatest charms in my
         eye; but who can forget poetry? they call it idleness, but it is surely the most enchanting
         thing in the world, 'ac dulce otium &amp; pœne omni negotio pulchrius.'
