      </div>
      <p>My letter enjoys itself, before its open'd, in imagining the Confusion you'll be in,
         when you hear, that a Coach &amp; six is just stop'd at Christ-church Gates, &amp; desires
         to speak with you,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with a huddle of things in it, as different as ever met together in Noah's Ark; a
         fat one, and a lean one, and one, that can say a little with his mouth, &amp; a great
         deal with his pen; &amp; one that can neither speak, nor write; but you'll see 'em; joy
         be with you; I hope too, I shall shortly see you; at least in congratulatione Oxoniensi:
         my dear West, I more than ever regret you;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it would be the greatest of pleasures to me, to know wht you do, wht you read, how
         you spend your time, &amp;c: &amp;c: &amp; to tell you wht I do not do, not read, &amp; how I do not,
         &amp;c: &amp;c: for almost all the employment of my hours may be best explained by Negatives;
         take my word &amp; experience upon it, doing nothing is a most amusing business, &amp; yet
         neither Something, nor nothing give me any pleasure; for this little while last past,
         I have been playing with Statius; we yesterday had a game at Quoits together, you'll
         easily forgive me for having broke his head, as you have a little Pique to him</p>

         <p>Phlegyas the long-expected play began, <br /> Summon'd his strength, &amp; call'd forth all the Man; <br /> All eyes were bent on his experienced hand, <br /> For oft in Pisa's sports his native land <br /> Admired that arm, oft on Alpheus' Shore<br /> The pond'rous brass in exercise he bore; <br /> Where flow'd the widest Stream he took his stand; <br /> Sure flew the Disc from his unerring hand; <br /> Nor stop'd till it had cut the further strand: <br /> And now in Dust the polish'd Ball he roll'd, <br /> Then grasp'd its weight, elusive of his hold; <br /> Now fitting to his gripe, &amp; nervous Arm <br /> Suspends the crowd with expectation warm; <br /> Nor tempts he yet the plain, but hurl'd upright <br /> Emits the mass, a prelude of his might; <br /> Firmly he plants each knee, &amp; o'er his head, <br /> Collecting all his force, the circle sped; <br /> It towers to cut the clouds; now thro' the Skies <br /> Sings in its rapid way, &amp; strengthens, as it flies; <br /> Anon with slack'ned rage comes quivering down, <br /> Heavy &amp; huge, &amp; cleaves the solid ground.</p> 
         <p>So from th'astonish'd Stars, her nightly train, <br /> The Sun's pale sister, drawn by magic strain, <br /> Deserts precipitant [her]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> darken'd Sphere;<br /> In vain the Nations [wi]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>th officious fear<br /> Their cymbals toss, &amp; sounding brass explore; <br /> Th' Ã&#x86;monian Hag enjoys her dreadful hour, <br /> And smiles malignant on the labouring Power.</p>
