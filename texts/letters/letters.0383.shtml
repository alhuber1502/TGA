         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>I have been very naughty, I confess; but I informed your Brother a good while ago,
         that both your letters came safe to my hands. the first indeed wch went to Cambridge,
         had had its seal broken, wch naturally I should have attributed to the curiosity of
         somebody at Durham: but as Mr. Brown (who, you know, is care itself) sent it me without
         taking notice of any such thing, I rather believe it was mere accident, &amp; happen'd,
         after it had pass'd thro' his hands.
      </p>
      <p>I long to see you, but my visit must be defer'd to another year, for Mr. Jauncey having
         lost his Bishop, &amp; having settled his Son in a Curacy, means to let his house entire,
         &amp; in September I shall be forced to look out for another place, &amp; must have the plague
         of removing. the glass-manufacture in Worcester:re (I am told) has fail'd. Mr. Price
         here has left off business, &amp; retired into Wales: the Person, who succeeds him, does
         not pretend to be acquainted with all the secrets of his art. the Man at York is now
         in Town, exhibiting some specimens of his skill to the Society of Arts: him (you say)
         you have already consulted. coats of arms will doubtless be expensive (Price used
         to have five Guineas for a very plain one) figures much more so. unless therefore
         you can pick up some remnants of old painted glass, wch are sometimes met with in
         farm-houses, little out-of-the-way churches &amp; vestries, and even at country-glasiers
         shops, &amp;c: I should advice to buy plain colour'd glass (for wch they ask here in St
         Martin's Lane 5S: a pound, but it is sold at York for 2 or 3S:) &amp; make up the tops
         of your windows in a mosaïck of your own fancy. the glass will come to you in square
         plates, (some part of wch is always wrinkled &amp; full of little bubbles, so you must
         allow for waste), any glasier can cut it into <span style="font-style:italic">quarrels,</span> &amp; you can dispose the pattern &amp; colours, red, blew, purple, &amp; yellow (there is also
         green, if you like it) as well or better than the Artisan himself, &amp; certainly much
         cheaper. I would not border it with the same, least the room should be too dark. nor
         should the <span style="font-style:italic">quarrels</span> of clear glass be too small (in the lower part of the window); if they are but turn'd
         corner-ways, it is enough to give it a gothic aspect. if there is anything to see
         (tho' it be but a tree) I should put a very large diamond-pane in the midst of each
         division.
      </p>
      <p>I had rather Major G: throw'd away his money, than somebody else. it is not worth
         while even to succeed, unless <span style="font-style:italic">gratis;</span>  nor in any case to be attempted without the B:s absolute concurrence. I wish you
         joy of Dr Squire's Bishoprick: he keeps both his livings, &amp; is the happiest of Devils.
         Stonhewer, who is coming, will (if you see him) tell you more news vivâ voce, than
         I could write: I therefore do not tap that chapter.
