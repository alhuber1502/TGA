      <p>I am afraid something is the matter with you, that I hear nothing from you, since
         I pass'd two days with you <span style="font-style:italic">in your absence.</span>  I am not in Ireland, as you perhaps might imagine by this natural sentence: but
         shall be as glad to hear from you, as if I were.
      </p>
      <p>A week ago I saw something in the Newspaper sign'd <span style="font-style:italic">An Enemy to brick-walls in improper places.</span> while I was studying how (for brevity's sake) to translate this into Greek, Mr Brown
         did it in one word, <span style="font-style:italic">Μασονίδης</span>. I hope, it is not that complaint, hard (I must own) to digest, that sticks in your
         stomach, &amp; makes you thus silent.
      </p>
      <p>I am sorry to tell you, that I hear a very bad account of Dr Hurd: he was taken very
         ill at Thurcaston, &amp; obliged with difficulty to be carried in a chaise to Leicester.
         he remained there confined some time, before he could be convey'd on to London. as
         they do not mention, what his malady is, I am much afraid, it is a return of ye same
         disorder that he had last year in Town.
      </p>
      <p>I am going thither for a few days myself, &amp; shall soon be able to tell you more of
         him. 
      </p>
      <p>Wyatt is return'd hither very calm, but melancholy, &amp; looking dreadfully pale: he
         thinks of orders, I am told.
      </p>
