      <p>I plague you to death, but I must reply a few more words. I shall be very glad to
         see in print, and to have those that are worthy see your ancient odes; but I was in
         hopes there were some pieces too that I had not seen. I am sorry there are not. </p>
      <p>I troubled you about Perkin's proclamation, because Mr. Hume lays great stress upon
         it, and insists, that if Perkin affirmed his brother was killed, it must have been
         true, if he was true duke of York. Mr. Hume would have persuaded me that the proclamation
         is in Stowe, but I can find no such thing there; nor, what is more, in Casley's catalogue,
         which I have twice looked over carefully. I wrote to sir David Dalrymple<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in Scotland, to enquire after it, because I would produce it if I could, though it
         should make against me: but he, I believe, thinking I enquired with the contrary view,
         replied very drily, that it was published at York, and was not to be found in Scotland.
         Whether he is displeased that I have plucked a hair from the tresses of their great
         historian;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or whether, as I suspect, he is offended for king William;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> this reply was all the notice he took of my letter and book. I only smiled, as I
         must do when I find one party is angry with me on king William's, and the other on
         lord Clarendon's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> account.</p>
      <p>The answer advertised is Guthrie's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who is furious that I have taken no notice of <span style="font-style:italic">his</span> History. I shall take as little of his pamphlet; but his end will be answered, if
         he sells that and one or two copies of his History. Mr. Hume, I am told, has drawn
         up an answer too, which I shall see, and, if I can, will get him to publish;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for, if I should ever choose to say any thing more on this subject, I had rather
         reply to him than to hackney-writers: â&#x80;&#x93;to the latter, indeed, I never will reply.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> A few notes I have to add that will be very material; and I wish to get some account
         of a book that was once sold at Osborn's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that exists perhaps at Cambridge, and of which I found a memorandum t'other day in
         my note-book. It is called A paradox, or apology for Richard III. by sir William Cornwallis.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> If you could discover it, I should be much obliged to you.</p>
      <p>Lord Sandwich, with whom I have not exchanged a syllable since the general warrants,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> very obligingly sent me an account of the roll at Kimbolton;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and has since, at my desire, borrowed it for me and sent it to town.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> It is as long as my lord Lyttelton's History;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but by what I can read of it (for it is both ill-written and much decayed), it is
         not a roll of kings, but of all that have been possessed of, or been earls of Warwick:
         or have notâ&#x80;&#x93;for one of the first earls is Ã&#x86;neas. How, or wherefore, I do not know,
         but amongst the first is Richard III. in whose reign it was finished, and with whom
         it concludes. He is there again with his wife and son, and Edward IV. and Clarence<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and his wife, and Edward their son (who unluckily is a little old man), and Margaret
         countess of Salisbury, their daughterâ&#x80;&#x93;But why do I say with these? There is every
         body else tooâ&#x80;&#x93;and what is most meritorious, the habits of all the times are admirably
         well observed from the most savage ages. Each figure is tricked with a pen, well drawn,
         but neither coloured nor shaded. Richard is straight, but thinner than my print; his
         hair short, and exactly curled in the same manner; not so handsome as mine, but what
         one might really believe intended for the same countenance, as drawn by a different
         painter, especially when so small; for the figures in general are not so long as one's
         finger. His queen is ugly, and with just such a square forehead as in my print, but
         I cannot say like it. Nor, indeed, where forty-five figures out of fifty (I have not
         counted the number) must have been imaginary, can one lay great stress on the five.
         I shall, however, have these figures copied, especially as I know of no other image
         of the son. Mr. Astle<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is to come to me to-morrow morning to explain the writing.</p>
      <p>I wish you had told me in what age your Franciscan friars lived; and what the passage
         in Comines is.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I am very ready to make amende honorable.</p>
      <p>Thank you for the notes on the Noble Authors. They shall be inserted when I make a
         new edition, for the sake of the trouble the person has taken, though they are of
         little consequence. Dodsley has asked me for a new edition;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but I have had little heart to undertake such work, no more than to mend my old linen.
         It is pity one cannot be born an ancient, and have commentators to do such jobs for
         one!</p>

         <p>On reading over your letter again this morning, I do find the age in which the friars
            livedâ&#x80;&#x93;I read and write in such a hurry, that I think I neither know what I read
