         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>You will excuse me, if I write you a little news in this busy time, tho' I have nothing
         else to write. the Ladies are rejoiced to hear, they may probably have a marriage
         before the Coronation, wch will restore to that pomp all the beauties it would otherwise
         have lost. I hear (but this is <span style="font-style:italic">sub sigillo</span>) no very extraordinary account of the P:ss of Saxe-Gotha, either as to her person,
         or temper. I never saw a face of <span style="font-style:italic">less sorrow</span> than on the late <span style="font-style:italic">occasion.</span>  <span style="font-style:italic">I do not blame</span> the inhabitants of a certain great House for not putting on that appearance: it would
         look like affectation. but even the old Servants, &amp; Friends appear insensible, &amp; he
         is already, as if he never had been. one Person however has behaved with <span style="font-style:italic">firmness</span> &amp; yet great decency. he walks (at his own desire) Chief Mourner at the solemnity
         on Tuesday, &amp; supposing even the spectacle itself did not touch him, yet it must do
         so on reflection, that he may himself be probably the next that enters that gloomy
         place,  which is far from unlikely. M:n walks in the same procession, &amp; as you possibly
         may see him the next day, he will give you the best account of it. you have heard
         (I suppose) that there are two Wills (not duplicates). he had given to the D: all
         his jewels, but at the last going to H:r had taken with him all the best of them,
         &amp; made them Crown-Jewels, so that they come to the Successor. he had also given the
         D: three Millions of Rix-Dollars in money, but in the <span style="font-style:italic">last</span> will (made since the affair at <span style="font-style:italic">Closter-Seven</span>) after an apology to him, as the best Son, that ever lived, &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">one, that has never offended him,</span> declares, that the expences of the war have consumed all this money. he gives him
         (&amp; had before done so by a deed of gift) all his mortgages in Germany valued at 170,000£,
         but the French are in possession of part of these lands, &amp; the rest are devoured by
         the war. he gives to Pss Emily, &amp; Mary, about 37000£ between them, the Survivor to
         take the whole (I have heard, that the D: was to have a third of this, but has given
         up his share to his Sisters). to Lady Y: a Box, wch is said to have in it 10,000£
         in notes. the K: is residuary Legatee; what that amounts to, no one will know; &amp; consequently
         it must remain a doubt, whether he died rich or poor: I incline to believe rather
         the latter, I mean, in comparison of what was expected.
      </p>
      <p>The Archbishop is the most assiduous of Courtiers, standing for ever upright in the
         midst of a thousand Ladies. the other day he trod on the toes of the D:, who turned
         to him (for he made no sort of excuse) &amp; said aloud, If your G: is so eager to make
         your court, that is the way (pointing towards the King) &amp; then to the Count de Fuentes,
         You see, Priests are the same in this country as in yours.
      </p>
      <p>Mr E: Finch (your Representative) has got the place that Sr H: E: (my Friend) had,
         Surveyor (I think) of the Roads, wch is about 600£ a-year. what then (you will ask)
         is become of my Friend? oh, he is a vast Favourite, is restored to his Regiment, &amp;
         made Groom of the Bed-Chamber. I have not been to see him yet, &amp; am half-afraid, for
         I hear, he has <span style="font-style:italic">a Levee.</span> pray, don't tell.
      </p>
      <p>Ld J: C: is fix'd to come at his time in spite of the World. I hear within the year,
         you may expect a visit from his Majesty in person. the worst I can tell you is that
         Squit will be a B:p
      </p>
      <p>When the D: of Dev: introduced my Ld Mayor, he desired his Grace would be so kind
         to tell him, wch was my <span style="font-style:italic">Ld</span> <span style="font-style:italic">Boot</span>? this must not be told at all; nor any thing else <span style="font-style:italic">as from me.</span></p>
