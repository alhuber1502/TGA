				     <p>You are very perverse. I do desire, you would not think of dropping the design you had of obliging the A:p. I submitted my criticisms to your own conscience, &amp; I allow'd the latter half to be <hi rend="italic">excellent,</hi> two or three little words excepted. if this will not do, for the future I must say (whatever you send me) that the
					whole is the most perfect thing in nature, wch is easy to do, when one knows it will be acceptable. seriously I should be sorry, if you
					did not correct these lines; &amp; am interested enough for the <hi rend="italic">party</hi> (only upon your narrative) to wish, he
					were satisfied in it, for I am edified, when I hear of so <hi rend="italic">mundane</hi>
					 a Man, that yet–He has a tear for pity–</p>
				     <p>By the way I ventured to shew the <hi rend="italic">other</hi>
					 Epitaph to Dr Wh:, &amp; sent him brim-full into the next room to cry: I believe, he did not hear it
					quite through, nor has he ever ask'd to hear it again. and now will you not come &amp; see him?</p>
				     <p>We are just come back from a little journey to Barnard-Castle, Rookby, &amp; Richmond (Mr Brown &amp; all, all) some thoughts we have of
					going for two or three days to Hartlepool. then we (Dr W: &amp; I), talk of seeing Westm:d &amp; Cumberland, &amp; perhaps the west of
					Yorkshire; the mountains I mean, for we despise the plains. then at our return I write to you, not to shew my talent at description,
					but to ask again, whether you will come or no.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu! I wish you health &amp; peace of mind, and am ever <lb/> Yours </salute>

				     <postscript>
					       <p>Mr Brown &amp; the Dr desire their comp:ts to Mr Robinson.
