            <dateline>Saturday. July 21. 1759. </dateline>
            <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I have at last found rest for the sole of my gouty foot in your own old Dining-room, &amp; hope in spite of the damnation denounced by the Bishop's two Chaplains, that you may find at least an equal satisfaction &amp; repose at Old-Park. if your Bog prove as comfortable as my Oven, I shall see no occasion to pity you; &amp;
					only wish that you may <hi rend="italic">brew</hi> no worse, than I <hi rend="italic">bake.</hi> you totally mistake my talents, when
					you impute to me any magical skill in planting roses. I know, I am no Conjuror in these things; when
					they are done, I can find fault, &amp; that is all. now this is the very reverse of Genius, &amp; I feel my own littleness. reasonable
					People know themselves better, than is commonly imagined; &amp; therefore (tho' I never saw any instance of it) I believe Mason, when
					he tells me he understands planting better, than anything whatever. the <hi rend="italic">prophetic
						eye of Taste</hi> (as Mr. Pitt call'd it) sees all the beauties, that a Place is susceptible of,
					long before they are born; &amp; when it plants a seedling, already sits under the shadow of it, &amp; enjoys the effect it will have
					from every point of view, that lies in prospect. you must therefore invoke Caractacus, &amp; he will send his Spirits from the top of Snowdon to Cross-Fell, or Warden-Law.
				</p>
         <p>The Thermometer is in the Passage-Window (where the Sun never comes) near the head of the Back-Stairs. since you went, I have never
					observed it lower than 68, most part of the day at 74, &amp; yesterday at 5 in ye afternoon it was at 79, the highest I have ever seen
					it. it now is prepared to correspond regularly with you at the hours you mention. the Weather for this fortnight has been broiling
					without interruption, one thunder-shower excepted, wch did not cool the air at all. Rye (I am told) is begun to be cut near London. in
					Cambridgeshire a fortnight ago the promise of harvest was the finest I ever saw, but the Farmers complain (I hear) that the ears do not
					fill for want of wet: the Wheat was then turning yellow. Duke-Cherries are over in London; 3 days ago
					they sold for half-a-crown a Pound. Caroons &amp; Black-Hearts very large &amp; fine drive about the
					streets in wheel-barrows a penny a pound. Raspberries a few are yet remaining, but in a manner over. Melons are ripe, &amp; Apricots
					&amp; Orleans-Plums are to be seen in the fruitshops. Roses are (I think) over a week ago. the Jessamine (at Mrs Dod's on a S:W: Wall)
					was in full bloom (if you remember) long before you went from hence, &amp; so it continues. that below in the Garden on a N:E: Wall has
					been all this week cover'd with flowers. my nosegays from Covent-Garden consist of nothing but Scarlet-Martagons, Everlasting-Peas,
					Double-Stocks, Pinks, &amp; flowering Marjoram: as I have kept no exact account hitherto this year, I can say no more of July, that now
					is. therefore I shall annex one for the year 1754, wch I observed day by day at Stoke. observe, it had been then a cold rainy
						Summer.
				</p>
         <p>The heat was very moderate this month, &amp; a great deal of rain fell. the sown Hay was all got in by the first day, but the
					meadow-hay was not before ye 23d. it was very good &amp; in plenty, but sold at 40 shillings a load in the field on account of the
					scarcity the year preceding. Barley was in ear on the first day; grey and white Peas in bloom. the Bean flowers were going off.
					Duke-Cherries in plenty on the 5th; Hearts were also ripe. green Melons on the 6th, but watry, &amp; not sweet. Currants begun to ripen
					on the 8th, &amp; red Goose-berries had changed colour; Tares were then in flower, &amp; Meadow-Hay cutting. Lime-trees in full bloom
					on the 9th. Mushrooms in perfection on the 17th. Wheat &amp; Oats had changed colour, &amp; Buck-Wheat was in bloom on the 19th. the
					Vine had then open'd its blossoms, &amp; the end of ye month Grapes were near ye size of small Pease. Turneps appear'd above ground on
					the 22d; &amp; Potatoes were in flower. Barley had changed its hue, &amp; Rye was almost ripe on the 23d. The Pine-apple-Strawberry was
					then in perfection. Black Caroons were ripe, &amp; some Duke-Cherries still remain'd on walls the 26th, but the Hearts were then all
					spoil'd by the rain. Gooseberries red &amp; white were then ripe, &amp; Currants in abundance. </p>

         <p>I was too late for the Post on Saturday, so I continue on Monday. it is now 6 in the afternoon, &amp; the Therm: is mounted to 80,
					tho' the Wind is at N. East by N: .. the gay Lady Essex is dead of a Fever during her lieing-in;
					&amp; Mrs. Charles York last week, with one of her Children, of the Sore-throat. Heberden, &amp; (I think) Taylor, attended her: the latter had pronounced her out
					of danger; but Heb:n doubted about her. the little Boy was at Acton, &amp; escaped the infection.</p>
         <p>Every body continues as quiet about the Invasion, as if a Frenchman, as soon as he set his foot on our coast, would die, like a Toad
					in Ireland: yet the King's Tents &amp; Equipage are order'd to be ready at an hour's warning. no body knows positively, what is the
					damage, that Rodney has done, whether much or little: he can only guess himself; &amp; the French
					have kept their own secret, as yet. of the 12 Millions, raised for the year, eight are gone already, &amp; the old Party assure us,
					there is no more to be had for next year. you may easily guess at the source of my intelligence,
					&amp; therefore will not talk of it. News is hourly expected of a Battle in Westphalia, for Pr: Ferdinand was certainly preparing to
					fight the French, who have taken Minden by storm.
				</p>
         <p>I hear the D: of N: is much broke eversince his Sister Castle-comer died, not that he cared for
					her, or saw her above once a year; but she was the last of the brood, that was left; &amp; he now goes regularly to Church, wch he
					never did before.
