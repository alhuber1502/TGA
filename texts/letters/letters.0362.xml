         <p>I can not figure to myself what you should mean by <hi rend="italic">my old papers.</hi> I sent none. all I can make out is this.
					when I sent the Mus√¶us and the Satyr home to Mr Fraser, my Boy carried back the Conway-Papers to a house in your street. as I remember, they were divided into three
					parcels, on the least of wch I had wrote the word <hi rend="italic">Nothing</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Of no consequence.</hi> it did
					not consist of above 20 letters at most, &amp; if you find any thing about Mr Bourne's affairs, or
					Steward's &amp; Servants letters &amp; bills, it is certainly so. this was carried to Mr Fraser by mistake, &amp; sent to Aston; and if
					this is the case, they may as well be burnt. but if there is a good number, &amp; about affairs of state (wch you may smell out) then
					it is one of the other parcels, &amp; I am distress'd, &amp; must find some method of getting it up again. I think I had inscribed the
					two packets, that signified any thing, one <hi rend="italic">Papers of Q: Elizabeth, or earlier,</hi> the other (wch was a great
					bundle) <hi rend="italic">Papers of K: James &amp; Charles 1st.</hi> pray heaven, it is neither of these: therefore don't be
					precipitate in burning.</p>
         <p>I do not like your improvements at Aston, it looks so like <hi rend="italic">settling</hi>: if I
					come, I will set fire to it. your policy &amp; your gratitude I approve, &amp; your determination never to quarrel, &amp; ever to pray:
					but I, that believe it want of power, am certainly civiller to a certain Person, than you, that call
					it want of exertion. I will never believe the [ ] ns are dead, tho' I smelt them; that sort of People
					always [live] to a good old-age. I dare swear, they are only gone to Ireland, &amp; we shall soon
					hear they are Bishops.</p>
         <p>The bells are ringing, the Squibs bouncing. the Siege of Quebec is raised. Swanton got up the river, when they were bombarding the Town. Murray made a sally, routed them &amp; took all their
					baggage. this is sum &amp; substance in the vulgar tongue, for I cannot get the Gazette till midnight. perhaps you have had an
						Estafette. since I find, their cannon are all taken, &amp; that two days after a French Fleet going
					to their assistance was intercepted, &amp; sunk or burnt.</p>
         <p>Tomorrow I go into Oxfordshire, &amp; a fortnight hence, when old Fobus's Owls-nest is a little aired, I go into it.</p>
