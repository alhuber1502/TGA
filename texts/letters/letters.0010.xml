					Apology, since I have long learnt to be more than contented with whatever comes from a hand so dear. the things, that are to be

					hope you'll not fail to send your thoughts by the post, without a Masque. you are extremely good in making me a feast every other day;
					I have kept myself alive all this long Christmas by the help of your letters, &amp; a few Mince-pyes, which an old Gentlewoman in this town sends me, &amp; in whose favour I have made no small progress, I can assure you. you must know,

					[day she] was dying, as every one thought, but herself: and when the Physician told her how dangerous
					her case was; she fell into a violent passion with him: marry come up! she dye! no, indeed would'nt she; dye quotha! she'd as soon be
