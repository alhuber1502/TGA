         <p>A Note </p>
         <p>Having made many enquiries about the authenticity of these Fragments; I have got a letter from Mr
					David Hume (the Historian) wch is more satisfactory than any thing I have yet met with on that subject. he says,</p>
         <p>Certain it is, that these poems are in every body's mouth in the High-lands, have been handed down from Father to Son, &amp; are of
					an age beyond all memory &amp; tradition. Adam Smith, the celebrated Professor in Glasgow, told me,
					that the Piper of the Argyleshire Militia repeated to him all those, wch Mr Macpherson has translated, &amp; many more of equal beauty.
					Major Mackay (Ld Rae's Brother) told me, that he remembers them perfectly well; as likewise did the
					Laird of Macfarline (the greatest Antiquarian we have in this country) &amp; who insists strongly on
					the historical truth, as well as the poetical beauty of these productions. I could add the Laird &amp; Lady Macleod, with many more,
					that live in different parts of the highlands, very remote from each other, &amp; could only be acquainted with what had become (in a
					manner) national works. there is a Country-Surgeon in Lochaber, who has by heart the entire Epic Poem mention'd by Mr Macpherson in his
					Preface, &amp; as he is old; is perhaps the only person living, that knows it all; &amp; has never committed it to writing; we are in
					the more hast to recover a Monument, wch will certainly be regarded as a curiosity in the Republick of Letters: we have therefore set
					about a subscription of a Guinea or two Guineas apiece in order to enable Mr Macpherson to undertake a Mission into the Highlands to
					recover this poem, &amp; other fragments of antiquity.
				</p>
         <p>I forgot to mention to you that the names of Fingal, Oscian, Oscur, &amp;c: are still given in the Highlands to large Mastiffs, as we
					give to ours the names of CÃ¦sar, Pompey, Hector &amp;c: </p>
