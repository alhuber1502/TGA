      </div>
      <p>It was I, that desired Bob<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to let you know, how glad I should be to see you in Town. I now repeat the same thing
         to you myself, &amp; shall be obliged to your Mamma<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if she can spare you the beginning of next week, tho' but for a few days, the letter
         of Attorney, w<span class="super">ch</span> I send inclosed, is not meant to hinder your journey, but that in case your own inclination
         does not serve, or your Mamma is not able to spare you, Dolly<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> may be empower'd to act for you, for, as you have already 50 Â£ N:Annuities,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I thought you would like rather to buy in there (while they are so low) than into
         any other of the funds, the expence of this is a trifle, w<span class="super">ch</span> I shall be glad to pay myself, if you will come instead of it, &amp; make it useless.</p>
      <p>The Receipt is to be sign'd, &amp; witness'd; the two witnesses required to the letter
         of Attorney should specify their place of abode, you will enclose, &amp; send them both
         carefully to your Sister; but (as I said before) I should much rather see you in person.
         let us know by tomorrow nights post.</p>
