      </div>
      <p>It was I, that desired Bob to let you know, how glad I should be to see you in Town.
         I now repeat the same thing to you myself, &amp; shall be obliged to your Mamma if she
         can spare you the beginning of next week, tho' but for a few days, the letter of Attorney,
         w<span class="super">ch</span> I send inclosed, is not meant to hinder your journey, but that in case your own inclination
         does not serve, or your Mamma is not able to spare you, Dolly may be empower'd to
         act for you, for, as you have already 50 Â£ N:Annuities, I thought you would like rather
         to buy in there (while they are so low) than into any other of the funds, the expence
         of this is a trifle, w<span class="super">ch</span> I shall be glad to pay myself, if you will come instead of it, &amp; make it useless.
      </p>
      <p>The Receipt is to be sign'd, &amp; witness'd; the two witnesses required to the letter
         of Attorney should specify their place of abode, you will enclose, &amp; send them both
         carefully to your Sister; but (as I said before) I should much rather see you in person.
         let us know by tomorrow nights post.
      </p>
