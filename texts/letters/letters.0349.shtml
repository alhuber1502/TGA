         <div class="salute">Dear Doctr. </div>
      </div>
      <p>I can not say any thing to you about Mason, whose motions I am entirely a stranger
         to, &amp; have not once heard from him since he left London; till (the 3d of this month)
         a letter came, in wch he tells me, that Gaskarth<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is at Aston with him, &amp; that the latter end of the month, or beginning of the next,
         he shall be in Town as he goes into waiting the last fortnight in October. Ld H:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has sent him no less than four Expresses (literally so) with publick News good &amp;
         bad, wch has made him of infinite importance in the eyes of that neighbourhood. I
         can not pretend therefore to guess, whether he will be able to come to you. I am sorry
         to tell you that I try in vain to execute your commission about tapestry. what is
         so bad, as wry-mouthed histories? and yet for this they ask me at least double the
         price you talk of. I have seen nothing neither, that would please me at any price:
         yet I allow tapestry (if at all tolerable) to be a very proper furniture for your
         sort of house; but doubt, if any bargain of that kind is to be met with, except at
         some old mansion-sale in the country, where People will disdain tapestry, because
         they hear, that Paper<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is all the fashion. Stonhewer<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been in Northamptonshire till now: as you told me the subject of your letter,
         I did not send it thither to him, besides that he was every day expected in Town.
         at last he is come, &amp; has it; but I have not yet seen him: he is gone today (I believe)
         to Portsmouth to receive a Morocco Embassador, but returns very shortly. there is
         one advantage in getting into your Abbey at Christmas-time: that it will be at its
         worst, &amp; if you can bear it then, you need not fear for the rest of the year. Mr W:
         has lately made a new Bed-chamber,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch as it is in the best tast of any thing he has yet done, &amp; in your own Gothic
         way, I must describe a little. you enter by a peaked door at one corner of the room
         (out of a narrow winding passage, you may be sure) into an Alcove, in wch the bed
         is to stand, formed by a screen of pierced work opening by one large arch in the middle
         to the rest of the chamber, wch is lighted at the other end by a bow-window of three
         days,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whose tops are of rich painted glass in mosaïc.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the cieling is coved &amp; fretted in star &amp; quatrefoil compartments with roses at the
         intersections, all in papier-maché. the chimney on your left is the high-altar in
         the Cathedral of Rouen (from whence the Screen also is taken)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> consisting of a low surbased Arch between two octagon Towers, whose pinnacles almost
         reach the Cieling, all of Nich-work. the chairs &amp; dressing-table are real carved Ebony,
         pick'd up at auctions. the hangings uniform purple paper, hung all over with the Court
         of Henry, ye 8th, copied after the Holbein's in the Queen's Closet at Kensington,
         in black &amp; gold frames. the bed is to be either from Burleigh<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (for Ld Exeter<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is new-furnishing it, &amp; means to sell some of his original houshold-stuff) of the
         rich old tarnish'd embroidery; or if that is not to be had, &amp; it must be new, it is
         to be a cut velvet with a dark purple pattern on a stone-colour sattin-ground, &amp; deep
         mixt fringes, &amp; tassels.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there's for you, but I want you to see it. in the mean time I live in the Musæum,
         &amp; write volumes of antiquity. I have got (out of the original Ledger-book of the Signet)
         K: Richard 3d's Oath to Elizabeth, <span style="font-style:italic">late calling herself Queen of</span> England; to prevail upon her to come out of Sanctuary with her 5 Daughters.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> his Grant to Lady Hastings &amp; her Son, dated 6 weeks after he had cut off her Husband's
         head.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a Letter to his Mother;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> another to his Chancellor,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to persuade his Sollicitor General<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> not to marry Jane Shore then in Ludgate by his command. Sr Tho: Wyat's Defence at
         his Tryal, when accused by Bp Bonner of high-treason;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Lady Purbeck &amp; her Son's remarkable Case,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; several more odd things unknown to our Historians. when I come home, I have a great
         heap of ye Conway-papers<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (wch is a secret) to read, &amp; make out. in short I am up to the ears.</p>
      <p>The Fish you mention is so accurately described that I know it at sight. it is the
         <span style="font-style:italic">Ink-fish,</span> or Loligo of the Romans. in Greek <span style="font-style:italic">Τευθὸς</span>, in Italian, Calamaio. in French, Calmar. you will find it ranged by Linnæus in the
         Class of <span style="font-style:italic">Vermes,</span> the Order of <span style="font-style:italic">Mollusca,</span> the Genus of <span style="font-style:italic">Sepia,</span> No 4. pag: 659. the smaller ones are eaten as a delicacy fried, with their own ink
         for sauce, by the Italians &amp; others. you may see it in Aldrovandus.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I do not see much myself of the face of nature here, but I enquire. Wheat was cutting
         in Kent the 23d of July. the 25th at Enfield. the 27th Wheat, Barley, &amp; Oats cutting
         all at once about Windsor: the forward Pease all got in, ground plough'd and turneps
         sow'd. 9th of August Harvest still continued in Buck:re. the 27th about Kennington
         it was just over, being delay'd for want of hands. in some places 50 mile from London
         it is but just over now for the same reason. the 3d of Aug: Catherine-pears, Muscle-Plums,
         &amp; small black Cherries were sold in wheelbarrows. Filberds in plenty the 8th. Mulberries,
         &amp; fine green-gage plums, the 19th. fine Nectarines &amp; Peaches, the 27th. the 4th of
         Sept:r Melons &amp; Perdrigon-plums. the 8th, Walnuts 20 a penny. this is all I know about
         fruit. my Weather is not very compleat. </p>
