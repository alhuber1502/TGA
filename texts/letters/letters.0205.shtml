      <p>My dear Wharton I judge by this time you are in town. the reason that I thought would
         have deprived me of the pleasure of seeing you is now at an end. my poor Mother, after
         a long &amp; painful Struggle for life, expired on Sunday morning.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when I have seen her buried, I shall come to London, &amp; it will be a particular satisfaction
         to me to find you there. if you can procure me a tolerable lodging near you, be so
         good (if you can conveniently) to let me know the night you receive this; if not,
         I shall go to my old Landlord in Jermyn Street.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I believe, I shall come on Tuesday,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; stay a few days, for I must return hither to pay my Aunt<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> her Arrears, wch she will demand with great Exactness.</p>
