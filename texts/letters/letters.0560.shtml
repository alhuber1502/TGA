         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I have been so unfortunate as to lose the pleasure of seeing your two Friends Dr Gerard<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Mr Duncan. when they pass'd thro' this place, I was at London; &amp; tho' Ld Strathmore
         told me, there was a Gentleman, who had letters for me, he coud not tell me where
         he was lodged. after my return hither,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when they (I suppose) were leaving London, I received your letter by the post.</p>
      <p>The late ceremony of the D: of Grafton's Installation<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has hinder'd me from acknowledging sooner the satisfaction your friendly compliment
         gave me. I thought myself bound in gratitude to his Grace unasked to take upon me
         the task of writing those verses, that are usually set to musick on this occasion.
         I do not think them worth sending you, because they are by nature doom'd to live but
         a single day, or if their existence is prolong'd beyond that date, it is only by means
         of news-paper parodies,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; witless criticism.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> this sort of abuse I had reason to expect, but did not think it worth while to avoid
         it.</p>
      <p>Mr Foulis is magnificent in his gratitude:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I can not figure to myself, how it can be worth his while to offer me such a present.
         you can judge better of this than I, &amp; if he does not hurt himself by it, I would
         accept the <span style="font-style:italic">Homer</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with many thanks. I have not got, nor even seen it.</p>
      <p>I could wish to subscribe to his new edition of Milton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; desire to be set down for two copies of ye large paper: but you must inform me
         where &amp; when I may pay the money.</p>
      <p>You have taught me to long for a second letter, &amp; particularly for what you say will
         make the contents of it:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have nothing to requite it with, but plain &amp; friendly truth, &amp; that you shall have,
         join'd to a zeal for your fame, &amp; a pleasure in your success.</p>
      <p>I am now setting forward on a journey towards the North of England, but it will not
         reach so far as I should wish, as I must return hither before Michaelmas, &amp; shall
         barely have time to visit a few places &amp; a few Friends. </p>
