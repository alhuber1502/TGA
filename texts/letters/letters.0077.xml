				     <p>We have made three short days journey of it from Rheims hither, where we arrived the night before
					last: The road we have passed through has been extremely agreeable; it runs through the most fertile part of Champaigne by the side of
					the river Marne, with a chain of hills on each hand at some distance, entirely covered with woods and vineyards, and every now and then
					the ruins of some old castle on their tops; we lay at St. Dizier the first night, and at Langres the second, and got hither the next
					evening time enough to have a full view of this city in entering it: It lies in a very extensive plain covered with vines and corn, and
					consequently is plentifully supplied with both. I need not tell you that it is the chief city of Burgundy, nor that it is of great
					antiquity; considering which one should imagine it ought to be larger than one finds it. However, what it wants in extent, is made up
					in beauty and cleanliness, and in rich convents and churches, most of which we have seen. The palace of the States is a magnificent new
					building, where the Duke of Bourbon is lodged when he comes every three years to hold that Assembly, as governour of the Province. A
					quarter of a mile out of the town is a famous Abbey of Carthusians, which we are just returned from seeing. In their chapel are the
					tombs of the ancient Dukes of Burgundy, that were so powerful, till at the death of Charles the Bold, the last of them, this part of
					his dominions was united by Lewis XI. to the crown of France. To-morrow we are to pay a visit to the Abbot of the Cistercians, who
					lives a few leagues off, and who uses to receive all strangers with great civility; his Abbey is one of the richest in the kingdom; he
					keeps open house always, and lives with great magnificence. We have seen enough of this town already to make us regret the time we
					spent at Rheims; it is full of people of condition, who seem to form a much more agreeable society than we found in Champaigne; but as
					we shall stay here but two or three days longer, it is not worth while to be introduced into their houses. On Monday or Tuesday we are
					to set out for Lyons, which is two days journey distant, and from thence you shall hear again from
					me.</p>
