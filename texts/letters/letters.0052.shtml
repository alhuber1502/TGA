      <p>I ought to answer you in Latin, but I feel I dare not enter the lists with you – cupidum,
         pater optime, vires deficiunt. Seriously you write in that language with a grace and
         an Augustan urbanity that amazes me: Your Greek too is perfect in its kind. And here
         let me wonder that a man, longè græcorum doctissimus, should be at a loss for the
         verse and chapter whence my epigram is taken. I am sorry I have not my Aldus with
         me that I might satisfy your curiosity; but he with all my other literary folks are
         left at Oxford, and therefore you must still rest in suspense. I thank you again and
         again for your medical prescription. I know very well that those 'risus, festivitates,
         &amp; facetiæ' would contribute greatly to my cure, but then you must be my apothecary
         as well as physician, and make up the dose as well as direct it; send me, therefore,
         an electuary of these drugs, made up secundùm artem, 'et eris mihi magnus Apollo',
         in both his capacities as a god of poets and god of physicians. Wish me joy of leaving
         my college, and leave yours as fast as you can. I shall be settled at the Temple very
         soon.
