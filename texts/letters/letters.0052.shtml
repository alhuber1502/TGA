   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>I ought to answer you in Latin,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but I feel I dare not enter the lists with you – cupidum, pater optime, vires deficiunt.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Seriously you write in that language with a grace and an Augustan urbanity that amazes
         me: Your Greek too is perfect in its kind. And here let me wonder that a man, longè
         græcorum doctissimus, should be at a loss for the verse and chapter whence my epigram
         is taken. I am sorry I have not my Aldus with me that I might satisfy your curiosity;
         but he with all my other literary folks are left at Oxford, and therefore you must
         still rest in suspense. I thank you again and again for your medical prescription.
         I know very well that those 'risus, festivitates, &amp; facetiæ' would contribute greatly
         to my cure, but then you must be my apothecary as well as physician, and make up the
         dose as well as direct it; send me, therefore, an electuary of these drugs, made up
         secundùm artem, 'et eris mihi magnus Apollo',<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in both his capacities as a god of poets and god of physicians. Wish me joy of leaving
         my college, and leave yours as fast as you can. I shall be settled at the Temple very
         soon.</p>
