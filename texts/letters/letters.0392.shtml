      <p>Every language has its idiom, not only of words and phrases, but of customs and manners,
         which cannot be represented in the tongue of another nation, especially of a nation
         so distant in time and place, without constraint and difficulty; of this sort, in
         the present instance, are the curfew bell, the Gothic Church, with its monuments,
         organs and anthems, the texts of Scripture, &amp;c. There are certain images, which, though
         drawn from common nature, and every where obvious, yet strike us as foreign to the
         turn and genius of Latin verse; the beetle that flies in the evening, to a Roman,
         I guess, would have appeared too mean an object for poetry; 'that leaves the world
         to darkness and to me', is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and
         therefore, I believe, you were in the right to drop it.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>

      <p>Might not the English characters here be romanized? Virgil is just as good as Milton,
         and CÃ¦sar as Cromwell, but who shall be Hampden?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
