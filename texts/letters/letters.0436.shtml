      <p>I thank you for remembring me, &amp; am impatient for the books: the nearest place you
         can send them to is the Queen's Head Inn in Grays-Inn Lane, from whence the Cambridge
         Fly sets out, &amp; brings parcels (I believe) daily.

         yet I have some gleams of hope, for it is in the power of one Man to prevent it, if
         he will stand the brunt; andâ€”

      <p>Do, oblige me with a change in the Ministry: I mean, something one may tell, that
         looks as if it were near at hand; or if there is no truth to be had, then a good likely
