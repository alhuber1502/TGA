      <p>Dr Swift says, one never should write to one's Friends but in high health &amp; spirits.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> by the way it is the last thing people in those circumstances usually think of doing:
         but it is sure, if I were to wait for them, I never should write at all. at present
         I have had for these six weeks a something growing in my throat, wch nothing does
         any service to, &amp; wch will, I suppose, in due time stop up the passage. I go however
         about, &amp; the pain is very little. you will say perhaps, the malady is as little, &amp;
         the stoppage is in the imagination. no matter for that! if it is not sufficient to
         prove want of health (for indeed this is all I ail) it is so much the stronger proof
         of the want of spirits. so take it as you please, I carry my point, &amp; shew you, that
         it is very obliging in me to write at all. indeed perhaps on your account, I should
         not have done it: but after three such weeks of Lapland-weather I can not but enquire
         after Mrs Mason's health. if she has withstood such a winter &amp; her cough never the
         worse: she may defy the Doctors &amp; all their works. pray, tell me how she is, for I
         interest myself for her not merely on your account, but on her own. these three last
         mornings have been very vernal &amp; mild: has she tasted the air of the new year at least
         in Hyde-Park?</p>
      <p>Mr Brown will wait on her next week, &amp; touch her.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he has been confined to lie on a couch, &amp; under the Surgeon's hands eversince the
         first of January with a broken shin ill-doctor'd. he is just now got abroad, &amp; obliged
         to come to Town about Monday on <span style="font-style:italic">particular</span> business.</p>
      <p>Stonhewer was so kind as to tell me the mystery now accomplish'd, before I received
         your letter. I rejoice in all his accessions:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I wish, you would persuade him to take unto him a Wife: but don't let her be a fine
         Lady. Adieu. present my respects &amp; good wishes to Argentile.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
