      <p>Mine, you are to know, is a white Melancholy, or rather Leucocholy for the most part;
         which though it seldom laughs or dances, nor ever amounts to what one calls Joy or
         Pleasure, yet is a good easy sort of a state, and Ã§a ne laisse que de s'amuser. The
         only fault of it is insipidity; which is apt now and then to give a sort of Ennui,
         which makes one form certain little wishes that signify nothing. But there is another
         sort, black indeed, which I have now and then felt, that has somewhat in it like Tertullian's
         rule of faith, Credo quia impossibile est; for it believes, nay, is sure of every
         thing that is unlikely, so it be but frightful; and, on the other hand, excludes and
         shuts its eyes to the most possible hopes, and every thing that is pleasurable; from
         this the Lord deliver us! for none but he and sunshiny weather can do it. In hopes
         of enjoying this kind of weather, I am going into the country<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for a few weeks, but shall be never the nearer any society; so, if you have any charity,
         you will continue to write. My life is like Harry the fourth's supper of Hens. 'Poulets
         a la broche, Poulets en RagÃ´ut, Poulets en HÃ¢chis, Poulets en FricasÃ©es.'<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Reading here, Reading there; nothing but books with different sauces. Do not let
         me lose my desert then; for though that be Reading too, yet it has a very different
         flavour. The May seems to be come since your invitation; and I propose to bask in
         her beams and dress me in her roses.</p>

      <p>I send you an inscription for a wood joining to a park of mine; (it is on the confines
         of Mount CithÃ¦ron, on the left hand as you go to Thebes) you know I am no friend
         to hunters, and hate to be disturbed by their noise.</p>

      <p>Here follows also the beginning of an Heroic Epistle; but you must give me leave to
         tell my own story first, because Historians differ. Massinissa was the son of Gala
         King of the Massyli; and, when very young at the head of his father's army, gave a
         most signal overthrow to Syphax, King of the MasÃ¦sylians, then an ally of the Romans.
         Soon after Asdrubal, son of Gisgo the Carthaginian General, gave the beautiful Sophonisba,
         his daughter, in marriage to the young prince. But this marriage was not consummated
         on account of Massinissa's being obliged to hasten into Spain, there to command his
         father's troops, who were auxiliaries of the Carthaginians. Their affairs at this
         time began to be in a bad condition; and they thought it might be greatly for their
         interest, if they could bring over Syphax to themselves. This in time they actually
         effected; and to strengthen their new alliance, commanded Asdrubal to give his daughter
         to Syphax. (It is probable their ingratitude to Massinissa arose from the great change
         of affairs, which had happened among the Massylians during his absence; for his father
         and uncle were dead, and a distant relation of the royal family had usurped the throne.)
         Sophonisba was accordingly married to Syphax: and Massinissa, enraged at the affront,
         became a friend to the Romans. They drove the Carthaginians before them out of Spain,
         and carried the war into Africa, defeated Syphax, and took him prisoner; upon which
         Cirtha (his capital) opened her gates to LÃ¦lius and Massinissa. The rest of the affair,
         the marriage, and the sending of poison, every body knows.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> This is partly taken from Livy,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and partly from Appian.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
