      <p>Mine, you are to know, is a white Melancholy, or rather Leucocholy for the most part;
         which though it seldom laughs or dances, nor ever amounts to what one calls Joy or
         Pleasure, yet is a good easy sort of a state, and ça ne laisse que de s'amuser. The
         only fault of it is insipidity; which is apt now and then to give a sort of Ennui,
         which makes one form certain little wishes that signify nothing. But there is another
         sort, black indeed, which I have now and then felt, that has somewhat in it like Tertullian's
         rule of faith, Credo quia impossibile est; for it believes, nay, is sure of every
         thing that is unlikely, so it be but frightful; and, on the other hand, excludes and
         shuts its eyes to the most possible hopes, and every thing that is pleasurable; from
         this the Lord deliver us! for none but he and sunshiny weather can do it. In hopes
         of enjoying this kind of weather, I am going into the country for a few weeks, but
         shall be never the nearer any society; so, if you have any charity, you will continue
         to write. My life is like Harry the fourth's supper of Hens. 'Poulets a la broche,
         Poulets en Ragôut, Poulets en Hâchis, Poulets en Fricasées.' Reading here, Reading
         there; nothing but books with different sauces. Do not let me lose my desert then;
         for though that be Reading too, yet it has a very different flavour. The May seems
         to be come since your invitation; and I propose to bask in her beams and dress me
         in her roses.

      <p>I shall see Mr. [...] and his Wife, nay, and his Child too, for he has got a Boy.
         Is it not odd to consider one's Cotemporaries in the grave light of Husband and Father?
         There is my Lords [...] and [...], they are Statesmen: Do not you remember them dirty
         boys playing at cricket? As for me, I am never a bit the older, nor the bigger, nor
         the wiser than I was then: No, not for having been beyond sea. Pray how are you?

      <p>I send you an inscription for a wood joining to a park of mine; (it is on the confines
         of Mount Cithæron, on the left hand as you go to Thebes) you know I am no friend to
         hunters, and hate to be disturbed by their noise.

      <p>Here follows also the beginning of an Heroic Epistle; but you must give me leave to
         tell my own story first, because Historians differ. Massinissa was the son of Gala
         King of the Massyli; and, when very young at the head of his father's army, gave a
         most signal overthrow to Syphax, King of the Masæsylians, then an ally of the Romans.
         Soon after Asdrubal, son of Gisgo the Carthaginian General, gave the beautiful Sophonisba,
         his daughter, in marriage to the young prince. But this marriage was not consummated
         on account of Massinissa's being obliged to hasten into Spain, there to command his
         father's troops, who were auxiliaries of the Carthaginians. Their affairs at this
         time began to be in a bad condition; and they thought it might be greatly for their
         interest, if they could bring over Syphax to themselves. This in time they actually
         effected; and to strengthen their new alliance, commanded Asdrubal to give his daughter
         to Syphax. (It is probable their ingratitude to Massinissa arose from the great change
         of affairs, which had happened among the Massylians during his absence; for his father
         and uncle were dead, and a distant relation of the royal family had usurped the throne.)
         Sophonisba was accordingly married to Syphax: and Massinissa, enraged at the affront,
         became a friend to the Romans. They drove the Carthaginians before them out of Spain,
         and carried the war into Africa, defeated Syphax, and took him prisoner; upon which
         Cirtha (his capital) opened her gates to Lælius and Massinissa. The rest of the affair,
         the marriage, and the sending of poison, every body knows. This is partly taken from
         Livy, and partly from Appian.
