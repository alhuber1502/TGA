					       <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I received the little letter, &amp; the inclosed, wch was a summons from the Insurance-Office. on
					Tuesday last came a dispatch from Lisbon. it is probable you have had one from my Lord, but least you
					should not, I will tell you the chief contents of mine. Mr Pitt says, they were both dreadfully sick all the time they were beating
					about the Channel, but when they came to Plymouth (I find) my Lord was so well however, that he open'd a Ball in the Dock-yard with the
					Master-Attendant's Daughter. they set sail from thence on the 28th, &amp; cross'd the Bay with a very
					smooth Sea, came in sight of C. Finisterre in 3 days time, &amp; before night saw the rugged Mountains of Galicia with great delight,
					&amp; came near the coast of Portugal opposite to Oporto. but (the wind changing in the night) they drove off to the West, and were in
					a way to visit the Brasils. however on the 7th of this month they enter'd the Tagus. he describes the Rock of Lisbon, as a most
					romantic &amp; beautiful scene; &amp; all the North-bank of the river up to the City has (he says) every charm but verdure. the City
					itself too in that view is very noble, &amp; shews but little of the Earthquake. that is all as
						yet. my Ld is to write next packet.</p>
				     <p>Ld G: S: proceeds in his defence. People wonder at, (&amp; some there are that celebrate) his
					dexterity, his easy elocution, &amp; unembarass'd manner. he told Gen: Cholmondeley, one of his
					Judges, who was asking a Witness some Question, that it was such a question as no Gentleman, or Man of honour, would put, &amp; it was
					one of his misfortunes to have him among his Judges. upon wch some Persons behind him gave a loud clap. but I do not find the Court
					either committed or reprimanded them. Ld Albemarle only contented himself with saying, he was sure,
					that those Men could be neither Gentlemen, nor Men of honour. in the midst of this I do not hear any one point made out in his favour;
					&amp; Col: Sloper, whose evidence bore the hardest upon him, &amp; whom he had reflected upon with
					great warmth, &amp; very opprobrious terms, has offer'd the Court (if they had any doubt of his veracity) to produce 16 more Witnesses,
					who will say the same thing. to be sure nothing in the Field of Minden could be half as dreadful, as this daily baiting he now is
					exposed to; so (supposing him a Coward) he has chose very ill.
				</p>
				     <p>I am not very sorry, your Venetians have abandon'd you: no more (I believe) are you. Mason is very
					well, sitting (as usual) for his picture, &amp; while that is doing, will not think of Yorkshire. we
					heard Delaval the other night play upon the water-glasses, &amp; I
					was astonish'd. no instrument, that I know, has so celestial a tone. I thought it was a Cherubim in a box.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu, Dear Sr, remember me to such as remember me; particularly (whether she does or not) to Mrs Bonfoy.</salute>
				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p>I suppose, you know, Dr Ross has got the Living of Frome from Ld Weymouth.</p>
