         <div class="salute">My dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>Having been some little time absent from hence<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I missed of your letter, or I had answer'd it as soon as you desire me. the opportunity
         of a good House<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I hope you will not suffer to escape you. whether the rent be too high, you alone
         can properly judge. there is great comfort to be sure in a good house. some appearance
         of Œconomy I should think would give you credit in that part of the town you are to
         be well with: they pride themselves in living much within their income. upon the whole
         I seem to have a partiality for Mr Crumpe, but be sure never to repent. if you think,
         you shall, by all means settle yourself in the great house. besides I do not know
         but some great old Doctor may come &amp; squat himself down there at your elbow (for I
         suppose there may be some convenience in succeeding to a house of the same Profession)
         &amp; then you would be horridly out of humour. in short you see with your own eyes, you
         know the Quarter, &amp; must necessarily be best qualified to decide. Dr Fothergill's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> invitation is very civil. as to the depth of Science, wch you seem to dread, it always
         grows shallower, as one comes nearer, tho' it makes a great noise at a distance. the
         design of the Society<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at least is a good one. but if they are warm &amp; profess'd Enemies of the College,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I should think the same reason, that makes Heb:n<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> withdraw himself, should prevent your admission into it: it will be easy to delay
         it however on various pretences without disobliging any one.</p>
      <p>I am glad you agree with me in admiring Mr Southcote's Paradise,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch whenever you see it again, will improve upon you. do you know, you may have it
         for 20,000£. but I am afraid, the Lands are not very improveable. you do not say enough
         of Esher.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is my other favourite place. it was a Villa of Cardinal Wolsey's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of wch nothing but a part of the Gateway<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> remain'd. Mr Kent<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> supplied the rest, but I think with you, that he had not read the Gothic Classicks
         with taste or attention.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he introduced a mix'd Style, wch now goes by the name of the <span style="font-style:italic">Battey Langley</span> Manner.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he is an Architect, that has publish'd a book of bad Designs. if you have seen Mr
         W:s<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> pray let me hear your opinion, wch I will not anticipate by saying any-thing about
         it. to be sure its extreme littleness will be the first thing, that strikes you. by
         all means see Ld Radnor's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> again. he is a simple old Phobus,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but nothing can spoil so glorious a situation, wch surpasses every thing round it.
         I take it ill, you should say any thing against ye Mole.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is a reflection, I see, cast at the Thames. do you think, that Rivers, wch have
         lived in London &amp; its neighbourhood all their days, will run roaring &amp; tumbling about,
         like your Tramontane Torrents in the North. no, they only glide &amp; whisper. in your
         next expedition you will see Claremont,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Ld Portmore's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch joins my Ld Lincoln's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; above all Mr Hamilton's, at Cobham<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in Surrey, wch all the world talks of &amp; I have seen seven years ago.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Year indeed does not behave itself well. but think, what it must be in the North.
         I suppose the roads are impassable with the deep snow still.</p>
      <p>I could write abundance more, but am afraid of losing this Post. pray, let me hear
         from you as soon as you can, &amp; make my Compliments to Mrs Wharton. Mason is by this
         time in Town again. [Tuthill ]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Brown, I believe, at Cambridge.</p>
