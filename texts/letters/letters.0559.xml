         <p>All, alas! is over, and I have been compelled by cruel necessity to figure to myself all the splendours and glories; how the Ode was
					sung, and played, and applauded (all but) as it deserves (the first glimpse I shall see of it will be I suppose in the critical
						review ). How thoroughly sensible of the honour the duke was. How he was pressed to death by people
					who never saw a duke before; and thought themselves in heaven if a chance word dropped on them in the crowd. How Dr. Gordon clapped with both his hands, and grinned with all his teeth when his Grace but looked as if he would speak,
					and bowed lower than even clergymen are used to bow. I should have been glad to have heard the Ode, and very glad to have seen you; but
					I suspect that I shall like it as well without Dr. Randal's music. And as for you, you would have been so beset with ministers of state
					that I should have seen nothing of you; so I thought it best to remain in quiet here, rather than to put myself to a great deal of
					inconvenience, expense, and trouble, to get into the midst of a bustle which I hate, and be disappointed at last. </p>
         <p>We shall depart, I suppose, the middle of this month, so, if after that time you direct to me at Augustus Floyer's, Esq. at Upwey, near Dorchester, Dorsetshire, I shall be very glad to hear news from Yorkshire, or
					Cumberland, or Westmoreland, or no news at all provided I hear.</p>
         <p>Many thanks for the Wilton book!

         <p>I have read the first volume of Robertson. It may be all vastly right, but it certainly is a little
					tiresome to have five hundred pages of disquisitions on feudal tenures, &amp;c. such a pile of gothic learning in your way, when you
					are all impatience to begin an interesting history; and surely, it is not good policy in the author to tire you to death in order to
					interest you the more. All that I know is, that it is not at all like MÃ©moires de Sully. But then Robertson is a grave historian, and
					the other only a writer of memoirs. Why then a writer of memoirs is a better thing than an historian.</p>
         <p>And so my mother waits to carry my letter to the post, and desires her compliments. </p>
         <p>I am at the moment <hi rend="italic">inebriated</hi> with gales of mignonette of my own sowing. 'Oh the pleasures of the plain',
					&amp;c. For God's sake leave Pembroke (at least when there are leaves on the trees) and get a house in Wales, and let me come and pass
					a summer with you. Adieu! do not despise me when you come among the mountains.</p>
