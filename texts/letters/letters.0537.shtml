         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>I have been remiss in answering your last letter, wch was sent me to Ramsgate from
         Cambridge: for I have pass'd a good part of the summer in different parts of Kent
         much to my satisfaction. could I have advised any thing essential in poor Mrs Ett:s
         case, I had certainly replied immediately: but we seem of one mind in it. there was
         nothing left but to appeal to Delegates (let the trouble &amp; expence be what they will
         almost) &amp; to punish, if it be practicable, that old Villain, who upon the bench of
         justice dared to set at nought all common sense &amp; all humanity.
      </p>
      <p>I write to you now chiefly to tell you (and I think you will be pleased, (nay, I expect
         the whole family will be pleased with it,) that on Sunday se'nnight, Brockett died
         by a fall from his horse, being (as I hear) drunk, &amp; some say, returning from Hinchinbroke:
         that on the Wednesday following, I received a letter from the D: of Grafton, saying,
         He had the K:s commands to <span style="font-style:italic">offer</span> me the vacant Professorship, that &amp;c: (but I shall not write all he says) &amp; he adds
         at the end, <span style="font-style:italic">that from private as well as publick considerations He must take the warmest part
            in approving so well judged a measure as he hopes I do not doubt of the real regard
            &amp; esteem with wch he has the honor to be,</span> &amp;c: there's for you. so on Thursday the K: sign'd the warrant, &amp; next day at his
         Levee I kiss'd his hand. he made me several gracious speeches, wch I shall not report,
         because every body, who goes to court, does so. by the way I desire, you would say,
         that all the Cabinet-Council in words of great favour approved the nomination of your
         humble Serv:t &amp; this I am bid to say, &amp; was told to leave my name at their several
         doors. I have told you the outside of the matter &amp; all the manner: for the inside
         you know enough easily to guess t, &amp; you will guess right. as to his Grace I have
         not seen him before or since.
      </p>
      <p>I shall continue here perhaps a fortnight longer, perishing with heat: I have no Thermometer
         with me, but I feel it as I did at Naples. next summer (if it be as much in my power,
         as it is in my wishes) I meet you at the foot of Skiddaw. my respects to Mrs Wharton,
         &amp; the young Ladies great &amp; small: love to Robin &amp; Richard.
      </p>

         <div class="salute">Adieu! I am truly <br /> Yours.

      <div class="postscript">
         <p>At your instance I have kiss'd Mrs Forster, &amp; forgot old quarrels. I went to visit
            the Daughter, who has been brought to bed of a Boy, &amp; there I met with the Mother.
