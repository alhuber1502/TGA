         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am almost sorry to have raised any degree of impatience in you,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> because I can by no means satisfy it. the sole reason I have to publish these few
         additions<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> now is to make up (in bulk) for the omission of that <span style="font-style:italic">long story</span>; &amp; as to the notes, I do it out of spite, because the Publick did not understand
         the two odes (wch I have call'd Pindaric) tho' the first was not very dark, &amp; the
         second alluded to a few common facts to be found in any six-penny History of England
         by way of question &amp; answer for the use of children. the parallel passages I insert
         out of justice to those writers, from whom I happen'd to take the hint of any line,
         as far as I can recollect.</p>
      <p>I rejoice to be in the hands of Mr Foulis, who has the laudable ambition of surpassing
         his Predecessors, the <span style="font-style:italic">Etiennes,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the <span style="font-style:italic">Elzeviers</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as well in literature, as in the proper art of his profession. he surprises me in
         mentioning Miss Hepburne,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> after whom I have been enquiring these fourteen years in vain. when the two odes
         were first publish'd, I sent them to her: but as I was forced to direct them very
         much at random, probably they never came to her hands. when the present edition comes
         out, I beg of Mr Foulis to offer her a copy in my name (with my respects, &amp; grateful
         remembrances). he will send another to you, Sr, &amp; a third to Ld Gray,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if he will do me the honour of accepting it. these are all the presents I pretend
         to make (for I would have it consider'd only as a new edition of an old book) after
         this if he pleases to send me one or two, I shall think myself obliged to him. I can
         not advise him to print a great number, especially as Dodsley has it in his power
         to print as many as he pleases, tho' I desire him not to do so.</p>
      <p>You are very good to me in taking this trouble upon you. all I can say is, that I
         shall be happy to return it in kind, whenever you will give me the opportunity. believe
         me, </p>

         <p>You will be so obliging to tell me this packet<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is come to your hands.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
         <p>The Title (I would wish) should be only <span style="font-style:italic">Poems by Mr Gray</span> without any mention of notes or additions. the size, &amp; disposition of the lines I
            must leave to Mr Foulis: if he thinks it should be in 4to,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the two Odes printed at Str:y Hill are very well (as you say) as to the form &amp; type,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but the paper is rather too thin &amp; transparent. I prescribed nothing to Dodsley,
            but it appear'd to me, that he meant to publish a smaller edition (&amp; consequently
            a cheaper)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> than in 4to, but of this I am not certain. Mr F: will also determine, whether the
            few notes there are shall stand at the bottom of the page (wch is better for the Reader)
            or be thrown to the end with references (wch improves the beauty of the book).<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the poems should stand (I think) in this order &amp; with these titles. </p>
         <ul>
            <li class="item">1. Ode. Lo! where the rosy &amp;c: </li>
            <li class="item">2. Ode, on the death of a favourite Cat. </li>
            <li class="item">3. Ode, on a distant prospect of Eton-College. </li>
            <li class="item">4. Ode, to Adversity.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></li>
            <li class="item">5. The progress of Poesy, a Pindaric Ode. </li>
            <li class="item">6. The Bard, a Pindaric Ode. </li>
            <li class="item">7. The Fatal Sisters (from the Norse-tongue) </li>
            <li class="item">8. The Descent of Odin (from the Norse-tongue) </li>
            <li class="item">9. The Triumphs of Owen, a fragment (from the Welch) </li>
            <li class="item">10. Elegy, written in a country church-yard. </li>
         </ul>
         <p> please to observe, that I am entirely unversed in the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">stops</span>, whoever therefore shall deign to correct them, will do me a friendly office:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I wish I stood in need of no other correction. if Mr F: has the large edition with
            Mr Bentley's designs, he will do well to print from it (the <span style="font-style:italic">long story</span> being omitted) as it seems the most accurate for in Dodsley's miscellanies there
            are several blunders of the press.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Strawberry-hill edition of the two Pindaricks is also the best. /now for the
            notes.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
