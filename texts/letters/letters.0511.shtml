      </div>
      <p>I am come, &amp; shall rejoice to congratulate you face to face on your good luck, wch
         is wonderful in my eyes: I hope there are no rubs in the way to prevent my seeing
         you snug in the rectory, surrounded with fat pigs &amp; stubble-geese, &amp; Madam in her
         grogram gown doing the honours of Lovingland at the head of your table.
      </p>
      <p>I have much to say, so much that I shall say no more: but come quickly, if the main
         chance will suffer you, or I will know the reason why.
      </p>
