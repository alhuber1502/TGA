					       <dateline>29 July, 1768. </dateline>
					       <salute>Dear Mary, </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I thank you for all your intelligence (and the first news I had of poor Brocket's death was from
					you) and to reward you in part for it, I now shall tell you, that this day, hot as it is, I kissed the King's hand; that my warrant was
					signed by him last night; that on Wednesday I received a very honourable letter from the D. of Grafton, acquainting me that his majesty had ordered him to offer me this Professorship, and much more, which does me too much credit by
					half for me to mention it. The Duke adds, <hi rend="italic">that from private as well as public considerations, he takes the warmest
						part in approving this measure of the King's.</hi> These are his own words. You see there are princes (or ministers) left in the
					world, that know how to do things handsomely; for I profess I never asked for it, nor have I seen his Grace before or after this
					event.</p>
				     <p>Dr. R. (not forgetting a certain lady of his) is so good to you, and to me, that you may (if you
					please) show him my letter. He will not be critical as to the style, and I wish you would send it also to Mr. Brown, for I have not
					time to write to him by this day's post; they need not mention this circumstance to others, they may learn it as they can. Adieu!</p>
				     <p>I receive your letter of July 28 (while I am writing), consult your friends over the way, they are as good as I, and better. All I
					can say is, the Board have been so often used to the name of Antrobus lately, that I fear they may
					take your petition not in good part. If you are sure of the kindness or interest of Mr. A. the
					opportunity should not be lost; but I always a little distrust new friends and new lawyers.</p>
				     <p>I have found a man, who has brought Mr. Eyres (I think) up to my price, in a hurry; however he
					defers his final answer till Wednesday next. He shall not have it a shilling lower, I promise; and if he hesitates, I will rise upon
					him like a fury. Good-night. I am ever yours.</p>
				     <p>How could you dream that St: or Hinchl: would ask this for themselves? The only people that ask'd it
					were Lort, Marriott, Delaval,
						Jebb, and Peckâ€“, at least I have heard of no more. Delaval
					always communicated his thoughts to me, knowing I would make no ill use of that knowledge. Lort is a worthy man, and I wish he could
					have it, or something as good: the rest are nothing. </p>
