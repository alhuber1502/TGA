				     </opener>
				     <p>I have been for these three weeks &amp; more confined to my room by a fit of the gout, &amp; am now only beginning to walk alone
					again. I should not mention the thing, but that I am well-persuaded, it will soon be your own case, as you have so soon laid aside your
					horse, &amp; talk so relishingly of your old Port. </p>
				     <p>I can not see any objection to your design for Mr P:, as to Wilson we know him much alike. he seems a good honest Lad, &amp; (I believe) is scholar enough for your purpose. perhaps this connection may make (or marr) his fortune. our friend Foljambe has resided in college &amp; persevered in the ways of godliness till about ten days ago, when he disappear'd, &amp; no one knows,
					whether he is gone a hunting or a fornicating. the little Fitz-herbert is come a Pensioner to St
					John's, &amp; seems to have all his wits about him. your El√©ve Ld Richard Cav:sh having digested all
					the learning and all the beef this place could afford him in a two month's residence is about to
					leave us, &amp; his little Brother George succeeds him. Bp Keene has brought a Son from Eton to Peterhouse, &amp; Dr Heberden another to St John's, who is enter'd Pensioner, &amp; destined to the Church. this is all my University-news, but
					why do I tell you? come yourself &amp; see, for I hope you remember your promise at Aston, &amp; will make us in your way, as you go to
					your town-residence.</p>
				     <p>You have seen Stonh:r (I imagine) who went northwards on Saturday last. pray tell me how he is, for I think him not quite well. tell
					me this &amp; tell me when I may expect to see you here.</p>
