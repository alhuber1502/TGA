					       <salute>Dear Sir, </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I am much mortified that you give me so little hopes of your company on my journey, but I do not quite despair of that point. I am
					infinitely more concerned to find you dejected as you appear to be; I read your first letter with
					concern, and your last with greater. For God's sake how can you neglect a duty which never existed but in your own imagination, which catches every alarm too quickly? it never yet was
					performed, nor I believe expected. I hope your want of health is not so great as you think it. Is it the gout, a return of any former
					complaint, or what? But you need not answer my question, I am coming to town to be satisfied. I design to be there Wednesday sennight,
					and you will do me a favour to bespeak for me the story above you at Frisby's or some other lodging
					near you for a week. I have done my best for poor Temple. I am now half distracted with trying to
					rescue myself from the oppression of a merciless lawyer that is treating with me on Miss Allin's part about a lease of this house and
						estate; I have my faithful Mr. Spurgeon to counsel me, but all I
					believe will not do.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu! yours most faithfully.</salute>
