         <p>The figure of <span style="font-style:italic">Ulz-water</span> nothing resembles that laid down in our maps: it is 9 miles long, &amp; (at widest) under
            a mile in breadth. after extending itself 3 m: &amp; Â½ in a line to S: W: it turns at
            the foot of <span style="font-style:italic">Place-Fell,</span> almost due West, and is here not twice the breadth of the Thames at London. it is
            soon again interrupted by the roots of <span style="font-style:italic">Helvellyn,</span> a lofty &amp; very rugged mountain, &amp; spreading again turns off to S: E:, &amp; is lost among
            the deep recesses of the hills. to this second turning I pursued my way about four
            miles along its borders beyond a village scatter'd among trees &amp; call'd <span style="font-style:italic">Water-malloch,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in a pleasant grave day, perfectly calm &amp; warm, but without a gleam of sunshine:
            then the sky seeming to thicken, the valley to grow more desolate, &amp; evening drawing
            on, I return'd by the way I came to <span style="font-style:italic">Penrith.</span></p>
         <p>Oct: 2. Wd at S: E:, sky clearing, <span style="font-style:italic">Cross-fell</span> misty, but the outline of the other hills very distinct. set out at 10 for <span style="font-style:italic">Keswick,</span> by the road we went in 1767.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> saw <span style="font-style:italic">Greystock</span>-town &amp; castle to the right, wch lie only 3 miles (over the Fells) from <span style="font-style:italic">Ulz-water.</span> pass'd through <span style="font-style:italic">Penradock</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">Threlcot</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at the feet of <span style="font-style:italic">Saddleback,</span> whose furrow'd sides were gilt by the noon-day Sun, while its brow appear'd of a
            sad purple from the shadow of the clouds, as they sail'd slowly by it. the broad &amp;
            green valley of <span style="font-style:italic">Gardies</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Low-side,</span> with a swift stream glittering among the cottages &amp; meadows lay to the left; &amp; the
            much finer (but narrower) valley of St <span style="font-style:italic">John's</span> opening into it: <span style="font-style:italic">Hill-top</span> the large, tho' low, mansion of the Gaskarths,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> now a Farm-house, seated on an eminence among woods under a steep fell, was what
            appear'd the most conspicuous, &amp; beside it a great rock like some antient tower nodding
            to its fall.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> pass'd by the side of <span style="font-style:italic">Skiddaw</span> &amp; its cub call'd <span style="font-style:italic">Latter-rig,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; saw from an eminence at two miles distance the Vale of Elysium in all its verdure,
            the sun then playing on the bosom of the lake, &amp; lighting up all the mountains with
            its lustre.</p>
         <p>Dined by two o'clock at the Queen's Head, &amp; then straggled out alone to the <span style="font-style:italic">Parsonage,</span> fell down on my back across a dirty lane with my glass open in one hand, but broke
            only my knuckles: stay'd nevertheless, &amp; saw the sun set in all its glory.</p>
         <p>Oct: 3. Wd at S: E:, a heavenly day. rose at seven, &amp; walk'd out under the conduct
            of my Landlord<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to <span style="font-style:italic">Borrodale.</span> the grass was cover'd with a hoar-frost, wch soon melted, &amp; exhaled in a thin blewish
            smoke. cross'd the meadows obliquely, catching a diversity of views among the hills
            over the lake &amp; islands, &amp; changing prospect at every ten paces, left <span style="font-style:italic">Cockshut</span> &amp; Castle-hill (wch we formerly mounted) behind me, &amp; drew near the foot of <span style="font-style:italic">Walla-crag,</span> whose bare &amp; rocky brow, cut perpendicularly down above 400 feet, as I guess, awefully
            overlooks the way: our path here tends to the left, &amp; the ground gently rising, &amp;
            cover'd with a glade of scattering trees &amp; bushes on the very margin of the water,
            opens both ways the most delicious view, that my eyes ever beheld. behind you are
            the magnificent heights of <span style="font-style:italic">Walla</span>-crag; opposite lie the thick hanging woods of Ld Egremont,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">Newland</span>-valley with green &amp; smiling fields embosom'd in the dark cliffs; to the left the
            jaws of <span style="font-style:italic">Borodale,</span> with that turbulent Chaos of mountain behind mountain roll'd in confusion; beneath
            you, &amp; stretching far away to the right, the shining purity of the <span style="font-style:italic">Lake,</span> just ruffled by the breeze enough to shew it is alive, reflecting rocks, woods, fields,
            &amp; inverted tops of mountains, with the white buildings of <span style="font-style:italic">Keswick, Crosthwait</span>-church, &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">Skiddaw</span> for a back-ground at distance. oh Doctor! I never wish'd more for you; &amp; pray think,
            how the glass played its part in such a spot, wch is called <span style="font-style:italic">Carf-close-reeds</span>: I chuse to set down these barbarous names, that any body may enquire on the place,
            &amp; easily find the particular station, that I mean. this scene continues to <span style="font-style:italic">Barrow-gate,</span> &amp; a little farther, passing a brook called <span style="font-style:italic">Barrow-beck,</span> we enter'd <span style="font-style:italic">Borodale.</span> the crags, named <span style="font-style:italic">Lodoor-banks</span> now begin to impend terribly over your way; &amp; more terribly, when you hear, that
            three years since an immense mass of rock tumbled at once from the brow, &amp; bar'd all
            access to the dale (for this is the only road) till they could work their way thro'
            it. luckily no one was passing at the time of this fall; but down the side of the
            mountain &amp; far into the lake lie dispersed the huge fragments of this ruin in all
            shapes &amp; in all directions. something farther we turn'd aside into a coppice, ascending
            a little in front of <span style="font-style:italic">Lodoor</span> water-fall. the height appears to be about 200 feet, the quantity of water not great,
            tho' (these three days excepted) it had rain'd daily in the hills for near two months
            before: but then the stream was nobly broken, leaping from rock to rock, &amp; foaming
            with fury. on one side a towering crag, that spired up to equal, if not overtop, the
            neighbouring cliffs (this lay all in shade &amp; darkness) on the other hand a rounder
            broader projecting hill shag'd<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with wood &amp; illumined by the sun, wch glanced sideways on the upper part of the cataract.
            the force of the water wearing a deep channel in the ground hurries away to join the
            lake. we descended again, &amp; passed the stream over a rude bridge. soon after we came
            under <span style="font-style:italic">Gowder-crag,</span> a hill more formidable to the eye &amp; to the apprehension than that of <span style="font-style:italic">Lodoor</span>; the rocks atop, deep-cloven perpendicularly by the rains, hanging loose &amp; nodding
            forwards, seem just starting from their base in shivers: the whole way down &amp; the
            road on both sides is strew'd with piles of the fragments strangely thrown across
            each other &amp; of a dreadful bulk. the place reminds one of those passes in the Alps,
            where the Guides tell you to move on with speed, &amp; say nothing, lest the agitation
            of the air should loosen the snows above, &amp; bring down a mass, that would overwhelm
            a caravan. I took their counsel here and hasten'd on in silence.</p>
