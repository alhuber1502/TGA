      </div>
      <p>I write to the Vine imagining you may be still there to tell you, that I was to have
         gone to Strawberry on Monday last, but being ill was obliged to write the day before,
         &amp; excuse myself. Mr W: could not receive my letter till Monday afternoon, &amp; had therefore
         sent a Messenger from London early that morning to say, that he was very ill of a
         Fever &amp; Rash, &amp; unable to go himself to Twickenham. I know this is a dangerous season,
         &amp; that malignant Fevers are now very common, &amp; am therefore something alarmed at his
         situation. if you have heard anything, you will let me know; &amp; particularly, if any
         thing should carry you soon to Town. I myself have been ill, eversince I came out
         of Hampshire. I have had <span style="font-style:italic">advice,</span> &amp; have been bloodied, &amp; taken draughts of salt of Wormwood, Lemons, Tincture of Guiacum,
         Magnesia, &amp; the Devil. you will immediately conclude, they thought me rheumatic &amp;
         feverish. no such thing! they thought me gouty, &amp; that I had no fever. all I can say
         is, that my heats in the morning are abated, that my foot begins to ach again, &amp; that
         my head achs, &amp; feels light &amp; giddy. so much for me. my Comp:ts to the Gentleman with
         the Moco -smelling-bottle, the Muntz's, the Betties, &amp; the Babies.
