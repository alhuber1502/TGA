         <p>It was I, that desired Bob to let you know, how glad I should be to see you in Town. I now repeat
					the same thing to you myself, &amp; shall be obliged to your Mamma if she can spare you the beginning
					of next week, tho' but for a few days, the letter of Attorney, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> I send inclosed, is not meant to hinder your
					journey, but that in case your own inclination does not serve, or your Mamma is not able to spare you, Dolly may be empower'd to act for you, for, as you have already 50 Â£ N:Annuities, I thought you would like rather to buy in there (while they are so low) than into any other of the funds,
					the expence of this is a trifle, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> I shall be glad to pay myself, if you will come instead of it, &amp; make it
					useless.</p>
         <p>The Receipt is to be sign'd, &amp; witness'd; the two witnesses required to the letter of Attorney should specify their place of
					abode, you will enclose, &amp; send them both carefully to your Sister; but (as I said before) I should much rather see you in person.
					let us know by tomorrow nights post.</p>
