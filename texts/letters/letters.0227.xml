            <dateline>March, 9. 1755. Cambge: </dateline>
            <salute>My dear Doctor</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>According to my reckoning Mrs Wh: should have been brought to bed before this time; yet you say not a syllable of it. if you are so
					loth to publish <hi rend="italic">your productions,</hi> you can not wonder at the repugnance I feel to spreading abroad mine. but in
					truth I am not so much against publishing, as against publishing <hi rend="italic">this</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">alone.</hi> I have two or three Ideas more in my head. what is to come of them?
					must they too come out in the shape of little six-penny flams, dropping one after another, till Mr
					Dodsley thinks fit to collect them with Mr this's Song, and Mr t'other's epigram, into a pretty Volume? I am sure Mason must be
					sensible of this, &amp; therefore can never mean what he says. to be sure, Doctor, it must be own'd, that Physick, &amp; indeed all
					Professions, have a bad effect upon the Mind. this it is my Duty, &amp; Interest to maintain; but I shall still be very ready to write
					a Satyr upon the Clergy, &amp; an Epode against Historiographers, whenever you are hard press'd;
					&amp; (if you flatter me) may throw in a few lines with somewhat handsome upon Magnesia alba, &amp; Alicant-Soap. as to Humanity you
					know my aversion to it; wch is barbarous &amp; inhuman, but I can not help it. God forgive me.</p>
         <p>I am not quite of your opinion with regard to Strophe &amp; Antistrophe. setting aside the
					difficulties, methinks it has little or no effect upon the ear, wch scarce perceives the regular return of Metres at so great a
					distance from one another. to make it succeed, I am persuaded the Stanza's must not consist of above 9 lines each at the most. Pindar
					has several such Odes.</p>
         <p>Ld S: is come, &amp; makes a tall genteel figure in our eyes. his Tutors &amp; He appear to like one another mighty well. when we know more of him than his outside, You &amp; the
						Historian shall hear of it. I am going to ask a favour of you, wch I have no better pretence for
					doing, than that I have long been used to give you trouble. it is, that you would go to the London Insurance Office in
						Birchin-Lane for me, &amp; pay two Insurances, one of my House at Wansted (Policy, No 9675.) the other of that in Cornhill (No 23470.) from
					Lady-Day next to Lady-Day, 1756. the first is 20 Shillings; the 2d, 12 Shillgs: &amp; be pleased to inclose the two Receipts (stamp'd)
					in a Cover, and send them to me; the sooner the better, for I am always in a little apprehension during this season of
						Conflagrations. I know you will excuse me, &amp; therefore will make no excuses. I can not think of
					coming to town, till sometime in April myself.
				</p>
         <p>I know, you have wrote a very obliging Letter [to Tuthill] but as I have not seen it, &amp; he is
					not in my way at present, I leave him to answer for himself.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu, Dear Sr, &amp; make my Compliments to your Family, I am ever<lb/> Yours </salute>
