            <salute>Dear Mason</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I should be glad to know, at what time you think of returning into the North, because I am obliged to be in town the end of this
					month, or the beginning of the next, &amp; hope somewhere or other to coincide with you, if the <hi rend="italic">waters</hi> are not
					too much out. I shall trouble you, in case you have any call into the City (or if not, your Servant may do it) to pay the insurance of
					a house for me at the London-Assurance Office in Birchin-Lane. you will shew them the receipt, wch I
					here inclose, pay twelve shillings, &amp; take another such receipt stamp'd, which must be to <hi rend="italic">25 March, 1764.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>You may remember, that I subscribed long since to Stuart's book of Attica; so long since, that I
					have either lost or mislaid his receipt (wch I find is the case of many more people) now he doubtless has a list of names, &amp; knows
					this to be true. if therefore he be an honest Man, he will take two guineas of you, &amp; let me have my copy (and you will chuse a
					good impression) if not, so much the worse for him. by way of <hi rend="italic">douceur</hi> you may, if you please (provided the
					subscription is still open at its first price) take another for Pembroke-Hall, &amp; send them down together: but not unless he will
					let me have mine; &amp; so the worshipful Society authorise me to say. all these disbursements the College &amp; I will repay you with
					many thanks. </p>
         <p>Where is your just volume, &amp; when will you have done correcting it? remember me to Stonhewer,
					&amp; Dr Gisburne, &amp; believe me ever</p>
