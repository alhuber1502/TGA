         <p>We were all here in mighty consternation this morning in imagination that the Queen was dead, not out of a joke, as she died you know
					a while ago, but seriously gone to the Stygian ferry; however now they say she is only very
						bad, &amp; in a fair way; as we have been twice bauk'd, she will
					have much ado to persuade us, that she's dead in earnest &amp; perhaps she will survive her funeral no small time in the breasts of her
					good subjects: I shall take care to be as sorry, as one of my diminutiveness ought to be, not for myself, but in charity to my
					superiours; I saw her a little while ago at the Opera in a green Velvet Sac embroider'd <hi rend="italic">ÎºÎ±Ï&#x84;á½°</hi> the facings &amp;
					sleeves with Silver, a little French Cap, a long black hood, &amp; her hair in Curls round her face; but you see, Crown'd heads, &amp;
					heads MoutonnÃ©es, scald heads, &amp; lousy heads, Quack heads &amp; Cane heads must all come together to the Grave, as the famous Abou-saÃ¯d has elegantly hinted, in his Persian Madrigals: for
					my part I shall wear her image long imprinted in my mind, tho' I hope for all this to refresh it frequently, &amp; retouch it from the
					living Original: I don't know whether I should not debase the dignity of my Subject [after this by]
					telling you anything of Sigr Cafarelli, so leaving him, as all the World has done, to screech by
					himself; we shall descend more gradually, &amp; talk of West, who is just gone to Oxford again: as soon as Ashton told me he was in
					town, I went to Mr Periam's in Hatton-Garden; but Mr Periam had left his house (&amp; consequently Mrs West, as a Lodger) &amp; was
					removed to Thavies Inn; at Thavies Inn instead of Mr Periam, I could find nothing but a Note in the key-hole, directing me to Mr
					Greenaways; but Mr Greenaways key-hole sent me to Mr Herriot; &amp; there I found one of the blood of the Periams, who was so good as
					to inform me, he knew nothing of the matter; ibi omnis effusus labor: but in a few days more he came
					to me himself; then I went to supper with him, where he entertain'd me with all the product of his brain, Verses upon Stow,
					Translations of Catullus, &amp; Homer, Epick Epigrams, &amp; Odes upon the New-Year, Wild Ducks, &amp; Petits PÃ¢tÃ©s: we are to write to
					each other every post, if not oftener: he corresponds with Tozhy Cole, &amp; Quid Prinsep: the
					transactions of Mr Fleetwood &amp; Rich I defer to my next, or to
					word of mouth, for I shall be at Cambridge on Tuesday night, tho' I fear my not meeting with you
					there;</p>
