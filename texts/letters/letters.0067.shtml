      <p>Enfin donc me voici à Paris. Mr. Walpole is gone out to supper at Lord Conway's, and
         here I remain alone, though invited too. Do not think I make a merit of writing to
         you preferably to a good supper; for these [eight] days we have been here, have actually
         given me an aversion to eating in general. If hunger be the best sauce to meat, the
         French are certainly the worst cooks in the world; for what tables we have seen have
         been so delicately served, and so profusely, that, after rising from one of them,
         one imagines it impossible ever to eat again. And now, if I tell you all I have in
         my head, you will believe me mad, mais n'importe, courage, allons! for if I wait till
         my head grow clear and settle a little, you may stay long enough for a letter. Six
         days have we been coming hither, which other people do in two; they have not been
         disagreeable ones; through a fine, open country, admirable roads, and in an easy conveyance;
         the inns not absolutely intolerable, and images quite unusual presenting themselves
         on all hands. At Amiens we saw the fine cathedral, and eat paté de perdrix; passed
         through the park of Chantilly by the Duke of Bourbon's palace, which we only beheld
         as we passed; broke down at Lusarche; stopt at St. Denis, saw all the beautiful monuments
         of the Kings of France, and the vast treasures of the abbey, rubies, and emeralds
         as big as small eggs, crucifixes, and vows, crowns and reliquaries, of inestimable
         value; but of all their curiosities the thing the most to our tastes, and which they
         indeed do the justice to esteem the glory of their collection, was a vase of an entire
         onyx, measuring at least five inches over, three deep, and of great thickness. It
         is at least two thousand years old, the beauty of the stone and sculpture upon it
         (representing the mysteries of Bacchus) beyond expression admirable; we have dreamed
         of it ever since. The jolly old Benedictine, that showed us the treasures, had in
         his youth been ten years a soldier; he laughed at all the reliques, was very full
         of stories, and mighty obliging. On Saturday evening we got to Paris, and were driving
         through the streets a long while before we knew where we were. The minute we came,
         voila Milors Holdernesse, Conway, and his brother; all stayed supper, and till two
         o'clock in the morning, for here nobody ever sleeps; it is not the way: Next day go
         to dine at my Lord Holdernesse's, there was the Abbé Prevôt, author of the Cleveland,
         and several other pieces much esteemed: The rest were English. At night we went to
         the Pandore; a spectácle literally, for it is nothing but a beautiful piece of machinery
         of three scenes. The first represents the chaos, and by degrees the separation of
         the elements. The second, the temple of Jupiter, and the giving of the box to Pandora.
         The third, the opening of the box, and all the mischiefs that ensued. An absurd design,
         but executed in the highest perfection, and that in one of the finest theatres in
         the world; it is the grande sale des machines in the Palais des Tuileries. Next day
         dined at Lord Waldegrave's; then to the opera.

      <p>Imagine to yourself for the drama four acts entirely unconnected with each other,
         each founded on some little history, skilfully taken out of an ancient author, e.g.
         Ovid's Metamorphoses, &amp;c., and with great address converted into a French piece of
         gallantry. For instance, that which I saw, called the Ballet de la Paix, had its first
         act built upon the story of Nereus. Homer having said he was the handsomest man of
         his time, the poet, imagining such a one could not want a mistress, has given him
         one. These two come in and sing sentiment in lamentable strains, neither air nor recitative;
         only, to one's great joy, they are every now and then interrupted by a dance, or (to
         one's great sorrow) by a chorus that borders the stage from one end to the other,
         and screams, past all power of simile to represent. The second act was Baucis and
         Philemon. Baucis is a beautiful young shepherdess, and Philemon her swain. Jupiter
         falls in love with her, but nothing will prevail upon her; so it is all mighty well,
         and the chorus sing and dance the praises of Constancy. The two other acts were about
         Iphis and Ianthe, and the judgment of Paris. Imagine, I say, all this transacted by
         cracked voices, trilling divisions upon two notes and a half, accompanied by an orchestra
         of humstrums, and a whole house more attentive than if Farinelli sung, and you will
         almost have formed a just notion of the thing. Our astonishment at their absurdity
         you can never conceive; we had enough to do to express it by screaming an hour louder
         than the whole dramatis personæ. We have also seen twice the Comedie Françoise; first,
         the Mahomet Second, a tragedy that has had a great run of late; and the thing itself
         does not want its beauties, but the actors are beyond measure delightful. Mademoiselle
         Gaussin (Mr. Voltaire's Zara) has with a charming (though little) person the most
         pathetic tone of voice, the finest expression in her face, and most proper action
         imaginable. There is also a Dufrêne, who did the chief character, a handsome man and
         a prodigious fine actor. The second we saw was the Philosophe marié, and here they
         performed as well in comedy; there is a Mademoiselle Quinault, somewhat in Mrs. Clive's
         way, and a Monsieur Grandval, in the nature of Wilks, who is the genteelest thing
         in the world. There are several more would be much admired in England, and many (whom
         we have not seen) much celebrated here. Great part of our time is spent in seeing
         churches and palaces full of fine pictures, &amp;c., the quarter of which is not yet exhausted.
         For my part, I could entertain myself this month merely with the common streets and
         the people in them. [...]
