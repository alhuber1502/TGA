         <p> If I thought it necessary to offer an apology for venturing to address you in this abrupt manner, I should be very much at a loss
					how to begin. I might plead my admiration of your genius, and my attachment to your character; but who is he, that could not, with
					truth, urge the same excuse for intruding on your retirement? I might plead my earnest desire to be personally acquainted with a man
					whom I have so long and so passionately admired in his writings; but thousands, of greater consequence than I, are ambitious of the
					same honour. I, indeed, must either flatter myself that no apology is necessary, or otherwise, I must despair of obtaining what has
					long been the object of my most ardent wishes; I must for ever forfeit all hopes of seeing you, and conversing with you.</p>
         <p> It was yesterday I received the agreeable news of your being in Scotland, and of your intending to visit some parts of it. Will you
					permit us to hope, that we shall have an opportunity, at Aberdeen, of thanking you in person, for the honour you have done to Britain,
					and to the poetic art, by your inestimable compositions, and of offering you all that we have that deserves your acceptance, namely,
					hearts full of esteem, respect, and affection? If you cannot come so far northward, let me at least be acquainted with the place of
					your residence, and permitted to wait on you. Forgive, sir, this request; forgive me if I urge it with earnestness, for indeed it
					concerns me nearly;</p>
         <closer>
            <salute> and do me the justice to believe, that I am, with the most sincere attachment, and most respectful esteem, &amp;c. &amp;c.
						&amp;c. </salute>

            <p> P.S. D<hi rend="super">r</hi> Carlisle of Musselburgh, and D<hi rend="super">r</hi> Wight of Glasgow, acquainted me of your being in Scotland. It was from them I learned that my name was not
						wholly unknown to you.</p>
