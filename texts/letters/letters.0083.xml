         <p>I am this night arrived here, and have just set down to rest me after eight days tiresome journey: For the three first we had the
					same road we before past through to go to Geneva; the fourth we turned out of it, and for that day and the next travelled rather among
					than upon the Alps; the way commonly running through a deep valley by the side of the river Arc, which works itself a passage, with
					great difficulty and a mighty noise, among vast quantities of rocks, that have rolled down from the mountain tops. The winter was so
					far advanced, as in great measure to spoil the beauty of the prospect, however, there was still somewhat fine remaining amidst the
					savageness and horror of the place: The sixth we began to go up several of these mountains; and as we were passing one, met with an odd
					accident enough: Mr. Walpole had a little fat black spaniel, that he was very fond of, which he
					sometimes used to set down, and let it run by the chaise side. We were at that time in a very rough road, not two yards broad at most;
					on one side was a great wood of pines, and on the other a vast precipice; it was noon-day, and the sun shone bright, when all of a
					sudden, from the wood-side, (which was as steep upwards, as the other part was downwards) out rushed a great wolf, came close to the
					head of the horses, seized the dog by the throat, and rushed up the hill again with him in his mouth. This was done in less than a
					quarter of a minute; we all saw it, and yet the servants had not time to draw their pistols, or do any thing to save the dog. If he had
					not been there, and the creature had thought fit to lay hold of one of the horses; chaise, and we, and all must inevitably have tumbled
					above fifty fathoms perpendicular down the precipice. The seventh we came to Lanebourg, the last town
					in Savoy; it lies at the foot of the famous mount Cenis, which is so situated as to allow no room for any way but over the very top of
					it. Here the chaise was forced to be pulled to pieces, and the baggage and that to be carried by mules: We ourselves were wrapped up in
					our furs, and seated upon a sort of matted chair without legs, which is carried upon poles in the manner of a bier, and so begun to
					ascend by the help of eight men. It was six miles to the top, where a plain opens itself about as many more in breadth, covered
					perpetually with very deep snow, and in the midst of that a great lake of unfathomable depth, from whence a river takes its rise, and
					tumbles over monstrous rocks quite down the other side of the mountain. The descent is six miles more, but infinitely more steep than
					the going up; and here the men perfectly fly down with you, stepping from stone to stone with incredible swiftness in places where none
					but they could go three paces without falling. The immensity of the precipices, the roaring of the river and torrents that run into it,
					the huge craggs covered with ice and snow, and the clouds below you and about you, are objects it is impossible to conceive without
					seeing them; and though we had heard many strange descriptions of the scene, none of them at all came up to it. We were but five hours
					in performing the whole, from which you may judge of the rapidity of the men's motion. We are now got into Piedmont, and stopped a
					little while at La Ferriere, a small village about three quarters of the way down, but still among the clouds, where we began to hear a
					new language spoken round about us; at last we got quite down, went through the PÃ¡s de Suse, a narrow road among the Alps, defended by
					two fortresses, and lay at Bossolens: Next evening through a fine avenue of nine miles in length, as straight as a line, we arrived at
					this city, which, as you know, is the capital of the Principality, and the residence of the King of
					Sardinia. [...] We shall stay here, I believe, a fortnight, and proceed for Genoa, which is three or
					four days journey to go post.</p>
