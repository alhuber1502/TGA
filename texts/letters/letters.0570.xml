            <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I am afraid something is the matter with you, that I hear nothing from you, since I pass'd two days with you <hi rend="italic">in
						your absence.</hi>
					 I am not in Ireland, as you perhaps might imagine by this natural sentence: but shall be as glad to
					hear from you, as if I were.</p>
         <p>A week ago I saw something in the Newspaper sign'd <hi rend="italic">An Enemy to brick-walls in improper places.</hi> while I was
					studying how (for brevity's sake) to translate this into Greek, Mr Brown did it in one word, <hi rend="italic">Μασονίδης</hi>. I hope,
					it is not that complaint, hard (I must own) to digest, that sticks in your stomach, &amp; makes you thus silent.</p>
         <p>I am sorry to tell you, that I hear a very bad account of Dr Hurd: he was taken very ill at Thurcaston, &amp; obliged with difficulty to be carried in a chaise to Leicester. he remained there confined some time,
					before he could be convey'd on to London. as they do not mention, what his malady is, I am much afraid, it is a return of ye same
					disorder that he had last year in Town.
				</p>
         <p>I am going thither for a few days myself, &amp; shall soon be able to tell you more of him. </p>
         <p>Wyatt is return'd hither very calm, but melancholy, &amp; looking dreadfully pale: he thinks of
					orders, I am told.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu! I am ever<lb/> Yours </salute>
