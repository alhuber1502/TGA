         <div class="salute">My dear Doctor</div>
      </div>
      <p>It happen'd, that I was in London at the time, when St:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> received your letter relating to Mr. L:s request. as my name was mention'd in it,
         I ought to make my excuses to you as well as he, wch it is indeed easy to do, as I
         could by no means ask any thing but thro' him, &amp; (tho' this had been in my power)
         it would have been a very bad plea to say, my Ld, you have done me a very unexpected
         favour not long since; &amp; therefore I must beg you to do another at my desire for a
         Friend of mine. but the truth is, at this time our application could not have had
         any success, as our Principal would certainly never apply to three different Persons,
         with whom he has no connection; nor care to be refused, or even obliged by them. the
         inside of things can not be well explain'd by letters; but if you saw it, you would
         immediately see in its full light the impracticability of the thing.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I am lately return'd<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> from a six weeks ramble thro' Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Monmouthsh:re Herefordsh:re
         &amp; Shropshire, five of the most beautiful counties in the kingdom. the very light,
         &amp; principal feature in my journey was the river <span style="font-style:italic">Wye,</span> wch I descended in a boat for near 40 miles from Ross to Chepstow: its banks are
         a succession of nameless wonders: one out of many you may see not ill described by
         Mr. Whateley<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in his <span style="font-style:italic">Observations on Gardening</span> under the name of the <span style="font-style:italic">New-Weir</span>: he has also touch'd upon two others, <span style="font-style:italic">Tinterne-Abbey,</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Persfield</span> (Mr Morris's).<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> both of them famous scenes; &amp; both on the Wye. Monmouth, a town I never heard mention'd,
         lies on the same river in a vale, that is the delight of my eyes, &amp; the very seat
         of pleasure. the vale of Abergavenny, Ragland &amp; Chepstow-Castles, Ludlow, Malvern-hills,
         Hampton Court near Lemster,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Leasowes,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Hagley,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the three Cities &amp; their Cathedrals,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; lastly Oxford<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (where I past two days in my return with great satisfaction), are the rest of my
         acquisitions, &amp; no bad harvest to my thinking. I have a journal written by the companion<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of my travels, that serves to recall &amp; fix the fading images of these things.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I desire to hear of your health, &amp; that of your family. are Miss Wh:n &amp; Miss Peggy
         quite recover'd? my respects to Mrs. Wharton &amp; them.</p>
