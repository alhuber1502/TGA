         <p>I am ashamed of my own indolence in not answering your former letter: a second, wch I have since received, adds to my shame, &amp; quickens my motions. I can see no manner of objection to
					your design of publishing C: A:s works compleat in your own country. it will be an evidence of your
					regard for him, that can not but be very acceptable to him. the Glasgow-Press, or that of
						Baskervile, have given specimens of their art equal (at least) in beauty to any thing, that Europe
					can produce. the expence you will not much regard on such an occasion, &amp; (if you suffer them to be sold) that would be great
					diminish'd, and most probably reimbursed. as to notes (and I think, some will be necessary) I easily believe you will not overload the
					text with them, &amp; besides every thing of that kind will be concerted between you. if you propose any Vignettes or other matters of
					ornament, it would be well they were design'd in Italy, &amp; the gravings executed either there, or in France, for in this country
					they are woeful &amp; beyond measure dear. the revising of the Press must be your own labour, as tedious as it is inglorious: but to
					this you must submit. as we improve in our types, &amp;c: we grow daily more negligent in point of correctness, &amp; this even in our
					own tongue. what will it be in the Italian?</p>
         <p>I did not mean, you should have told C: A: my objection, at least not as from me, who have no
					pretence to take such a liberty with him: but I am glad, he has alter'd the passage. he can not wonder, if I wish'd to save to our
					nation the only honour it has in matters of Taste, &amp; no small one, since neither Italy nor France have ever had the least notion of
					it, nor yet do at all comprehend it, when they see it. Mr Mason has received the books in question from an unknown hand, wch I take to
					be Mr Holles, from whom I too have received a beautiful set of Engravings, as a present; I know not
					why, unless as a Friend of yours. I saw &amp; read the beginning of this year the <hi rend="italic">Congresso di Citéra,</hi>
					 &amp; was excessively pleased in spite of prejudice, for I am naturally no friend to allegory, nor
					to poetical prose. <hi rend="italic">entre nous</hi> what gives me the least pleasure of any of his writings, that I have seen, is the
						<hi rend="italic">Newtonianism.</hi>
					 it is so direct an imitation of Fontenelle, a Writer not easy to
					imitate, &amp; least of all in the Italian tongue, whose character &amp; graces are of a higher style &amp; never adapt themselves
					easily to the elegant <hi rend="italic">badinage</hi> and <hi rend="italic">legereté</hi> of conversation, that sets so well on the
					French: but this is a secret between us.</p>
         <p>I am glad to hear, he thinks of revisiting England tho' I am a little ashamed of my country at this present. our late-acquired glory
					does not set becomingly upon us; &amp; even the Author of it, that <hi rend="italic">Restitutor d'Inghilterra,</hi>
					 is doing God knows what! if he should deign to follow the track of vulgar Ministers, &amp; regain
					his power by ways injurious to his fame, whom can we trust hereafter?</p>
         <p>M: de Nivernois on his return to France, says (I hear) of England, Quel Roy, quel Peuple, quelle
					Societé! &amp; so say I.</p>
