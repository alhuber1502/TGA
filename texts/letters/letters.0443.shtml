      <p>I return you abundance of thanks for Ld Herbert &amp; for the Pamphlet. the first is exceedingly
         defective in its Commas &amp; Semicolons. the latter has a misfortune attends it (not
         at all in your power to remedy) that few or none had read the Address, wch occasion'd
         it. if they do now, it is your doing.
      </p>
      <p>I shall probably be in Town in about a fortnight, where I hope to have the pleasure
         of seeing you.
