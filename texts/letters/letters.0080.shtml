      <p>If wishes could turn to realities, I would fling down my law books, and sup with you
         to-night. But, alas, here am I doomed to fix, while you are fluttering from city to
         city, and enjoying all the pleasures which a gay climate can afford. It is out of
         the power of my heart to envy your good fortune, yet I cannot help indulging a few
         natural desires; as for example, to take a walk with you on the banks of the Rhône,
         and to be climbing up mount Fourviere;
      </p>

         <p>Jam mens prætrepidans avet vagari: <br /> Jam læti studio pedes vigescunt.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      </div>
      <p>However, so long as I am not deprived of your correspondence, so long shall I always
         find some pleasure in being at home. And, setting all vain curiosity aside, when the
         fit is over, and my reason begins to come to herself, I have several other powerful
         motives which might easily cure me of my restless inclinations: Amongst these, my
         Mother's ill state of health is not the least; which was the reason of our going to
         Tunbridge, so that you cannot expect much description or amusement from thence. Nor
         indeed is there much room for either; for all diversions there may be reduced to two
         articles, gaming and going to church. They were pleased to publish certain Tunbrigiana
         this season; but such ana! I believe there were never so many vile little verses put
         together before. So much for Tunbridge: London affords me as little to say. What!
         so huge a town as London? Yes, consider only how I live in that town. I never go into
         the gay or high world, and consequently receive nothing from thence to brighten my
         imagination. The busy world I leave to the busy; and am resolved never to talk politics
         till I can act at the same time. To tell old stories, or prate of old books, seems
         a little musty; and toujours Chapon bouilli, won't do. However, for want of better
         fare, take another little mouthful of my poetry.
