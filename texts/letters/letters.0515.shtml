         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>Many &amp; various maladies have I labour'd under, since I left the north, but none of
         them (thanks to my summer expedition) <span style="font-style:italic">jusqu' a mourir.</span> the gout came regularly, while I was in town, first in one, then in the other foot,
         but so tame<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you might have stroked it. since I got hither, <span style="font-style:italic">another</span> of my troublesome companions for life has confined me to my room, but abstinence
         has (I believe) got the better of that too, &amp; to-morrow I go abroad again. I sent
         to your brother,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> before I left London, the <span style="font-style:italic">maps</span> you wanted, the <span style="font-style:italic">Decouvertes des Russes,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <span style="font-style:italic">Voyage de Gmelin en Siberie,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mr. Clerke of Chichester <span style="font-style:italic">on the Saxon coins,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Lee's <span style="font-style:italic">LinnÃ¦an Dictionary,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <span style="font-style:italic">Verrall's Cookery,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; something else that I have forgot. as to Hudson's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <span style="font-style:italic">Flora Anglica</span> it is not to be had, being out of print: a new &amp; more correct edition is soon expected.
         Willughby's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> book of <span style="font-style:italic">fishes</span> was never publish'd in English, so would not answer your end. that of <span style="font-style:italic">Birds</span> is indeed in English, but not to be had in the shops &amp; sells at auctions from 30
         to 40 shillings, so I did not buy it without farther orders. I hope this cargo is
         safe arrived; &amp; another little one, that I sent to Miss Wharton &amp; Miss Peggy, directed
         to the former, to be left at Mr Tho: Wilkinson's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in Durham: this went by the Newcastle Waggon about 6th of Dec:, &amp; contain'd twelve
         Flower-roots, viz: 3 Soleil d'or Narcissus, 2 White Italian dÂ°: (N:B: of the Double
         white &amp; yellow Italian there are none to be had this year) 2 Pileus Cardinalis, red;
         1 Kroon-vogel, 1 Degeraad, double White; 1 Belle Grisdelin. 1 Hermaphrodite, &amp; 1 Incomparable,
         double blew; Hyacinths. for these you must get glasses from Newcastle. in the same
         box was a pocket Lens, wch Miss Wh:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (if she pleased) was to give to Aunt Middleton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who wanted such a thing.</p>
      <p>I desire to know, what you thought of Mason's plan<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for your ground (wch makes so pretty a figure on paper); &amp; whether <span style="font-style:italic">Summers</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> came to Old-Park to advise about planting. he is a very intelligent modest young
         Man, &amp; might be of great use there. has Miss Wh: served her time yet as a Bride-maid?
         I hope it may prove a good omen to her! does Miss Peggy<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> rival Claude Lorraine yet, &amp; when does she go to York? do Debo<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Betty<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> tend their Chrysalises, &amp; their samplers? is Kee's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> mouth as pretty as ever? does Robin<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> read like a Doctor, dance like a Fairy, &amp; bow like a Courtier? does Dicky<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> kick up his heels, &amp; study Geography? please to answer me as to all these particulars.
         my Thermometer presents her compliments to her country-sister, &amp; proposes now to open
         a correspondence with her. she lives against a pale in the garden with her back to
         the East at 9 o'clock in the morning precisely: at any other hour she is not visible,
         unless upon some great occasion. I was in London from 3 Nov: to 14 Dec:,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> during wch time the weather was commonly open, damp, &amp; mild, with the wind in the
         West, veering either to N: or S:. on the last mention'd day I found some Brambles
         &amp; Feverfew yet flowering in the hedges, &amp; in gardens the double Chrysanthemum, double
         Chamomile, Borage, Stocks, &amp; single Wall-flowers. these were all cut off on the 24th
         by an E: wind &amp; hard frost, Therm: at 31. next day &amp; today it was at 30. on the 26th
         a little snow fell, wch still lies &amp; freezes.</p>
      <p>Our Ministry<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has taken in some odd Coadjutors not much to its credit or strength. it appear'd
         from the first day the Parliament met, that the Opposition were all to pieces among
         themselves, &amp; soon after the Duke of Bedf:d civilly declared to Mr Grenville, that
         he had the highest opinion of his abilities: but as it was contrary to his principles
         to keep up a constant opposition to the K:s measures, he must not wonder, if his Friends
         should drop the plan they had for sometime been pursuing. accordingly he made his
         terms, four or five of them were directly to be provided for: the rest were to wait
         till there was room.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Ld Shelburne<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (the Sec:y), &amp; Mr Cook<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (Joint-Paymaster) were to have gone out, but Ld Chatham insisted on their staying
         in (it is said) &amp; prevail'd. Mr Conway retires,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; is to have the army, when Ld Ligonier dies: this is voluntary, I imagine. Ld Northington<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> goes off with his pension. Ld Weymouth,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Earl Gower<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> supply their places, Mr Thynne<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is Master of ye Houshold. Ld Sandwich, Joint-Postmaster<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (Ld Hillsborough<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> being created Secretary of State for America) Rigby<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is the other, that must come in (to what place I know not) &amp; conduct, I suppose,
         the House of Commons. how much better &amp; nobler would it have been to have left all
         these Beggars in the lurch? indeed what could be said against it, as all that could
         oppose the Ministry were already broke into three parts,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; one of them<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> had declared publickly against the other two? I conclude the Rockingham-party will
         at last prevail, as they have some character &amp; credit with the People still left.</p>
      <p>Adieu, my dear Sr. you have had, I hope, no returns of your asthma, since you lay
         in your own bed. my best respects to Mrs Wharton, &amp; love to all the family.</p>

            Raby is the largest Castel of Logginges in al the Northcuntery, &amp; is of a strong building:
            but not set ether on hil, or very strong ground. as I enterid by a causey into it
            there was a litle stagne on the right hond, and in the first area were but two toures,

            Hart. the great Chaumber was exceding large, but now it is false-rofid, and devidid
            into 2 or 3 Partes. I saw ther a litle chaumber, wherein was in windows of colorid
