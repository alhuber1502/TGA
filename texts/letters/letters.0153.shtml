      </div>
      <p>You ask me, what I would answer in case any one should ask me a certain Question concerning
         You. In my Conscience, I should say, Yes; &amp; the readier as I have had a Revelation
         about it: 'twas in a Dream that told me you had taken a Fancy to one of the four last
         Letters in the Alphabet. I think it can't be X, nor Z (for I know of no female Zeno,
         or Xenophon) it may be Y perhaps, but I have somehow a secret Partiality for W. am
         I near it, or no? by this Time I suppose, 'tis almost a done Thing. there is no struggling
         with Destiny, so I acquiesce. thus far only I should be glad to know with Certainty,
         whither it be likely [you] should continue in Statu Quo, till the Commencement (wch
         I dont conceive) for o[therwise] I should think it rather better for [T:] to give
         up his Pretensions with a good Grace, than to wait the Pleasure of those dirty Cubs,
         who will infallibly prefer the first that offers of their own People. but I submit
         this to your Judgement, who (as you first made him a Competitor) ought to determine
         at what Time he may most decently withdraw. I have some Uneasiness too on Brown's
         Account, who has sacrificed all his Interests with so much Frankness, &amp; is still so
         resolute to do every Thing for us without Reserve, that I should see him with great
         Concern under the Paw of a fell Visitor, &amp; exposed to the Insolence of that old Rascal,
         the Master. Tr:pe (if you remember) would engage himself no longer than the end of
         this Year? 'tis true he has never said any thing since, tending that Way; but he is
         not unlikely to remember it at a proper Time. and as to Sm:, he must necessarily be
         abîmé, in a very short Time. his Debts daily increase (you remember the State they
         were in, when you left us) Addison, I know, wrote smartly to him last Week; but it
         has had no Effect, that signifies. only I observe he takes Hartshorn from Morning
         to Night lately: in the mean time he is amuseing himself with a Comedy of his own
         Writeing, wch he makes all the Boys of his Acquaintance act, &amp; intends to borrow the
         Zodiack Room, &amp; have it performed publickly. our Friend Lawman, the mad Attorney,
         is his Copyist; &amp; truly the Author himself is to the full as mad as he. his Piece
         (he says) is inimitable, true Sterling Wit, &amp; Humour by God; &amp; he can't hear the Prologue
         without being ready to die with Laughter. he acts five Parts himself, &amp; is only sorry,
         he can't do all the rest. he has also advertised a Collection of Odes; &amp; for his Vanity
         &amp; Faculty of Lyeing, they are come to their full Maturity. all this, you see, must
         come to a Jayl, or Bedlam, &amp; that without any help, almost without Pity. by the Way
         now I talk of a Jayl, please to let me know, when &amp; where you would have me pay my
         own Debts.

      <p>Chapman (I suppose you know) is warm in his Mastership. soon after his Accession I
         was to see him: there was a very brillant (Cambridge) Assembly, Middleton, Rutherforth,
         Heberden, Robinson, Coventry, &amp; various others. he did the Honours with a great Deal
         of comical Dignity, assisted by a Bedmaker in greasy Leather Breeches &amp; a Livery,
         &amp; now he is gone to Town to get Preferment. but what you'll wonder at &amp; what delights
         me, Coventry is his particular Confident (tho' very disagreeably to himself) he can't
         open his Door, but he finds the Master there, who comes to set with him at all Hours,
         &amp; brings his Works with him, for he is writeing a great Book on the Roman Constitution.
         well, upon the Strength of this I too am grown very great with Coventry, &amp; to say
         the Truth (bateing his Nose, &amp; another Circumstance, wch is nothing to me) he is the
         best Sort of Man in this Place. M:n has publish'd a small Oct:vo on the Roman Senate,
         well enough, but nothing of very great Consequence, &amp; is now gone to be inducted into
         a Sine-Cure (not £100 a-Year) that Sr J: Frederick gave him. what's worse, for the
         Sake of this little nasty Thing (I am told) he is determined to suppress a Work, that
         would have made a great Noise, or publish it all mangled &amp; disfigured, &amp; this when
         he has (I am assured) near 700£ a-year of his own already, &amp; might live independent,
         &amp; easy, and speak his Mind in the Face of the whole World Clerical and Laïcal. such
         a Passion have some Men to lick the Dust, &amp; be trampled upon. the Fellow-Com[mo]ners
         (the Bucks) are run mad, they set Women upon their Heads in the Streets at [noon]
         day, break open Shops, game in the Coffee-houses on Sundays, &amp; in short act after
         my [own] Heart.
      </p>
      <p>My Works are not so considerable as you imagine. I have read Pausania[s and Athe]næus
         all thro', &amp; Æschylus again. I am now in Pindar &amp; Lysias: for I take Verse and Prose
         together, like Bread &amp; Cheese. the Chronology is growing daily. the most noble of
         my Performances latterly is a Pôme on the uncommon Death of Mr W:s Cat. wch being
         of a proper Size &amp; Subject for a Gentleman in your Condition to peruse (besides that
         I flatter myself, Miss — will give her Judgement upon it too), I herewith send you.
         it won't detain you long.

         <p>On a favourite Cat, call'd Selima, that fell into a China Tub with Gold-Fishes in
