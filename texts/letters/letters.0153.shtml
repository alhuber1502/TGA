         <div class="salute">My Dear Wharton</div>
      </div>
      <p>You ask me, what I would answer in case any one should ask me a certain Question concerning
         You.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> In my Conscience, I should say, Yes; &amp; the readier as I have had a Revelation about
         it: 'twas in a Dream that told me you had taken a Fancy to one of the four last Letters
         in the Alphabet. I think it can't be X, nor Z (for I know of no female Zeno, or Xenophon)
         it may be Y perhaps, but I have somehow a secret Partiality for W.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> am I near it, or no? by this Time I suppose, 'tis almost a done Thing. there is no
         struggling with Destiny, so I acquiesce. thus far only I should be glad to know with
         Certainty, whither it be likely [you]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> should continue in Statu Quo,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> till the Commencement<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (wch I dont conceive) for o[therwise]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I should think it rather better for [T:]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to give up his Pretensions with a good Grace, than to wait the Pleasure of those
         dirty Cubs, who will infallibly prefer the first that offers of their own People.
         but I submit this to your Judgement, who (as you first made him a Competitor) ought
         to determine at what Time he may most decently withdraw. I have some Uneasiness too
         on Brown's Account, who has sacrificed all his Interests with so much Frankness, &amp;
         is still so resolute to do every Thing for us without Reserve, that I should see him
         with great Concern under the Paw of a fell Visitor, &amp; exposed to the Insolence of
         that old Rascal, the Master. Tr:pe<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (if you remember) would engage himself no longer than the end of this Year? 'tis
         true he has never said any thing since, tending that Way; but he is not unlikely to
         remember it at a proper Time. and as to Sm:,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he must necessarily be abîmé, in a very short Time. his Debts daily increase (you
         remember the State they were in, when you left us) Addison,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I know, wrote smartly to him last Week; but it has had no Effect, that signifies.
         only I observe he takes Hartshorn from Morning to Night lately: in the mean time he
         is amuseing himself with a Comedy<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of his own Writeing, wch he makes all the Boys of his Acquaintance act, &amp; intends
         to borrow the Zodiack Room,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; have it performed publickly.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> our Friend Lawman, the mad Attorney, is his Copyist;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; truly the Author himself is to the full as mad as he. his Piece (he says) is inimitable,
         true Sterling Wit, &amp; Humour by God; &amp; he can't hear the Prologue without being ready
         to die with Laughter. he acts five Parts himself, &amp; is only sorry, he can't do all
         the rest. he has also advertised a Collection of Odes;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; for his Vanity &amp; Faculty of Lyeing, they are come to their full Maturity. all this,
         you see, must come to a Jayl, or Bedlam,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; that without any help, almost without Pity. by the Way now I talk of a Jayl, please
         to let me know, when &amp; where you would have me pay my own Debts.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Chapman<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (I suppose you know) is warm in his Mastership. soon after his Accession I was to
         see him: there was a very brillant<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (Cambridge) Assembly, Middleton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Rutherforth,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Heberden,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Robinson,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Coventry,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; various others. he did the Honours with a great Deal of comical Dignity, assisted
         by a Bedmaker in greasy Leather Breeches &amp; a Livery, &amp; now he is gone to Town to get
         Preferment. but what you'll wonder at &amp; what delights me, Coventry is his particular
         Confident (tho' very disagreeably to himself) he can't open his Door, but he finds
         the Master there, who comes to set<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with him at all Hours, &amp; brings his Works with him, for he is writeing a great Book
         on the Roman Constitution. well, upon the Strength of this I too am grown very great
         with Coventry, &amp; to say the Truth (bateing his Nose,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; another Circumstance, wch is nothing to me) he is the best Sort of Man in this
         Place. M:n<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has publish'd a small Oct:vo on the Roman Senate, well enough, but nothing of very
         great Consequence, &amp; is now gone to be inducted into a Sine-Cure (not £100 a-Year)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that Sr J: Frederick<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> gave him. what's worse, for the Sake of this little nasty Thing (I am told) he is
         determined to suppress a Work,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that would have made a great Noise, or publish it all mangled &amp; disfigured, &amp; this
         when he has (I am assured) near 700£ a-year of his own already, &amp; might live independent,
         &amp; easy, and speak his Mind in the Face of the whole World Clerical and Laïcal. such
         a Passion have some Men to lick the Dust, &amp; be trampled upon. the Fellow-Com[mo]ners<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (the Bucks) are run mad, they set Women upon their Heads in the Streets at [noon]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> day, break open Shops, game in the Coffee-houses on Sundays, &amp; in short act after
         my [own]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Heart.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>My Works are not so considerable as you imagine. I have read Pausania[s and Athe]næus<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> all thro', &amp; Æschylus again. I am now in Pindar<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Lysias: for I take Verse and Prose together, like Bread &amp; Cheese. the Chronology<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is growing daily. the most noble of my Performances latterly is a Pôme on the uncommon
         Death of Mr W:s<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Cat. wch being of a proper Size &amp; Subject for a Gentleman in your Condition to peruse
         (besides that I flatter myself, Miss — will give her Judgement upon it too), I herewith
         send you. it won't detain you long.</p>

         <p>On a favourite Cat, call'd Selima, that fell into a China Tub<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with Gold-Fishes in it &amp; was drown'd</p> 
         <p>'Twas on a lofty Vase's Side, <br /> Where China's gayest Art had dyed <br /> The azure Flowers that blow: <br /> Demurest of the Tabby Kind, <br /> The pensive Selima reclined <br /> Gazed on the Lake below.<br /> <br /> Her conscious Tail her Joy declared. <br /> The fair round Face, the snowy Beard, <br /> The Velvet of her Paws, <br /> Her Coat, that with the Tortoise vyes, <br /> Her Ears of Jett, &amp; Emerald Eyes <br /> She saw, &amp; purr'd Applause. <br /> <br /> Still had she gazed, but 'midst the Tide <br /> Two angel-Forms were seen to glide, <br /> The Genii of the Stream: <br /> Their scaly Armour's Tyrian Hue <br /> Thro' richest Purple to the View <br /> Betray'd a golden Gleam.<br /> <br /> The hapless Nymph with Wonder saw. <br /> A Whisker first, &amp; then a Claw, <br /> With many an ardent Wish, <br /> She stretch'd in vain to reach the Prize. <br /> What female Heart can Gold despise? <br /> What Cat's averse to Fish? <br /> <br /> Presumptuous Maid! with Eyes intent <br /> Again she stretch'd, again she bent <br /> Nor knew the Gulph between. <br /> Malignant Fate sate by, &amp; smiled. <br /> The slippery Verge her Feet beguiled: <br /> She tumbled headlong in.<br /> <br /> Eight Times emergeing from the Flood <br /> She mew'd to ev'ry watry God <br /> Some speedy Aid to send <br /> No Dolphin came, no Nereïd stirr'd, <br /> Nor cruel Tom, nor Harry heard. <br /> A Fav'rite has no Friend!<br /> <br /> From hence, ye Beauties, undeceiv'd <br /> Know, one false Step is ne'er retrieved, <br /> And be with Caution bold. <br /> Not all, that strikes your wand'ring Eyes, <br /> And heedless Hearts is lawful Prize, <br /> Nor all, that glisters, Gold.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
