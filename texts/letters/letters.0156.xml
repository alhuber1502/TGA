         <p>I am not dead, neither sleep I so sound, as not to feel the Jog you give me, or to forget that I ought to have wrote before. but I
					have been on the Confines of that Land, where all Things are forgotten; &amp; return'd from thence with a Loss of Appetite &amp; of
					Spirits, that has made me a very silly Gentleman, &amp; not worth your Correspondence. however I am tolerable well again, &amp; came
					post hither on Friday to see my Mother [ ] she was then at the
					Extremity, but is far better at present: I have no Business to regale you with all [t]his, but it is
					only by Way of Excuse. on Monday next I hope to return home, &amp; in my Way (probably on Tuesday Morning) to call at your Door, &amp;
					that of the Chuteheds, if possible.</p>
         <p>I am obliged to you for transcribeing Voltaire &amp; Mr Lyttleton. the last has six good prettyish
					Lines. the other I do not much admire <q>
               <p>Ni sa Flute, ni son EpÃ©e.</p>
            </q> the Thought is Martial's, &amp; many others after him; &amp; the Verses frippery enough, as his easy Poetry usually is. nobody
					loves him better than I in his grander Style. </p>
