      <p>I can not help thanking you for your kind letter, tho' I have nothing essential to
         inform you of in return.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Ld S:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; his brother<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are come back, &amp; in some measure rid me of my apprehensions for the College. S:l<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is gone to Town, but (as he assures me) not to stay above a week. you advise me to
         be happy, &amp; would to God it depended upon your wishes. a part of what I imagined,
         has already happen'd here, tho' not in the way I expected.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in a way indeed, that confutes itself, &amp; therefore (as I am told) makes no impression
         on the hearers. but I will not answer for the truth of this: at least such, as are
         strangers to me, may be influenced by it. however tho' I know the quarter, whence
         it comes, I can not interpose at present, lest I make the matter worse. judge you
         of my happiness, may yours never meet with any cloud or interruption.
