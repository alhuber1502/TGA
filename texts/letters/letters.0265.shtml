      <p>I can not help thanking you for your kind letter, tho' I have nothing essential to
         inform you of in return. Ld S: &amp; his brother are come back, &amp; in some measure rid
         me of my apprehensions for the College. S:l is gone to Town, but (as he assures me)
         not to stay above a week. you advise me to be happy, &amp; would to God it depended upon
         your wishes. a part of what I imagined, has already happen'd here, tho' not in the
         way I expected. in a way indeed, that confutes itself, &amp; therefore (as I am told)
         makes no impression on the hearers. but I will not answer for the truth of this: at
         least such, as are strangers to me, may be influenced by it. however tho' I know the
         quarter, whence it comes, I can not interpose at present, lest I make the matter worse.
         judge you of my happiness, may yours never meet with any cloud or interruption.
      </p>
