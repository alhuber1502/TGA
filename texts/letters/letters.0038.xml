				     <p>I think this is the first time, I have had any Occasion to find fault with Sr R:s Male-Administration, and if he should keep you in
					town another Week, I don't know whether I shan't change my Side, &amp; write a Craftsman; I am extreme
					Sorry, I could not dine with you last Sunday, but I really was engaged at Peter-house, &amp; did not know of the honour you intended
					me, till night; if it had not been for a great cold I had got, I certainly should have come post to Supper: I engage myself to drink
					Tea with you at King's the day after to morrow, for then we expect you; I mean me, for Ashton is to try not to expect you then: I
					believe I shall stay here till February, so pray, come hither, if that can be any part of a reason for it: the Moderatour has asked me to make the Tripos-Verses this year; they say the University has sent a Letter by the Post to thank my Lord Townsend for the Statue! I have had a Letter from West with an Elegy of Tibullus translated in it,
					<hi rend="spaced">thus long</hi>; I have wrote you a letter with 50 I's in it, besides me's and we's,
					and I am,</p>
