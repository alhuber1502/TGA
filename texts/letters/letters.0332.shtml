         <div class="salute">Dear Mr Gray </div>
      </div>
      <p>I cannot help sending you a line to desire that if you can spare a moment from buying
         &amp; selling of South sea annuities, taking inventorys of Old China jars &amp; three legd
         stools with black feet &amp; grass-green velvit bottoms, you would write me word how you
         do. I ask not criticisms, nor hints, nor emendations these at your leisure, for my
         tythes are come in, I live within tolerable compass &amp; therefore I care not a fig whether
         Caractacus goes forth or no, evn tho he should bring me as much as Cleone did to my
         Printer they both begin with a C wch is a good omen.
      </p>
      <p>Since your last I writ as you bid me (or to speak more gramatically) bad me to Mr.
         H &amp; recd his answer he says, "I coud not but smile at Dr Whartons petition. As what
         I had to say of that wretch was no extraordinary pass of pate I may the easier be
         inducd to make a sacrifice of it to <span style="font-style:italic">Humanity.</span> Yet I promise nothing. there will be time enough to think of this for the publication
         is necessarily delayd by the late accident for sometime."
      </p>
      <p>This accident was no less than the [loss of the] MS. of his last dialogue on the Constitution,
         by the carelessness of a Leicester bookseller, &amp; he is afraid wont be recoverd if
         so hell have it all to compose afresh from some loose notes. This youll say is a warning
         for Caractacus, &amp; indeed it does not suit his dignity to ride Post, like a lad newly
         elected at Whites He shall therefore stay with you; for Hurd is returning to Thurcaston
         &amp; I fancy will come to see me, if not Ill go to see him with my own Copy, before I
         think of publishing. I send you at the Bottom a peice of a new stanza for the 2d Ode.
         I know not if you will not think the rhymes too antiquated, or whether it is not a
         sort of Beauty in the place –
      </p>

         <p>Evry Heath &amp; Mountain rude <br /> Was mute till then, save from the den <br /> Where watchd some Giant proud, <br /> The Heifer, cag'd in craggy pen, <br /> Lifted her lowings loud; <br /> While her fair firstlings streaming gore <br /> Distaind the bone-besprinkled floor. <br /> Dismal notes! &amp; answered soon.
