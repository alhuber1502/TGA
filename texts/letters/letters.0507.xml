				     <p>I have been at Hartlepool like any thing, &amp; since that visiting about (wch is the ruin of all my country-expeditions) so that I
					was not able to write to you sooner. tomorrow I go <hi rend="italic">vizzing</hi> to Gibside to see
					the new-married Countess, whom (bless my eyes!) I have seen here already: there I drop our beatified
						Friend, who goes into Scotland with them; &amp; return hither all alone. soon after I hope to go into
					Cumberland, &amp;c: &amp; when that is over, shall let you know.</p>
				     <p>I exceedingly approve the Epitaph in its present shape: even what I had best liked before is alter'd
					for the better. the various readings I do not mind, only perhaps, I should read the 2d line <q>
						         <p>Grace, that with tenderness &amp; sense combined <lb/> To form &amp;c:</p>
					       </q> for I hate <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> in verse. I will say nothing to <hi rend="italic">Taste &amp; Truth,</hi> for perhaps
					the A:p may fancy they are fine things, but to my palate they are Wormwood. all the rest is just as it should be, &amp; what he ought
					to admire.</p>
				     <p>Billy Hervey went directly to Durham, &amp; call'd not here. he danced at the Assembly with a
					conquering mien, &amp; all the Misses swear, he is the genteelest thing they ever set eyes on, &amp; wants nothing but two feet more in
					height. the Doctor &amp; Mr Brown send their blessing, &amp; I am ever </p>
