         <div class="salute">Sir, </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am infinitely obliged to you for the Favour of your Letter. Your Plan for the <span style="font-style:italic">History of English Poetry</span> is admirably constructed; and much improved from an Idea of Pope, which Mr Mason
         obligingly sent me by Application from our Friend Dr Hurd. I regrett that a writer
         of your consummate Taste should not have executed it.
      </p>
      <p>Although I have not followed this Plan, yet it is of great service to me, and throws
         much light on many of my Periods, by giving connected views and Details. I begin with
         such an introduction, or general Dissertation, as you had intended: viz. on the Northern
         Poetry with its introduction into England by the Danes and Saxons, &amp; its duration.
         I then begin my <span style="font-style:italic">History</span> at the conquest which I write chronologically in Sections; and continue, as matter
         successively offers itself, in a series of regular Annals, down to &amp; beyond the Restoration.
         I think with you, that Dramatic poetry is detached from the idea of my work, that
         it requires a separate consideration, &amp; will swell the size of my book beyond all
         bounds. One of my Sections, a very large one, is entirely on Chaucer, and exactly
         fills your Title of <span style="font-style:italic">Part Second.</span> In the course of my Annals I consider collaterally the Poetry of different Nations
         as influencing our own. What I have at present finished ends with the section on Chaucer,
         &amp; will almost make my first Volume; for I design two Volumes in quarto. This first
         Volume will soon be in the press. I should have said before, that although I proceed
         chronologically, yet I often stand still to give some general view, as perhaps of
         a <span style="font-style:italic">particular species</span> of poetry, &amp;c. and even <span style="font-style:italic">anticipate</span> sometimes for this purpose. These <span style="font-style:italic">views</span> often form <span style="font-style:italic">one</span> Section; yet are interwoven into the Tenor of the work without interrupting my historical
         series. In this respect, some of my Sections have the effect of your <span style="font-style:italic">Parts</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Divisions.</span></p>
      <p>You do me a favour in requesting me to pay an attention to Mr Stiguer. I return to
         Oxford in a few Days, when I will make it my business to find him out, and to introduce
         him according to your wishes. I do not know his College, nor have I heard of his name.
         But he will easily be found out.
      </p>
      <p>I cannot take my Leave without declaring, that my strongest incitement to prosecute
         the <span style="font-style:italic">History of English Poetry</span> is the pleasing hope of being approved by you; whose <span style="font-style:italic">true genius</span> I so justly venerate, and whose <span style="font-style:italic">genuine Poetry</span> has ever given me such sincere pleasure.
      </p>
