   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>I am obliged to you for Mr. Dodsley's book,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and, having pretty well looked it over, will (as you desire) tell you my opinion
         of it. He might, methinks, have spared the Graces<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in his frontispiece, if he chose to be œconomical, and dressed his authors in a little
         more decent raiment – not in whited-brown paper and distorted characters, like an
         old ballad. I am ashamed to see myself;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but the company keeps me in countenance: so to begin with Mr. Tickell.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> This is not only a statepoem (my ancient aversion), but a state-poem on the peace
         of Utrecht.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> If Mr. Pope had wrote a panegyric on it, one could hardly have read him with patience:
         but this is only a poor short-winded imitator of Addison, who had himself not above
         three or four notes in poetry; sweet enough indeed, like those of a German flute,
         but such as soon tire and satiate the ear with their frequent return. Tickell has
         added to this a great poverty of sense, and a string of transitions that hardly become
         a schoolboy. However, I forgive him for the sake of his ballad,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which I always thought the prettiest in the world. All there is of M. Green<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> here has been printed before: there is a profusion of wit every where; reading would
         have formed his judgment, and harmonized his verse, for even his wood-notes often
         break out into strains of real poetry and music. The Schoolmistress<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is excellent in its kind, and masterly; and (I am sorry to differ from you, but)
         London<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is to me one of those few imitations, that have all the ease and all the spirit of
         an original. The same man's verses at the opening of Garrick's theatre<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are far from bad. Mr. Dyer<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (here you will despise me highly) has more of poetry in his imagination, than almost
         any of our number; but rough and injudicious.
      </p>
      <p>I should range Mr. Bramston<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> only a step or two above Dr. King,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who is as low in my estimation as in yours. Dr. Evans<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is a furious madman; and Pre-existence<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is nonsense in all her altitudes. Mr. Lyttelton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is a gentle elegiac person: Mr. Nugent<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> sure did not write his own ode.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I like Mr. Whitehead's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> little poems, I mean the Ode on a tent, the Verses to Garrick, and particularly those
         to Charles Townshend, better than any thing I had seen before of him. I gladly pass
         over H. Brown,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and the rest, to come at you. You know I was of the publishing side, and thought
         your reasons against it none; for though, as Mr. Chute said extremely well, the <span style="font-style:italic">still small voice</span> of Poetry was not made to be heard in a crowd; yet Satire will be heard, for all
         the audience are by nature her friends; especially when she appears in the spirit
         of Dryden, with his strength, and often with his versification; such as you have caught
         in those lines on the royal unction, on the papal dominion, and convents of both sexes,
         on Henry VIII. and Charles II. for these are to me the shining parts of your Epistle.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> There are many lines I could wish corrected, and some blotted out, but beauties enough
         to atone for a thousand worse faults than these. The opinion of such as can at all
         judge, who saw it before in Dr. Middleton's hands, concurs nearly with mine. As to
         what any one says, since it came out; our people (you must know) are slow of judgement;
         they wait till some bold body saves them the trouble, and then follow his opinion;
         or stay till they hear what is said in town, that is at some bishop's table, or some
         coffee-house about the Temple. When they are determined, I will tell you faithfully
         their verdict.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> As for the Beauties,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I am their most humble servant. What shall I say to Mr. Lowth,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mr. Ridley,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mr. Rolle,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the reverend Mr. Brown,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Seward,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c.? If I say, Messieurs! this is not the thing; write prose, write sermons, write
         nothing at all; they will disdain me, and my advice. What then would the sickly peer<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> have done, that spends so much time in admiring everything that has four legs, and
         fretting at his own misfortune in having but two; and cursing his own politic head
         and feeble constitution, that won't let him be such a beast as he would wish? Mr.
         S. Jenyns<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> now and then can write a good line or two – such as these –
      </p>
      <div class="q">

      <p>I like Mr. Aston Hervey's fable;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and an ode<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (the last of all) by Mr. Mason,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a new acquaintance of mine, whose Musæus too seems to carry with it the promise at
         least of something good to come. I was glad to see you distinguished who poor West
         was, before his charming ode,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and called it anything rather than a Pindaric. The town is an owl, if it don't like
         Lady Mary,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and I am surprised at it: we here are owls enough to think her eclogues<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> very bad; but that I did not wonder at. Our present taste is sir T. Fitz-Osborne's
         Letters.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I send you a bit of a thing for two reasons: first, because it is one of your favourites,
         Mr. M. Green;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and next, because I would do justice. The thought on which my second ode<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> turns is manifestly stole from hence: – not that I knew it at the time, but, having<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> seen this many Years before, to be sure it imprinted itself on my Memory, &amp; forgetting
         the Author, I took it for my own. the Subject was the Queen's Hermitage.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>

         <p>P:S: If You chance to see a Letter of mine in any body's Hand, this is the History
            of it. Dr Whalley,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who has hated me ever since that Affair of Mr Turner,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> thought fit to intimate to a large Table full of People, that I was a Kind of Atheist.
            I wrote to him partly to laugh at, &amp; partly to reprove him for his Malice; &amp; (as what
            he said was publick) I shew'd my Letter to several of those, who had heard him; &amp;
            threaten'd (not in earnest, you may imagine) to have it hawk'd about Streets. they
            took me literally, &amp; by Way of Anticipation my Letter has been consign'd to one Etoffe<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (a Fiend of a Parson, that you know) to shew about here, &amp; to carry to Town, if any
