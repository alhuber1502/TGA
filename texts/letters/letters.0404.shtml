         <p>Commanding Beauty smooth'd by chearful grace <br /> Sat on each open feature of his face. <br /> Bold was his language, rapid, glowing, strong, <br /> And science flow'd spontaneous from his tongue: <br /> A Genius big with system, slighting rules! <br /> Gall he had none, but boundless scorn of Fools. <br /> Ambition lent her flambeau to his hand, <br /> And Bacchus sprinkled fuel on the brand. <br /> His wish to counsel Monarchs or controul; <br /> His only means â€“ the ardour of his soul! <br /> Down came at once the fabrick of his pride, <br /> Yet slightly-built diffused no ruin wide; <br /> +Unhurt, undaunted, undisturb'd, he fell <br /> +Could laugh the same, &amp; the same stories tell: <br /> Tho' headlong from his airy scaffold hurl'd, <br /> He held his bottle fast, &amp; drop'd the World.

      <p>I make no excuses for the four lines I have omitted. there are two more I could not
         find in my heart to omitt (good reason why!) &amp; yet think it would be better, if they
         were not there.
