         <p> My letter enjoys itself, before its open'd, in imagining the Confusion you'll be in, when you hear, that a Coach &amp; six is just
					stop'd at Christ-church Gates, &amp; desires to speak with you, with a huddle of things in it, as
					different as ever met together in Noah's Ark; a fat one, and a lean one, and one, that can say a little with his mouth, &amp; a great
					deal with his pen; &amp; one that can neither speak, nor write; but you'll see 'em; joy be with you; I hope too, I shall shortly see
					you; at least in congratulatione Oxoniensi: my dear West, I more than ever regret you; it would be the
					greatest of pleasures to me, to know wht you do, wht you read, how you spend your time, &amp;c: &amp;c: &amp; to tell you wht I do not
					do, not read, &amp; how I do not, &amp;c: &amp;c: for almost all the employment of my hours may be best explained by Negatives; take my
					word &amp; experience upon it, doing nothing is a most amusing business, &amp; yet neither Something, nor nothing give me any pleasure;
					for this little while last past, I have been playing with Statius; we yesterday had a game at Quoits together, you'll easily forgive me
					for having broke his head, as you have a little Pique to him</p>
         <q>
            <p>E LIB: 6to THEBAIDOS<lb/> Then thus the King, 'whoe'er the Quoit
						can wield,<lb/> And furthest send its weight athwart the field; <lb/> Let him stand forth his brawny arm to boast.' <lb/> Swift at
						the word, from out the gazing host <lb/> Young Pterelas with strength unequal drew <lb/> Labouring the Disc, &amp; to small distance
						threw: <lb/> The Band around admire the mighty Mass, <lb/> A slipp'ry weight, &amp; form'd of polish'd Brass; <lb/> The love of
						honour bad two Youths advance, <lb/> Achaians born, to try the glorious chance; <lb/> A third arose, of Acarnania he, <lb/> Of Pisa
						one, &amp; three from Ephyre; <lb/> Nor more for now Nesimachus's Son,<lb/> By Acclamations roused,
						came towring on; <lb/> Another Orb upheaved his strong right hand, <lb/> Then thus, Ye Argive flower, ye warlike band, <lb/> Who
						trust your arms shall rase the Tyrian towers, <lb/> And batter Cadmus' Walls with stony Showers, <lb/> Receive a worthier load; yon
						puny Ball <lb/> Let Youngsters toss: <lb/> He said, &amp; scornful flung th' unheeded weight <lb/> Aloof; the champions trembling
						at the sight <lb/> Prevent disgrace, the palm despair'd resign; <lb/> All, but two youths, th' enormous Orb decline, <lb/> These
						conscious Shame withheld, &amp; pride of noble line: <lb/> As bright &amp; huge the spatious circle lay <lb/> With doubled light it
						beam'd against the Day; <lb/> So glittering shews the Thracian Godheads shield, <lb/> With such a gleam affrights PangÃ¦a's field,
						<lb/> When blazing 'gainst the Sun it shines from far, <lb/> And clash'd rebellows with the Din of war: </p>
            <p>Phlegyas the long-expected play began, <lb/> Summon'd his strength, &amp; call'd forth all the Man; <lb/> All eyes were bent on
						his experienced hand, <lb/> For oft in Pisa's sports his native land <lb/> Admired that arm, oft on Alpheus' Shore<lb/> The
						pond'rous brass in exercise he bore; <lb/> Where flow'd the widest Stream he took his stand; <lb/> Sure flew the Disc from his
						unerring hand; <lb/> Nor stop'd till it had cut the further strand: <lb/> And now in Dust the polish'd Ball he roll'd, <lb/> Then
						grasp'd its weight, elusive of his hold; <lb/> Now fitting to his gripe, &amp; nervous Arm <lb/> Suspends the crowd with expectation
						warm; <lb/> Nor tempts he yet the plain, but hurl'd upright <lb/> Emits the mass, a prelude of his might; <lb/> Firmly he plants
						each knee, &amp; o'er his head, <lb/> Collecting all his force, the circle sped; <lb/> It towers to cut the clouds; now thro' the
						Skies <lb/> Sings in its rapid way, &amp; strengthens, as it flies; <lb/> Anon with slack'ned rage comes quivering down, <lb/>
						Heavy &amp; huge, &amp; cleaves the solid ground. </p>
            <p>So from th'astonish'd Stars, her nightly train, <lb/> The Sun's pale sister, drawn by magic strain, <lb/> Deserts precipitant
							[her] darken'd Sphere;<lb/> In vain the Nations [wi]th officious
						fear<lb/> Their cymbals toss, &amp; sounding brass explore; <lb/> Th' Ã&#x86;monian Hag enjoys her dreadful hour, <lb/> And smiles
						malignant on the labouring Power. </p>
         </q>
         <p>I wont plague you too much, &amp; so break the affair in the middle, &amp; give you leave to resume your Aristotle, instead of </p>
