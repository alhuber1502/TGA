      <p>How did we know, pray? No Body here remember'd another Burying of the Kind: shall
         be proud of your Advice the next opportunity, which (we hope) will be some Forty years
         hence. I am sorry you would not send for me last Night. I shall not be able to wait
         on you chez vous, so soon as I would wish, for I go in a few Days to Town, when I
         shall see Mr Walpole.
