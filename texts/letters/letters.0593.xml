					       <dateline>Cambridge, April 12, 1770. </dateline>
				     </opener>
				     <p>Never did I feel, my dear Bonstetten, to what a tedious length the few short moments of our life may be extended by impatience and
					expectation, till you had left me: nor ever knew before with so strong a conviction how much this frail body sympathizes with the
					inquietude of the mind. I am grown old in the compass of less than three weeks, like the Sultan in the Turkish Tales, that did but
					plunge his head into a vessel of water and take it out again (as the standers-by affirm'd) at the command of a Dervish, and found he
					had pass'd many years in captivity and begot a large family of children. The strength and spirits
					that now enable me to write to you, are only owing to your last letter, a temporary gleam of sunshine. Heaven knows, when it may shine
					again! I did not conceive till now (I own) what it was to lose you, nor felt the solitude and insipidity of my own condition, before I
					possess'd the happiness of your friendship.</p>
				     <p>I must cite another Greek writer to you, because it is very much to my purpose. He is describing
					the character of a Genius truly inclined to Philosophy. It includes (he says) qualifications rarely united in one single mind,
					quickness of apprehension and a retentive memory; vivacity and application, gentleness and magnanimity: to these he adds an invincible
					love of truth, and consequently of probity and justice. Such a soul (continues he) will be little inclined to sensual pleasures, and
					consequently temperate; a stranger to illiberality and avarice being accustom'd to the most extensive views of things and sublimest
					contemplations, it will contract an habitual greatness, will look down with a kind of disregard on human life and on death,
					consequently will possess the truest fortitude. Such (says he) is the Mind born to govern the rest of Mankind. But these very
					endowments so necessary to a soul form'd for philosophy are often the ruin of it (especially when join'd to the external advantages of
					wealth, nobility, strength and beauty) that is, if it light on a bad soil; and want its proper nurture, which nothing but an excellent
					education can bestow. In this case he is depraved by the publick example, the assemblies of the people, the courts of justice, the
					theatres, that inspire it with false opinions, terrify it with false infamy, or elevate it with false applause: and remember, that
					extraordinary vices and extraordinary virtues are alike the produce of a vigorous Mind: little souls are alike incapable of the one or
					the other. </p>
				     <p>If you have ever met with the portrait sketch'd out by Plato, you will know it again: for my part (to my sorrow) I have had that
					happiness: I see the principal features, and I foresee the dangers with a trembling anxiety. But enough of this, I return to your
					letter: it proves at least, that in the midst of your new gaieties, I still hold some place in your memory, and (what pleases me above
					all) it has an air of undissembled sincerity. Go on, my best and amiable Friend, to shew me your heart simply and without the shadow of
					disguise, and leave me to weep over it (as I now do) no matter whether from joy or sorrow. </p>
