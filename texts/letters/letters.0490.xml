            <salute>Dear Mr Gray </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>No, alass, she has not withstood the Severity of the Weather. It nipt her as it would have done a flower half witherd before, &amp;
					she has been this last month in a most weak condition. Yet this present fine season has enabled me to get her three or four times out
					into the air, &amp; it seems to have had some good effect, yet not enough to give me any substantial hopes of her recovery. There are few Men in the world that can have a competent Idea of what I have of late felt, &amp; still feel,
					yet you are one of those few, &amp; I am sure will give me a full share of your pity. Was I to advise Stonehewer to a Wife it should
					certainly be to a fine Lady, It should not be to one he could Love to the same degree that I do this gentle this innocent creature.</p>
         <p>I hope she will be well enough to see Mr Brown when he comesâ€“pray tell him we have changd our Lodgings &amp; are to be found
					at Mr Mennis's a Taylor at the Golden Ball in Cleveland row the last door but one nearest the green park Wall. Would to God he would
					persuade you to come with him. </p>
         <p>If I had spirits for it, I would congratulate You on the New Bishop of Cloyne. Is it not think you
					according to the order of things, I mean not the general but the peculiar order of our own times, That the Mitre wch so lately was on
					the Brows of the Man with every Virtue under heavn should now adorn those of our <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> Frederic?</p>
         <p>I think it probable that the Swelling You complain of in your throat is owing to some little swelling in a Gland. I had a complaint
					of the same kind a great while &amp; after I used myself first to a flannel round my neck at Night &amp; afterwards constantly lying in
					my stock the disorder left me. I wish you would try the same method, if you have not tryd it already.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Dear Mr Gray beleive me to be, <lb/> Yours most cordially </salute>
