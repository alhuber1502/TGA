            <salute>Dear Sr </salute>

         <p>The inclosed came a few days after you left us, as I apprehend, from Temple. I continue here much
					against my will. the gout is gone, the feverish disorder abated, but not cured; my spirits much oppress'd, &amp; the more so, as I
					foresee a new complaint, that may tie me down perhaps to my bed, &amp; expose me to the operations of a Surgeon. God knows, what will
					be the end of it.</p>
         <p>It will be an alleviation to my miseries, if I can hear, you are well, &amp; capable of enjoying those objects of curiosity, that the
					countries you are in promise to afford you. the greater the detail you give me of them, the happier I
					shall be. Mr. Clarke call'd on me yesterday, &amp; desires to be remember'd. I know nothing new here,
					but that Mr. T: Pitt is going to be married to a Miss Wilkinson, the daughter of a rich Merchant, who
					gives her 30,000Â£ down, &amp; at least as much more in expectation.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu! I am faithfully<lb/> Yours </salute>
