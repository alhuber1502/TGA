         <p>Dear Mason I was just leaving Cambridge at the time, when I received your last letter, &amp; have
					been unfix'd &amp; flitting about almost eversince, or you had heard of me sooner. you do not think I could stay to receive Fobus. no
					more did Mr. H: he was gone into Leicestershire long before; as to
					Uncle B: pray do him justice. he stay'd indeed to preach the Commencement-Sermon, but he assured me
					(in secret) it was an old one, &amp; had not one word in it <hi rend="italic">to the purpose.</hi> the very next morning he set out for
						Winchester, &amp; I do really think him much improved since he had his residence there, freer &amp;
					more open, &amp; his heart less set upon the Mammon of unrighteousness. a-propos, would you think it, Fobus has wit. he told Y: (who was invited to supper at Dr L:s, &amp; made all the company wait for
					him), 'Why, Y:e, you make but an aukward figure, now you are a Bp; this time last year you would have been the first man here.'</p>
         <p>I can not brag of my spirits, my situation, my employments, or my fertility. the days &amp; the nights pass, &amp; I am never the
					nearer to any thing but that one, to wch we are all tending. yet I love People, that leave some traces of their journey behind them,
					&amp; have strength enough to advise you to do so, while you can. I expect to see Caractacus compleated, not so much from the opinion I
					entertain of your industry, as from the consideration that another winter approaches, which is the season of harvest to an Author; but
					I will conceal the secret of your motives, &amp; join in the common applause. the books you enquire after are not worth your knowledge.
						Parnell is the dunghill of Irish-Grubstreet. I did hear, who L:t Temple was, but have really forgot: I know, I thought it was Mr Greville. Avon is nothing but a Type. the Dss of Queensberry's Advertisement has moved my
					impatience, yet after all perhaps she may curl her grey hair with her Grandfather's golden periods.
					another object of my wishes is the K: of Prussia's Account of the Campaign, wch Niphausen talk'd of 6 weeks ago, as just coming over, but it is not come: perhaps he waits for a better Catastrophe.
					the Twickenham-Press is in labour of two or three works (not of the Printer's own) one of them is an
					Account of Russia by a Lord Whitworth, who (I think) was Minister there from King William.
				</p>
         <p>I seem to have told you all I know, wch you will think very little, but <hi rend="italic">a nihilo nil fit.</hi> if I were to coin my
					whole mind into phrases, they would profit you nothing, nor fill a moderate page: compassionate my poverty, shew yourself noble in
					giving me better than I bring, &amp; ever believe me</p>

            <p>I find you miss'd of St: by going to Sr C: D'arcy's. can you tell
						me, if he is still at Harrowgate, for I do not know how to direct to him there. </p>
