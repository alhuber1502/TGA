         way to be well, am like to be confined some days longer: whatever you will send me
         that is new, or old, and <span style="font-style:italic">long,</span> will be received as a charity. Rousseau's people<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> do not interest me; there is but one character and one style in them all, I do not
         know their faces asunder. I have no esteem for their persons or conduct, am not touched
         with their passions; and as to their story, I do not believe a word of it â€“ not because
         it is improbable, but because it is absurd. If I had any little propensity, it was
         to Julie; but now she has gone and (so hand over head) married that monsieur de Wolmar,
         I take her for a <span style="font-style:italic">vraie Suissesse,</span> and do not doubt but she had taken a cup too much, like her lover.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> All this does not imply that I will not read it out, when you can spare the rest
         of it.
