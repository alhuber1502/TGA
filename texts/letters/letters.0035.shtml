      <p>Here am I, a little happy to think, I sha'nt take Degree's; and really, now I know
         there is no occasion, I don't know but I may read a little Philosophy; it is sufficient
         to make a thing agreeable, not to have much need of it: such is my humour, but let
         that pass: West sup'd with me the night before I came out of town; we both fancied
         at first, we had a great many things to say to one another; but when it came to the
         push, I found, I had forgot all I intended to say, &amp; he stood upon Punctilio's and
         would not speak first, &amp; so we parted: Cole<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been examined by the Proctors, &amp; took Bachelour's degree's, in order (he says)
         when he is Master of Arts, to assist a friend with his Vote &amp; Interest; he told me
         he would not be puzzled in Philosophy, because he would not expose himself, but desired
         to be examined in Classicks, which he understood: he still talks of having his Leg
         cut off, &amp; then being married: I have not seen Ashton; he is at St Ive's, &amp; I don't
         know when he comes back; Berkly<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> makes a Speech the 5th of November; I am,</p>
