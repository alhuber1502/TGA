				     <p>I am now settled in my new territories commanding Bedford gardens, and all the fields as far as Highgate and Hampstead, with such a
					concourse of moving pictures as would astonish you; so <hi rend="italic">rus-in-urbe-ish,</hi> that I believe I shall stay here, except
					little excursions and vagaries, for a year to come. What tho' I am separated from the fashionable world by broad St. Giles's, and many
					a dirty court and alley, yet here is air, and sunshine, and quiet, however, to comfort you: I shall confess that I am basking with heat
					all the summer, and I suppose shall be blowed down all the winter, besides being robbed every night; I trust, however, that the Musæum,
					with all its manuscripts and rarities by the cart-load, will make ample amends for all the aforesaid inconveniences.</p>
				     <p>[I this day past through the jaws of the great leviathan into the den of Dr. Templeman, superintendant of the reading-room, who
					congratulated himself on the sight of so much good company. We were, first, a man that writes for Lord Royston; 2dly, a man that writes
					for Dr. Burton, of York; 3dly, a man that writes for the Emperor of Germany, or Dr. Pocock, for he speaks the worst English I ever
					heard; 4thly, Dr. Stukely, who writes for himself, the very worst person he could write for; and, lastly, I, who only read to know if
					there be any thing worth writing, and that not without some difficulty. I find that they printed 1000 copies of the Harleian Catalogue,
					and have sold only fourscore; that they have 900£ a year income, and spend 1300, and are building apartments for the under-keepers; so
					I expect in winter to see the collection advertised and set to auction. </p>
				     <p>Have you read Lord Clarendon's Continuation of his History? Do you remember Mr. [ ]'s account of it before it came out? How well he recollected all the faults, and how utterly he forgot all the
					beauties: Surely the grossest taste is better than such a sort of delicacy.]</p>
