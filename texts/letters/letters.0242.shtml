         <p>ADVICE OF Dr OLIVER TO Sr JOHN COPE ON HIS GETTING ST ANTONY'S FIRE BY DRINKING THE
            BATH WATERS OUT OF MISS MOLLY'S HAND.
         </p> 
         <p>BY LORD BATH.</p> 
         <p>See gentle Cope with gout and love opprest, <br /> Alternate torments raging in his breast, <br /> Tries at his cure, but tampers still in vain; <br /> What lessens one, augments the other pain. <br /> The charming Nymph, who strives to give relief, <br /> Instead of comfort, heightens all his grief: <br /> For health he drinks, then sighs for love, &amp; cries, <br /> Health's in her hand, destruction in her eyes. <br /> She gives us water, but each touch alas! <br /> The wanton Girl electrifies the glass. <br /> To cure the gout, we drink large draughts of Love, <br /> And then, like Ætna, burst in flames above. <br /><br /> The Advice <br /> Sip not, dear Knight, the Daughter's liquid fire, <br /> But take the healing bev'rage from the Sire: <br /> Twill ease thy gout – for Love no cure is known; <br /> The God of physic coud not cure his own.

         <p>ON LD DARL —'s BEING MADE JOINT PAYMASTER.</p> 
         <p>Wonders, Newcastle, mark thy ev'ry hour;<br /> But this last Act's a plenitude of pow'r: <br /> Nought but the force of an almighty reign <br /> Coud make a <span style="font-style:italic">Paymaster</span> of Harry V—.
         </p> 
         <p>ON SPLITTING THE PAY OFFICE. </p> 
         <p>Holles, not past his childhood yet, retains<br /> The maxims of his Nurse or Tutor's pains: <br /> Thence did the mighty Babe this truth derive, <br /> Two negatives make one affirmative: <br /> But ah! Two Dunces never made a Wit, <br /> Nor can two Darlingtons compose a Pitt.

      <p>To draw poetry from you, I send you these mediocre verses, the only ones in fashion.
         the first lines indeed are pretty, when one considers they were writ by a Man of seventy,
         Lord Bath. the first Epigram was a thought of George Selwyn, rhimed; the last is scarce
         a thought at all.
      </p>
      <p>Ministers, Patriots, Wits, poets, paymasters, all are dispersed &amp; gone out of town.
         The Changes are made, &amp; all preferments given away: you will be glad to hear that
         our Colonel Montagu has got a regiment. Lord Waldgrave last night hearing them talk
         over these histories, said with a melancholy tone, alas! they talk so much of giving
         places for life, I wish they dont give me mine for life!
