				     <p>I had been absent from this Place a few Days, &amp; at my Return found Cibber's Book upon my Table:
					I return you my Thanks for it, &amp; have already run over a considerable Part, for who could resist Mrs LÃ¦titia Pilkington's Recommendation? (by the Way is there any such Gentlewoman, or has somebody put on the Style of a
					scribbleing Woman's Panegyric to deceive &amp; laugh at Colley?) he seems to me full as pert &amp; as dull as usual. there are whole
					Pages of Common-Place Stuff, that for Stupidity might have been wrote by Dr Waterland or any other
					grave Divine, did not the flirting saucy Phrase give them at a Distance an Air of Youth &amp; Gayety. it is very true, he is often in
					the right with regard to Tully's Weaknesses; but was there any one that did not see them? those, I imagine, that would find a Man after
					God's own Heart, are no more likely to trust the Doctor's Recommendation, than the Player's. &amp; as to Reason &amp; Truth: would they
					know their own Faces, do you think? if they look'd in the Glass, &amp; saw themselves so bedizen'd in tatter'd Fringe &amp; tarnish'd
					Lace, in French Jewels, &amp; dirty Furbelows, the frippery of a Stroller's Wardrobe? </p>
				     <p>Litterature (to take it in its most comprehensive Sense, &amp; include every Thing, that requires Invention, or Judgement, or barely
					Application &amp; Industry) seems indeed drawing apace to its Dissolution; &amp; remarkably since the Beginning of the War. I should be
					glad to know why, if any one will tell me. for I believe there may be natural Reasons discoverable enough without haveing Recourse to
					St John, or St Alexander's Revelations. I remember to have read Mr Spence's pretty Book, tho' (as he then had not been at Rome for the last Time) it must have increased greatly since that in Bulk.
					if you ask me what I read; I protest I don't remember one Syllable; but only in general, that they were the best-bred Sort of Men in
					the World, just the Kind of <hi rend="italic">Frinds</hi> one would wish to meet in a fine Summer's Evening, if one wish'd to meet any
					at all. the Heads &amp; Tails of the Dialogues, publish'd separate in 16mo, would make the sweetest Reading in Natiur for young
					Gentlemen of Family &amp; Fortune, that are learning to dance: I am told, he has put his little Picture before it. I rejoyce to hear, there is such a Crowd of dramatical Performances comeing upon the Stage.
						Agripp:na can stay very well, she thanks you; &amp; be damn'd at Leisure: I hope in God you have not
					mention'd, or shew'd to any Body that Scene (for trusting in it's Badness, I forgot to caution you concerning it) but I heard the other
					Day, that I was writeing a Play, &amp; was told the Name of it, wch no body here could know, I'm sure. the Employment you propose to
					me, much better suits my Inclination. but I much fear our Joynt-Stock would hardly compose a small Volume: what I have, is less considerable than you would imagine; &amp; of that little we should not be willing to
					publish all. there is an Epistle, ad Amicos (that is, to us all at Cambridge) in English, of above
					fourscore Lines: the Thoughts are taken from Tibullus, &amp; from a Letter of Mr Pope's in Prose. it begins</p>
				     <q>
					       <p>While You, where Camus rolls his sedgy Tide &amp;c: </p>
				     </q>
				     <p>2. An Imitation of Horace, Trojani belli scriptorem &amp;c: about 120 Lines, wrote to me.
					begins</p>
				     <q>
					       <p>While haply You (or haply not at all) <lb/> Hear the grave Pleadings in the Lawyer's Hall &amp;c: </p>
				     </q>
				     <p>3. A Translation from Propertius. L: 3. El. 15 ... 50 Lines. begins .. (sent to me at Rheims)</p>
				     <q>
					       <p>Now prostrate, Bacchus, at thy Shrine I bend &amp;c: </p>
				     </q>
				     <p>4. An Elegy, Latin. 34 Lines. begins, Quod mihi tam gratÃ¦ &amp;c:</p>
				     <p>5. Another, sent to Florence. 36 Lines.âErgo desidiÃ¦ videor &amp;c:</p>
				     <p>6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Translation from Posidippus, an Epigram .. Some Lines; on the hard
						Winter: long Verse .. on himself, a little before his Death. long
					Verse. 2 Imitations of Catullus' Basia. English. a little Ode of 5 Stanza's, to the Spring.
				</p>
				     <p>This is all I can any where find. You, I imagine, may have a good deal more. I should not care, how
					unwise the ordinary Sort of Readers might think my Affection for him provided those few, that ever loved any Body, or judged of any
					thing rightly, might from such little Remains be moved to consider, what he would have been; &amp; to wish, that Heaven had granted him
					a longer Life, &amp; a Mind more at Ease. I can't help fancying, that if you could find out Mrs West, &amp; ask her for his Papers of
					that kind (Ashton might do it in your Name) she would be ready enough to part with them, &amp; we might find something more: at least
					it would be worth while to try; for she had 'em in a great Box altogether, I well know. </p>
				     <p>I send you a few Lines, tho' Latin (wch you don't like) for the sake of the Subject. it makes Part of a large Design, &amp; is the Beginning of the fourth Book, wch was intended to treat of the Passions. excuse the 3 first
					Verses: you know Vanity (with the Romans) is a poetical License.</p>
