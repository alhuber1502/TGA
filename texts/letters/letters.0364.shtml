         <div class="salute">Dear Sir </div>
      </div>
      <p>I guess what the packet is, and desire you would keep it, for I am come back hither,
         and hope to be with you on Tuesday night. I shall trouble you to have my bed aired,
         and to speak about a lodging for my servant; though (if it be not contrary to the
         etiquette of the college) I should rather hope there might be some garret vacant this
         summer time, and that he might lie within your walls; but this I leave to your consideration.
      </p>
      <p>This very night Billy Robinson consummates his good fortune; she has £10,000 in her
         pocket, and a brother unmarried with at least as much more. He is infirm, and the
         first convoy that sails they all three set out together for Naples to pass a year
         or two. I insist upon it he owes all this to Mr. Talbot in the first place, and in
         the second to me, and have insisted on a couple of thousand pounds between us–the
         least penny–or he is a shabby fellow.
      </p>
      <p>I ask pardon about Madame de Fuentes and her twelve ladies. I heard it in good company,
         when first she arrived, piping hot; and I suppose it was rather what people apprehended
         than what they experienced. She surely brought them over, but I do not find she has
         carried them about; on the contrary, she calls on my Lady Hervey in a morning in an
         undress, and desires to be without ceremony; and the whole tribe, except Madame de
         Mora (the young countess), were at Miss Chudleigh's ball and many other places: but
         of late D'Abreu (whom nobody ever liked) has advised them to be disagreeable, and
         they accept of no invitations.
      </p>
      <p>Adieu, dear sir; I hope so soon to be with you, that I may spare you the trouble of
         reading any more.–

         <p>I hear there was a quarrel at the [Commenc:t] between Dr. Barnard and Dr. Ogden –mackerel
