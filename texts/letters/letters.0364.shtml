         <div class="salute">Dear Sir </div>
      </div>
      <p>I guess what the packet<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is, and desire you would keep it, for I am come back hither,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and hope to be with you on Tuesday<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> night. I shall trouble you to have my bed aired, and to speak about a lodging for
         my servant; though (if it be not contrary to the etiquette of the college) I should
         rather hope there might be some garret vacant this summer time, and that he might
         lie within your walls; but this I leave to your consideration.</p>
      <p>This very night Billy Robinson<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> consummates his good fortune; she has £10,000 in her pocket, and a brother unmarried
         with at least as much more. He is infirm, and the first convoy that sails they all
         three set out together for Naples to pass a year or two. I insist upon it he owes
         all this to Mr. Talbot<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in the first place, and in the second to me, and have insisted on a couple of thousand
         pounds between us–the least penny–or he is a shabby fellow.</p>
      <p>I ask pardon about Madame de Fuentes<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and her twelve ladies. I heard it in good company, when first she arrived, piping
         hot; and I suppose it was rather what people apprehended than what they experienced.
         She surely brought them over, but I do not find she has carried them about; on the
         contrary, she calls on my Lady Hervey<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in a morning in an undress, and desires to be without ceremony; and the whole tribe,
         except Madame de Mora<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (the young countess), were at Miss Chudleigh's ball<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and many other places: but of late D'Abreu<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (whom nobody ever liked) has advised them to be disagreeable, and they accept of
         no invitations.</p>
      <p>Adieu, dear sir; I hope so soon to be with you, that I may spare you the trouble of
         reading any more.– </p>
