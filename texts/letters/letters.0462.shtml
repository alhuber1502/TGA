         <div class="salute">Dear Mr Gray</div>
      </div>
      <p>As bad as Your Verses<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> were, they are Yours, &amp; therefore when I get back to York Ill paste them carefully
         in the first page of My Shakespeare to inhance its Value for I intend it to be put
         in My Marriage Settlement as a Provision for my Younger Daughters. My Eldest Boy is
         to be provided for out of Huttons Nose<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; I have just now writ to Stonehewer to get a reversionary grant of a Commission
         of Hawkers &amp; Pedlars for my second Son. When this matter is settled I hope soon to
         be in possession of My gentle Argentile.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> For really &amp; sincerely I have seen her, got her Consent<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> have written to her Father &amp; Letters now pass evry Post relative to her Jointure.
         After all I verily beleive it wont do. And am at present much out of sorts about it.
         and was it not that I love her more than ever, should wish I had been soused Head
         &amp; Ears at Hartlepool e'er I had ventured to make my proposals. But no more of this.
         You wont pity me now, no more than you did when I was in residence &amp; Sore Eyes.</p>
      <p>I am here about the Commission concerning My Exchange of Glebe<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch I hope to finish next Wednesday. After wch I shall go soon either to Hull or
         York unless Lord Holdernesse stops me by coming here next Week, wch tho he talks of
         doing, I fancy he will not.</p>
      <p>I know nothing of Politics<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> except from a Letter of Frasers,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that He is taken from Lord Northumberland by the Duke of Grafton &amp; is just where
         he was four years ago with Lord Holdernesse. Poor Fellow I pity him, but I hope Stonehewer<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> will be good to him for he is a worthy Creature. I have no beleif however in the
         Duration of this Ministry unless Mr Pitt adds himself to it, which I fancy hell hardly
         do.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>You will be very cross I know at this Letter, since it will tell you that I shall
         not come to Hartlepool. For I know You want somebody that you may Frump<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; scold &amp; say sharp things to. And my Dovelike temper would be n[o]thing<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in the world for you after a g[ulp]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Sea Water.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> However my Eyes are [so]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> perfectly well, that I laugh at the Scurvy.</p>
      <p>I direct this to Dr Whartons on Supposition that you are tird of Hartlepool. Give
         my best compliments to the Dr &amp; His Lady &amp; beleive me to be as much as I can be any
         bodys at present </p>
