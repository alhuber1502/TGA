         <div class="salute">Dear Sir </div>
      </div>
      <p>By this time I conclude, you are return'd to Cambridge: tho' I thought it a long time,
         before I heard of you from Thrandeston, and could have wish'd you had stay'd longer
         with Palgrave: perhaps you are in Hertfordshire, however I write at a venture. I went
         to Mr. Mann's, and (tho' he is in Town) not finding him at home, left a note with
         an account of my business with him, and my direction. I have had no message in answer
         to it: so possibly he has written to you, and sent the papers. I know not.
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Precentor is still here, and not in haste to depart, indeed I do not know whether
         he has not a fit of the Gout: it is certain, he had a pain yesterday in his foot,
         but whether owing to Bechamel and Claret, or to cutting a corn, was not determined:
         he is still at Stonhewer's house, and has not made his journey to Eton and to Bath
         yet, tho' he intends to do it.
      </p>
      <p>We have had no mobs, nor illuminations yet, since I was here. Wilkes's speech you
         have seen; the Court was so surprised at being contemn'd to its face, and in the face
         of the World, that the Chief in a manner forgot the matter in hand, and enter'd into
         an apology for his own past conduct, and so (with the rest of his Assessors) shuffled
         the matter off, and left the danger to the officers of the Crown, that is indeed,
         to the Ministry. Nobody had ventured, or would venture to serve the <span style="font-style:italic">Capias</span>  upon him. I cannot assure, it is done yet; tho' yesterday I heard it was, and (if
         so) he comes again to-day into Court. He professes himself ready to make any submissions
         to the K., but not to give up his pursuit of Ld. HI. The Delavals attend very regularly,
         and take notes of all that passes. His writ of Error on the Outlawry must come to
         a decision before the House of Lords.
      </p>
      <p>I was not among the Coal-heavers at Shadwell, tho' seven people lost their lives in
         the fray: Nor was I in Goodmans Fields where the Bawdy-house was demolish'd. The Ministry
         (I believe) are but ticklish in their situation: they talk of Grenville and his Brother,
         again. Lord forbid! it must be dreadful necessity indeed, that brings them back.
