            <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>That Mr. Brockett has broke his neck, you will have seen in the News-papers; &amp; also that I (your
					humble Servant) have kiss'd the K:s hand for his succession. they both are true, but the manner how you know not; only I can assure
					you, that I had no hand at all in his fall, &amp; <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> as little in the second happy event. he died on the
					Sunday, on Wednesday following, his Gr: of Grafton wrote me a very polite letter to say, that his Maj: had commanded him to <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> me the vacant Professorship, not only as a reward of &amp;c: but as a credit to &amp;c: with much more too
					high for me to transcribe. <hi rend="italic">You are to say,</hi> that I owe my nomination to the <hi rend="italic">whole
						Cabinet-Council,</hi> &amp; my success to the K:s <hi rend="italic">particular knowledge of me.</hi> this last he told me himself,
					tho' the day was so hot &amp; the ceremony so embarrassing to me, that I hardly know what he said.</p>
         <p>I am commission'd to make you an offer, wch, I have told him (not the King) you would not accept, long ago. Mr. Barrett (whom you know) offers to you 100Â£ a-year with meat, drink, washing, chaise, &amp; lodging, if you will
					please to accompany him thro' France into Italy. he has taken such a fancy to you, that I can not but do what he desires me, being
					pleased with him for it. I know, it will never do, tho' before you grew a rich fat Rector, I have often wish'd (ay, &amp; fish'd too)
					for such an opportunity. no matter! I desire you to write your answer to him yourself as civil, as you think fit, &amp; then let me
					know the result. that's all. He lives at <hi rend="italic">Lee near Canterbury.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Adieu! I am to perish here with heat this fortnight yet, &amp; then to Cambridge. Dr M: (Mr Vicecan:) came post hither to ask this vacant office on Wednesday last, &amp; went post to carry the
					news back on Saturday. the rest were Delaval, Lort, Peck, &amp; Jebb. as to Lort, he deserved it,
					&amp; Delaval is an honest Gentleman: the rest do me no great honor, no more than my Predecessor did: to be sure, my <hi rend="italic">Dignity</hi> is a little the worse for wear, but mended &amp; wash'd it will do for me.</p>
