         <div class="salute">Dear Doctr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I heartily rejoice with you, that your little family are out of danger, &amp; all apprehensions
         of that kind over with them for life. yet I have heard, you were ill yourself, &amp; kept
         your bed: as this was (I imagine) only by way of regimen, &amp; not from necessity; I
         hope soon to be told, you have no farther occasion for it. yet take care of yourself,
         for there is a bad fever now very frequent. it is among the boys at Eton, &amp; (I am
         told), is much spread about London too. my notion is, that your violent quick pulse,
         &amp; soapy diet would not suit well with feverish disorders. tho' our party at Slough
         turn'd out so ill, I could not help being sorry, that you were not with us.
      </p>
      <p>Have you read Mr. Hurd's (printed) Letter to Mason on the Marks of Imitation? you
         do not tell me your opinion of it. you bid me send you criticisms on myself, &amp; even
         <span style="font-style:italic">compliments.</span> did I tell you, what the Speaker says? the 2d Ode, he says, is a good pretty tale,
         but nothing to the <span style="font-style:italic">Churchyard.</span> Mr. Bedingfield in a golden shower of panegyrick writes me word, that at Yorkraces
         he overheard three People, whom by their dress &amp; manner he takes for Lords, say, that
         I was impenetrable &amp; inexplicable, and they wish'd, I had told them in prose, what
         I meant in verse, &amp; then they bought me (wch was what most displeased him) &amp; put me
         in their pocket. Dr Warburton is come to Town, &amp; likes them extremely. he says the
         World never pass'd so just an opinion upon any thing as upon them: for that in other
         things they have affected to like or dislike, whereas here they own, they do not understand,
         wch he looks upon to be very true; but yet thinks, they understand them as well as
         they do Milton or Shakespear, whom they are obliged by fashion to admire. Mr G:k's
         compliment you have seen; I am told it was printed in the Chronicle of last Saturday.
         the Review I have read, &amp; admire it, particularly that observation, that the <span style="font-style:italic">Bard</span> is taken from <span style="font-style:italic">Pastor, cum traheret,</span>  &amp; the advice to be more an <span style="font-style:italic">original,</span> &amp; in order to be so, the way is (he says) to cultivate the native flowers of the
         soil, &amp; not introduce the exoticks of another climate.
      </p>
      <p>I am greatly pleased with M:n s Caractacus in its present state. the contrivance &amp;
         arrangement of events, the manners of the country, the characters &amp; passions, strike
         me wonderfully. the difficult part is now got over, nothing remains but to polish,
         &amp; retouch a little: yet only the beginning of the first Chorus is done of the lyric
         part. have you seen it?
