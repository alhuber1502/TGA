         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>That Mr. Brockett has broke his neck, you will have seen in the News-papers; &amp; also
         that I (your humble Servant) have kiss'd the K:s hand for his succession. they both
         are true, but the manner how you know not; only I can assure you, that I had no hand
         at all in his fall, &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">almost</span> as little in the second happy event. he died on the Sunday, on Wednesday following,
         his Gr: of Grafton wrote me a very polite letter to say, that his Maj: had commanded
         him to <span style="font-style:italic">offer</span> me the vacant Professorship, not only as a reward of &amp;c: but as a credit to &amp;c: with
         much more too high for me to transcribe. <span style="font-style:italic">You are to say,</span> that I owe my nomination to the <span style="font-style:italic">whole Cabinet-Council,</span> &amp; my success to the K:s <span style="font-style:italic">particular knowledge of me.</span> this last he told me himself, tho' the day was so hot &amp; the ceremony so embarrassing
         to me, that I hardly know what he said.
      </p>
      <p>I am commission'd to make you an offer, wch, I have told him (not the King) you would
         not accept, long ago. Mr. Barrett (whom you know) offers to you 100Â£ a-year with meat,
         drink, washing, chaise, &amp; lodging, if you will please to accompany him thro' France
         into Italy. he has taken such a fancy to you, that I can not but do what he desires
         me, being pleased with him for it. I know, it will never do, tho' before you grew
         a rich fat Rector, I have often wish'd (ay, &amp; fish'd too) for such an opportunity.
         no matter! I desire you to write your answer to him yourself as civil, as you think
         fit, &amp; then let me know the result. that's all. He lives at <span style="font-style:italic">Lee near Canterbury.</span></p>
      <p>Adieu! I am to perish here with heat this fortnight yet, &amp; then to Cambridge. Dr M:
         (Mr Vicecan:) came post hither to ask this vacant office on Wednesday last, &amp; went
         post to carry the news back on Saturday. the rest were Delaval, Lort, Peck, &amp; Jebb.
         as to Lort, he deserved it, &amp; Delaval is an honest Gentleman: the rest do me no great
         honor, no more than my Predecessor did: to be sure, my <span style="font-style:italic">Dignity</span> is a little the worse for wear, but mended &amp; wash'd it will do for me.
