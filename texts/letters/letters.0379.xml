            <salute>Dear Mr Gray</salute>
         </opener>
         <p> I thank you much for your Criticisms But at present shall not take notice of them. They will stand me in good stead whenever I put
					the Elegy in my just volume and till then let them pass.</p>
         <p>I thank you also very much for Your Georgiana. if they be genuine I thank you as an Englishman; and prefer them before evry thing
					that ever ended in Ana; but you are mistaken in your Preacher, it was Dr Thomas Wilson of
					Westminster, who they say is a Rogue, the other is only a Coxcomb, but a sort of Coxcomb that I hate almost as much as a Rogue.</p>
         <p>If the nouvelle Eloise be Rousseaus, pity me because I live at Aston, &amp; have not seen it, &amp;
					be sure send me some account of it and that with speed. I find there is a new report that Ld H is to
					go to Ireland this has inducd poor Fred: Hervey (glad of such an opportunity of renewing our
					Correspondence) to write to me, &amp; to tell me that His Friends have hopes of making him first Chaplain, but that he begs first to
					know whether it will interfere with me &amp; whether it might not be made compatible with my interest, all this was so Jellied over
					with Friendship that he thought I fancy I should scarce know the Dish he presented me with. The letter I shall tye up in a Bundle with
					one of Archbishop Huttons &amp; some others wch I keep as Curiositys in their way, I have however in
					pity to his Wife &amp; family of small Children sent him an answer not so tart as he deservd, &amp;
					given him full liberty of useing all his interest in this matter. However Keep this a Secret because I promisd to do it &amp; because
					also I should not have broke my promise could I have thought of any thing better to write at present.</p>
         <p>I am glad at Heart to find this annihilation of Toryism, wch you give me an acct of. Fobus, besides Lying, had only one other
					ministerial Art in his possession wch too was a Species of Lying, And this he exerted in making evry Man who was not a friend to the
					Ministry a Tory. Was he askd to explain this? he had not skill enough in English History &amp; the constitution of his country to do
					it; &amp; therefore he explaind himself by saying a Tory was a Jacobite, &amp; a Jacobite a Tory. Thus you may remember one of his
					tools who could not cleverly make you either Tory or Jacobite said you was worse you was a Republican. May God send this measure a happy ending, &amp; may the next Generation be only distinguishd by the style &amp; title of Friends to
					their Country.</p>
         <p>You have by this time heard Elisi pray give me an account of him or it as soon as possible &amp;
					send me also your Recipe for Chevichi, in plain terms.</p>
         <p>Have you made up your mind about Gothic Architecture &amp; consequently given over Your Genealogical Studies wch it seems are so intimately connected with that Science. for my part I am metamorphosing some good Old
					Homilies into new-fashiond Sermons &amp; consequently spoiling every period of them. But what better can I do, living as I here do in
					almost absolute solitude, &amp; in that state of Life wch My old Friend Jeremy Taylor so well describes in his Sermon aptly entituled
					the Marriage ring. 'Celibate Life (sayth he) like the <hi rend="italic">Flie</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">heart of an Apple dwells in a perpetual sweetness,</hi> but sits alone, &amp; is confind, and <hi rend="italic">dies in
						singularity,</hi> but Marriage like the useful Bee builds a house gathers sweetness from evry flowr labors and unites into Societys
					&amp; republics &amp;c.' If I survive You, &amp; come to publish your Works, I shall quote this passage, from whence you so evidently
					(without ever seeing it) took that thought <hi rend="italic">Poor Moralist, and what art thou,</hi> &amp;c. But the Plagiarism had been too glaring had you taken <hi rend="italic">the heart of the Apple</hi> In wch
					however the great beauty of the thought consists. After all why will you not read Jeremy Taylor? take my word once more for it he is
					the Shakespeare of Divines.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu and beleive me to be ever most entirely yours.</salute>
