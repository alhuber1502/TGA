         <p>William Shakespeare <br /> To Mrs Anne, Regular Servant <br /> to the Revd Mr Precentor <br /> of York.
         </p> 
         <p>A MOMENT'S patience, gentle Mistris Anne! <br /> (But stint your clack for sweet St Charitie) <br /> 'Tis Willy begs, once a right proper Man, <br /> Tho' now a Book, and interleav'd, you see.
         </p> 
         <p>Much have I born from canker'd Critick's spite,<br /> From fumbling Baronets, and Poets small,<br /> Pert Barristers, &amp; Parsons nothing bright: <br /> But, what awaits me now, is worst of all!
         </p> 
         <p>'Tis true, our Master's temper natural <br /> Was fashion'd fair in meek &amp; dovelike guise:<br /> But may not honey's self be turn'd to gall <br /> By residence, by marriage, &amp; sore eyes?
         </p> 
         <p>If then he wreak on me his wicked will: <br /> Steal to his closet at the hour of prayer, <br /> And (when thou hear'st the organ piping shrill) <br /> Grease his best pen, &amp; all he scribbles, tear.
         </p> 
         <p>Better to bottom tarts &amp; cheesecakes nice, <br /> Better the roast-meat from the fire to save, <br /> Better be twisted into caps for spice, <br /> Than thus be patch'd, &amp; cobbled in one's grave!
         </p> 
         <p>So York shall taste, what ClouÃ«t never knew;<br /> So from <span style="font-style:italic">our</span> works sublimer fumes shall rise:<br /> While Nancy earns the praise to Shakespear due <br /> For glorious puddings, &amp; immortal pies.
         </p>

      <p>Tell me, if you don't like this, &amp; I will send you a worse. I rejoice to hear, your
         eyes are better as much, as if they were my own: but the cure will never be lasting
         without a little sea. I have been for two days at Hartlepool to tast the water, &amp;
         do assure you, nothing can be salter, &amp; bitterer, &amp; nastier, &amp; better for you. they
         have a most antiscorbutic flavour. I am delighted with the place: there are the finest
         walks &amp; rocks &amp; caverns, &amp; dried fishes, &amp; all manner of small inconveniences a Man
         can wish. I am going again this week to wait your commands.
      </p>
      <p>Dr Wharton would be quite happy to see you at Old-Park. if you should have kindness
         &amp; resignation enough to come, you must get to Darlington, then turn off the great
         road to Merrington, then enquire the way to Spenny-more House, where they will direct
         you hither.
