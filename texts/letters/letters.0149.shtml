      <p>I had been absent from this Place a few Days, &amp; at my Return found Cibber's Book upon
         my Table: I return you my Thanks for it, &amp; have already run over a considerable Part,
         for who could resist Mrs Lætitia Pilkington's Recommendation? (by the Way is there
         any such Gentlewoman, or has somebody put on the Style of a scribbleing Woman's Panegyric
         to deceive &amp; laugh at Colley?) he seems to me full as pert &amp; as dull as usual. there
         are whole Pages of Common-Place Stuff, that for Stupidity might have been wrote by
         Dr Waterland or any other grave Divine, did not the flirting saucy Phrase give them
         at a Distance an Air of Youth &amp; Gayety. it is very true, he is often in the right
         with regard to Tully's Weaknesses; but was there any one that did not see them? those,
         I imagine, that would find a Man after God's own Heart, are no more likely to trust
         the Doctor's Recommendation, than the Player's. &amp; as to Reason &amp; Truth: would they
         know their own Faces, do you think? if they look'd in the Glass, &amp; saw themselves
         so bedizen'd in tatter'd Fringe &amp; tarnish'd Lace, in French Jewels, &amp; dirty Furbelows,
         the frippery of a Stroller's Wardrobe?
      </p>
      <p>Litterature (to take it in its most comprehensive Sense, &amp; include every Thing, that
         requires Invention, or Judgement, or barely Application &amp; Industry) seems indeed drawing
         apace to its Dissolution; &amp; remarkably since the Beginning of the War. I should be
         glad to know why, if any one will tell me. for I believe there may be natural Reasons
         discoverable enough without haveing Recourse to St John, or St Alexander's Revelations.
         I remember to have read Mr Spence's pretty Book, tho' (as he then had not been at
         Rome for the last Time) it must have increased greatly since that in Bulk. if you
         ask me what I read; I protest I don't remember one Syllable; but only in general,
         that they were the best-bred Sort of Men in the World, just the Kind of <span style="font-style:italic">Frinds</span> one would wish to meet in a fine Summer's Evening, if one wish'd to meet any at all.
         the Heads &amp; Tails of the Dialogues, publish'd separate in 16mo, would make the sweetest
         Reading in Natiur for young Gentlemen of Family &amp; Fortune, that are learning to dance:
         I am told, he has put his little Picture before it. I rejoyce to hear, there is such
         a Crowd of dramatical Performances comeing upon the Stage. Agripp:na can stay very
         well, she thanks you; &amp; be damn'd at Leisure: I hope in God you have not mention'd,
         or shew'd to any Body that Scene (for trusting in it's Badness, I forgot to caution
         you concerning it) but I heard the other Day, that I was writeing a Play, &amp; was told
         the Name of it, wch no body here could know, I'm sure. the Employment you propose
         to me, much better suits my Inclination. but I much fear our Joynt-Stock would hardly
         compose a small Volume: what I have, is less considerable than you would imagine;
         &amp; of that little we should not be willing to publish all. there is an Epistle, ad
         Amicos (that is, to us all at Cambridge) in English, of above fourscore Lines: the
         Thoughts are taken from Tibullus, &amp; from a Letter of Mr Pope's in Prose. it begins

      <p>This is all I can any where find. You, I imagine, may have a good deal more. I should
         not care, how unwise the ordinary Sort of Readers might think my Affection for him
         provided those few, that ever loved any Body, or judged of any thing rightly, might
         from such little Remains be moved to consider, what he would have been; &amp; to wish,
         that Heaven had granted him a longer Life, &amp; a Mind more at Ease. I can't help fancying,
         that if you could find out Mrs West, &amp; ask her for his Papers of that kind (Ashton
         might do it in your Name) she would be ready enough to part with them, &amp; we might
         find something more: at least it would be worth while to try; for she had 'em in a
         great Box altogether, I well know.

      <p>I send you a few Lines, tho' Latin (wch you don't like) for the sake of the Subject.
         it makes Part of a large Design, &amp; is the Beginning of the fourth Book, wch was intended
         to treat of the Passions. excuse the 3 first Verses: you know Vanity (with the Romans)
         is a poetical License.
