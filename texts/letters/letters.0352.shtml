         <div class="salute">Dear Mary </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am not dead, as you probably imagine, but have been employ'd in seeing the gradual
         approaches of death in poor Lady Cobham, whom I went to see at Stoke, &amp; in whose house
         I have continued at her own desire, after she came to Town for farther advice, till
         the last week. affairs of my own obliged me to come home to Southampton-Row. I have
         left her growi[ng] daily worse &amp; worse, &amp; in a way (I think) ab[solute]ly hopeless.
         what I have been saying is m[erely] as somewhat of an excuse for not having [soo]ner
         answer'd your last letter. your dear A[unt  is] upon the point of setting out for
         Hadham, &amp; only stays till the Lottery has done drawing. I hope you will be very good
         Neighbours, &amp; pray, don't be sparing of your bottled Beer.
      </p>
      <p>I am very well satisfied with my new place of abode here. my fatigue of furnishing
         was soon over, for I have no furniture at all but a bed to lie on, half of w<span class="super">ch</span> is much at your service. pray come, &amp; we'll go every night to the Play, Tuesdays
         &amp; Saturdays excepted, when there are Operas. the old Chintz-Chairs &amp; Settee cut a
         figure here, but are mightily at a loss for want of curtains. what must I do? you
         know, I have but one Pair, w<span class="super">ch</span> will do to cover a Sofa, or two Great Chairs. now here are three Windows to be provided
         for. is it possible to get a Linnen approaching to the colours &amp; pattern of the Chintz;
         or will it be absurd to put up some silky thing of a plain green suppose, or some
         uniform colour &amp; a deep fringe, in the same room with the Chairs? do, advise me.
      </p>
      <p>I rejoice in the Lye-lye, &amp; snuff up the Idea of it. it is delicious, whenever you
         please to send it: but I insist at the same time in being told exactly, what it stood
         you in. as to the trouble it has given you, for that I must remain your Debtor, &amp;
         for many other articles. but do, come to see me, <span class="hi">for you are like none of the Family!</span></p>
      <p>My Compliments to your Mamma, &amp; [lov]e to our Dolly.</p>
