      <p>It is doubtless highly reasonable, that two young Foreigners come into so distant
         a Country to acquaint themselves with strange Things should have some Time allowed
         them to take a View of the King (God bless him) &amp; the Ministry, &amp; the Theatres, &amp;
         Westminster Abbey &amp; the Lyons,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; such other Curiosities of the Capital City: you civilly call them Dissipations;
         but to me they appear Employments of a very serious Nature, as they enlarge the Mind,
         give a great Insight into the Nature &amp; Genius of a People, keep the Spirits in an
         agreeable Agitation, and (like the True Artificial Spirit of Lavender) amazingly fortify
         &amp; corroborate the whole nervous System. but as all Things sooner or later must pass
         away, &amp; there is a certain Period, when (by the Rules of Proportion) one is to grow
         weary of every Thing: I may hope at length a Season will arrive, when you will be
         tired of forgetting me. 'tis true you have a long Journey to make first, a vast Series
         of Sights to pass thro'. let me see! you are at Lady Brown<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> already. I have set a Time, when I may say, oh! he is now got to the Waxwork in Fleetstreet:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there is nothing more but Cupid's Paradise,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the Hermaphrodite from Guinea, &amp; the Original Basilisk Dragon, &amp; the Buffalo from
         Babylon, &amp; the New Chimpanzee,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; then I. have a Care, you had best, that I come in my Turn: you know in whose Hands
         I have deposited my little Interests. I shall infallibly appeal to my <span style="font-style:italic">best invisible</span> Friend<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in the Country.</p>
      <p>I am glad Castalio<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has justified himself &amp; me to You. he seem'd to me more made for Tenderness, than
         Horrour, &amp; (I have Courage again to insist upon it) might make a better Player than
         any now on the Stage. I have not alone received (thank you) but almost got thro' Louis
         Onze.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> 'tis very well, methinks, but nothing particular. what occasion'd his Castration<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Paris, I imagine, were certain Strokes in Defence of the Gallican Church &amp; its
         Liberties–a little Contempt cast upon the Popes, &amp; something here &amp; there on the Conduct
         of the great Princes. there are a few Instances of Malice against our Nation, that
         are very foolish.</p>
      <p>My Companion,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whom you salute, is (much to my Sorrow) only so now &amp; then. he lives 20 Miles off
         at Nurse, &amp; is not so meagre as when you first knew him, but of a reasonable Plumposity.
         he shall not fail being here to do the Honours, when you make your publick Entry.
         heigh-ho! when that will be, chi sá? but, mi lusinga il dolce sogno!–I love Mr Whithed,
         &amp; wish him all Happiness.</p>
