      <p>It is a misfortune to me to be at a distance from both of you at present.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> A letter can give one so little idea of such matters! [ ] I always believed well
         of his heart and temper, and would gladly do so still. If they are as they should
         be, I should have expected every thing from such an explanation; for it is a tenet
         with me (a simple one, you'll perhaps say), that if ever two people, who love one
         another, come to breaking, it is for want of a timely eclaircissement, a full and
         precise one, without witnesses or mediators, and without reserving any one disagreeable
         circumstance for the mind to brood upon in silence.</p>
      <p>I am not totally of your mind as to Mr. Lyttleton's Elegy,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> though I love kids and fawns<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as little as you do. If it were all like the fourth stanza,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I should be excessively pleased. Nature and sorrow, and tenderness, are the true
         genius of such things; and something of these I find in several parts of it (not in
         the orange-tree):<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> poetical ornaments are foreign to the purpose; for they only show a man is not sorry;â€“and
         devotion worse; for it teaches him, that he ought not to be sorry, which is all the
         pleasure of the thing. I beg leave to turn your weathercock the contrary way. Your
         Epistle<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have not seen a great while, and doctor M.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is not in the way to give me a sight of it: but I remember enough to be sure all
         the world will be pleased with it, even with all its <span style="font-style:italic">faults upon its head,</span> if you don't care to mend them. I would try to do it myself (however hazardous),
         rather than it should remain unpublished. As to my Eton Ode,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mr. Dodsley is <span style="font-style:italic">padrone.</span> The second<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you had, I suppose you do not think worth giving him: otherwise, to me it seems not
         worse than the former. He might have Selima<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> too, unless she be of too little importance for his patriot-collection; or perhaps
         the <span style="font-style:italic">connections</span> you had with her may interfere. <span style="font-style:italic">Che so io</span>? Adieu!</p>
