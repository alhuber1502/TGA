         <div class="dateline">Bath, Nov. 27, 1769. </div>
      </div>
      <p>I have two reasons for writing, one because it seems an age to me since I heard of
         you, the other to mention that I have taken the liberty of recommending to your notice
         Mr. de Bonstetten.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have given him a letter to you, but yet I thought it best to apprise you of it,
         that he might not come an entire stranger. I picked him out from among the mob in
         the rooms here,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and like him very much; I shall be a little disappointed if you do not think him
         better than common for his age, and very little spoiled considering that he is the
         only son of the treasurer of Berne, and of one of the six noble families which bear
         the chief sway in the aristocracy. He was first at the university of Lausanne; afterwards
         his father sent for him home; then he went to Leyden, but thought Holland a most triste
         pays, and begged to be released, so he had leave to cross over to England; he seems
         to have read, and to be unwilling now to waste his time if he knew how to employ it;
         I think he is vastly better than any thing English (of the same age) I ever saw; and
         then, I have a partiality to him because he was born among mountains; and talks of
         them with enthusiasm–of the forests of pines which grow darker and darker as you ascend,
         till the <span style="font-style:italic">nemorum nox</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is completed, and you are forced to grope your way; of the cries of eagles and other
         birds of prey adding to the horror; in short, of all the wonders of his country, which
         disturb my slumbers in Lovingland.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I made Wheeler<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> acquainted with him, who likes him as well as I, and has given him letters to Mr.
         Pitt<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and to Mrs. Hay,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which have succeeded very well. When I go into Switzerland I am to be so directed!
         so recommended! and to travel with such advantages! but it is absolutely necessary
         to pass a month at Zurich to learn German; and the mountains must be traversed on
         foot; avec des Grimpons aux mains, and shoes of a peculiar construction. I'd give
         my ears to try.</p>
      <p>So, because it would have given me infinite pleasure to have heard from the banks
         of Derwent Water, and because I gave you my direction, I was not to have a single
         line! for my part I would have told you long ago how I was pleased with the country
         about Southampton, delighted with Nettley Abbey, enchanted with the Isle of Wight,
         (where I passed three days alone searching every corner) how from thence I went to
         my cousin's in Dorsetshire,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> stayed six weeks, and came hither on my cousin Fanny's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> account; how pleased we were with Stour Head!<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> how much more than pleased with Mr. Morris's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (which we saw just when Autumn had begun to tinge the woods with a thousand beautiful
         varieties of colour) and with other scenes on the Severn. All this and more I would
         have told you; and if I had been as tedious as an Emperor, I could have found in my
         heart to have bestowed it all upon you, only you took care to secure yourself by leaving
         me without a direction.</p>
      <p>We leave this place on Wednesday se'nnight and shall be in town the Saturday after.
         God knows where you are, but if in town I shall have a chance of seeing you. We shall
         depart for Blundeston the Wednesday after. </p>
      <p>This place (Bath) surprised and pleased me extremely at first. It was so new a sight
         to see a town built of hewn stone, instead of ragged and dirty brick, and streets
         and parades on a regular plan, and above all the circus, instead of the confused heap
         of buildings of all shapes and sizes which compose every other town in England. The
         neighbouring country is very pretty– hills of some height with cultivated valleys
         running among them, the principal one (which leads to Bristol) watered by the Avon.
         There are many fine trees in the hedge-rows; and some woods clothing the sides of
         the hills. I have seen Mr. Mason's monument for his wife,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and like it; but the medallion is I think too small; and the sculpture so small and
         delicate that it is seen to disadvantage at the height where it is placed.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you will believe me if I say I long to see or hear from you! indeed I do most
         devoutly. I have a heart that would be much more at home at Pembroke Hall than it
         is at Bath.</p>
