         <p>I have so little to write, &amp; so much to say; that, when you really do come, you may expect for the first fortnight to do nothing,
					but hearken to my Questions; &amp; to spend the next month in answering them: nay, I assure you, I limit the time only that you may
					rest a while, to take breath; otherwise I could listen to you for the whole two years with an infinite deal of pleasure. I am forming
					the image to myself of your journey hither; I suppose you will come down Essex way, &amp; if you do, first you must cross Epping
						forest, &amp; there you must be rob'd: then you go a long way, &amp; at last you come to Gog-magog
						hills, and then you must be overturn'd: I hope, you have not hurt yourself; but you must come at last
					to Foulmoor fields, &amp; then you must fall Squash into a bog, pray, don't be frighted, for in about
					an hour and half you may chance to get out; now perhaps if it is not dark, you m[ay see the t]op of
					King's Chappel; tho' if it should be night, it is very likely, you won't be able to see at all: however at last you get into Cambridge,
					all bemudded &amp; tired, with three wheels and a half to the coach, four horses lame, and two blind: the first thing, that appears, is
					a row of Alms-houses, &amp; presently on the right-hand you'll see a thing like two Presbyterian Meeting-houses with the backside of a
					little Church between them, &amp; here you must find out by Sympathy, that this is Peter-house, &amp; that I am but a little way off, I
					shall soon feel how near you are; then you should sayâ&#x80;&#x93;no, no, I should sayâ&#x80;&#x93;but I believe I shall be too much overjoy'd to
					say anything, well; be that, as it will, I still hope, you will be almost as much so: dear Sr, you are welcome to Cambridge; what d'ye
					think? Pilk Hale about 3 months ago had a great inclination to visit Malepert, but thought it would not be well-bred not to let him know it beforehand; &amp; being at a loss, who he
					should send; I persuaded him to go himself, &amp; let him know Mr Hale would wait upon him in the afternoon. and so he did: Mal:
					promised to return it very soon; &amp; ever since the other has staid at home with all his fine things set out to the best advantage,
					&amp; is quite sure he'll come, &amp; expects him every hour:â&#x80;&#x93; [...] </p>
