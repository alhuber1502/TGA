      <p>I dont mean to trouble you with any farther Searches; but I must thank you for your
         readiness to oblige me. I will try to return it by keeping the Roll<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as long as I can, that you may see it, if you look Londonwards; it is really a great
         Curiosity, &amp; will furnish one with remarks. Not that I am going to answer such trumpery
         as Guthrie's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who does not seem to disagree with me (tho I scarce can discover the scope of his
         jumbled arguments) but is angry I did not declare I agreed with him, tho I vow I never
         saw his book. It shall rest in peace for me, as all such Writers ever shall. The few
         Criticisms I have suffered have done more than my own arguments coud: They have strengthened
         my opinion, seeing how little can be advanced to overturn it. Mr Hume has shown me
         an answer he has drawn up. It is nothing but his former arguments enlarged: no one
         new fact or new light.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I am trying to persuade him to publish it, that I may have occasion to add a Short
         appendix, with some striking particulars; not, to dispute more with him. I propose
         too to give eight or nine figures from Rous's roll.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> In the Coronation roll, is this Entry, which you &amp; I overlooked: <span style="font-style:italic">Things ordered in haste by My Lord Duke of Buckingham.</span> Then Immediately follow the Robes for Edward 5th.–proof I think of the Design that
         He shoud walk.</p>
      <p>I shall correct a mistake I find (by Guthrie) I made, about the Duke of Albany.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> For the Confession of the Lady Butler, I take it to be an absolute Lie. The Commission
         of Sr James Tirrel I have not had time to search for in Rymer,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> where I suppose it is, if any where. But you did not observe that It is dated in
         Nov. 1482. Consequently under Edward <span style="font-style:italic">4th</span>. &amp; if true, contradicts Sr T. More, who says Tirrel was kept down. If the Date shoud
         be 83; it was subsequent by two or three months to the time assigned for the murder.
         But enough of all this till I see you.</p>
      <p>Have you read the two new volumes of Swift?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> The Second is the dullest heap of trumpery, flattery, &amp; folly. The first is curious
         indeed! what a Man! what childish, vulgar Stuff! what gross language to his Goddess!
         what a curious Scene when the Ministry thought themselves ruined! what Cowardice in
         Such a Bully!–then his libels, &amp; his exciting the Ministers to punish libels in the
         same breath!–the next moment generous &amp; benevolent. But his great Offence with me,
         is preventing a poor fellow from being pardoned, who was accused of ravishing his
         own Strumpet.</p>
      <p>I think you will like Sterne's sentimental travels,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which tho often tiresome, are exceedingly goodnatured &amp; picturesque.</p>

         <p>P.S. I this moment hear that the Robbery &amp; setting fire to Mr Conway's House<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was committed by a Servant belonging to the Duke of Richmond. I know no more yet.
            They had a great Escape of their lives, tho the loss &amp; damage is considerable; &amp; they
            have been most unhappy, as they have none but old &amp; faithfull Servants, &amp; coud not
            be persuaded any of them were guilty.</p>
