         your account; far from having any such confidence in myself, as to imagine any thing
         I can say should lighten your affliction; I fear your own good Sense, and Resignation
         to Him, who has spared so long the best of Mothers to you, is hardly able to support
         you under it; I can the easier imagine the Situation you are in from the fears, which
         are continually before my eyes, of a like misfortune in my own case;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if that were really to happen, I know not the least Shadow of comfort, that could
         come to me, but what I perhaps might find in my dearest Horace's compassion, &amp; that
         pity, he never denies the unhappy: would to God, I might alleviate in some measure
         his Sorrows, in the part I willingly would bear in them, &amp; in that commiseration,
         which I should feel for any one in such circumstances, how much more then for him
         whose friendship has been my greatest joy, &amp; I hope shall continue so many years:
         for God's sake, as soon as melancholy reflection shall give you any intermission,
         let me hear of your welfare; let me have the pleasure of a line, or the sight of you,
         as soon as it can be proper: believe, I shall not enjoy a moments ease, till I have
         some information of your condition;</p>
