         <p>You have not then forgot me, &amp; I shall see you again: it suffices, &amp; there needed no other Excuse. I loved You too well not
					to forgive you without a Reason; but I could not but be sorry for myself. </p>
         <p>You are lazy (you say) &amp; listless &amp; gouty &amp; old, &amp; vex'd and perplex'd: I am all that (the Gout excepted) &amp; many
					Things more, that I hope you never will be: so that what you tell me on that Head est trop flateux
					pour moi: our Imperfections may at least excuse, &amp; perhaps recommend us to one another: methinks I can readily pardon Sickness
					&amp; Age &amp; Vexation for all the Depredations they make within &amp; without, when I think they make us better Friends &amp; better
					Men, wch I am persuaded is often the Case. I am very sure, I have seen the best-temper'd generous tender young Creatures in the World,
					that would have been very glad to be sorry for People they liked, when under any Pain, and could not; merely for Want of knowing
					rightly, what it was, themselves.</p>
         <p>I find Mr Walpole then made some Mention of me to you. yes, we are together again. it is about a Year, I believe, since he wrote to
					me to offer it, &amp; there has been (particularly of late) in Appearance the same Kindness &amp; Confidence almost as of old. what
					were his Motives I can not yet guess: what were mine, you will imagine, &amp; perhaps blame me.
					however as yet I neither repent, nor rejoice overmuch: but I am pleased. he is full, I assure you, of your Panegyric. never any body
					had half so much Wit as Mr Chute (wch is saying every thing with him, you know) &amp; Mr W.d is the
					finest young Man, that ever was imported. I hope to embrace this fine Man (if I can) &amp; thank him
					heartily for being my Advocate, tho' in vain: he is a good Creature, &amp; I am not sure but I shall be tempted to eat a Wing of him
					with Sellery-Sauce â€“ I am interrupted. whenever I know of your Time, I will be in Town
					presently. I can not but make Mrs Chute my best Acknowledgements for takeing my Part. Heaven keep you
					all! </p>
