      <p>The best News from Cornhill-shire is, that I have a little fever, which denies me
         the pleasure of seeing either You, or Alexander, or Downing-Street to day, but when
         that leaves me at my own Disposal, I shall be at yours; Covent-Garden has given me
         a Sort of Surfeit of Mr Rich &amp; his Cleverness, for I was at the Way of the World,
         when the Machine broke t'other Night; the House was in Amaze for above a Minute, &amp;
         I dare say a great many in the Galleries thought it very dextrously perform'd, &amp; that
         they scream'd as naturally, as heart could wish; till they found it was no jest by
         their calling for Surgeons; of whom several luckily happen'd to be in the Pit: I stayed
         to see the poor creatures brought out of the House, &amp; pity poor Mrs Buchanan not a
         little, whom I saw put into a Chair in such a fright, that as she is big with child,
         I question whether it may not kill her,
