				     <p>I send you my translation, which I did not engage in because I liked that part of the Poem, nor do I now send it to you because I
					think it deserves it, but merely to show you how I misspend my days.

				     <q>
					       <p>Third in the labours of the Disc came on, <lb/> With sturdy step and slow, Hippomedon; <lb/> Artful and strong he pois'd the
						well-known weight, <lb/> By Phlegyas warn'd, and fir'd by Mnestheus' fate, <lb/> That to avoid, and this to emulate. <lb/> His
						vigorous arm he try'd before he flung, <lb/> Brac'd all his nerves, and every sinew strung; <lb/> Then with a tempest's whirl and
						wary eye, <lb/> Pursu'd his cast, and hurl'd the orb on high; <lb/> The orb on high tenacious of its course, <lb/> True to the
						mighty arm that gave it force, <lb/> Far overleaps all bound, and joys to see <lb/> Its antient lord secure of victory. <lb/> The
						theatre's green height and woody wall <lb/> Tremble ere it precipitates its fall, <lb/> The ponderous mass sinks in the cleaving
						ground, <lb/> While vales and woods and echoing hills rebound. <lb/> As when from Ã†tna's smoaking summit broke, <lb/> The eyeless
						Cyclops heav'd the craggy rock; <lb/> Where Ocean frets beneath the dashing oar, <lb/> And parting surges round the vessel roar;
						<lb/> 'Twas there he aim'd the meditated harm, <lb/> And scarce Ulysses scap'd his giant arm. <lb/> A tyger's pride the victor bore
						away, <lb/> With native spots and artful labour gay, <lb/> A Shining border round the margin roll'd, <lb/> And calm'd the terrors
						of his claws in gold. </p>
