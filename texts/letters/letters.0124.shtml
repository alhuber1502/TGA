      <p>Your fragment is in Aulus Gellius;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and both it and your Greek delicious. But why are you thus melancholy? I am so sorry
         for it, that you see I cannot forbear writing again the very first opportunity; though
         I have little to say, except to expostulate with you about it. I find you converse
         much with the dead, and I do not blame you for that; I converse with them too, though
         not indeed with the Greek. But I must condemn you for your longing to be with them.
         What, are there no joys among the living? I could almost cry out with Catullus<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> 'Alphene immemor, atque unanimis false sodalibus!' But to turn an accusation thus
         upon another, is ungenerous; so I will take my leave of you for the present with a
         'Vale et vive paullisper cum vivis.'<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
