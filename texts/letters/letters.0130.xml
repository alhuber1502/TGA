            <p>Jews-Harp. ask Mr Whithed, whither when he goes to Heaven, he does not expect to see all his favourite Hens, all his dear little
							Pouts, untimely Victims of the Pot &amp; the Spit, come pipping &amp; gobbling in a melodious Voice
						about him. I know, he does, there's nothing so natural. Poor Conti! is he going to be a Cherub? I
						remember here (but he was not ripe then) he had a very promiseing Squeak with him, &amp; that his Mouth, when open, made an exact
							Square. I have never been at Ranelagh Gardens since they were open'd (for what does it signify to me?) but they do not succeed. People see it once or twice &amp; so they go to Vaux-Hall. well, but is
						not it a very great Design, very new, finely lighted? well, yes, aye, very fine truly; &amp; so they yawn, &amp; go to Vaux-Hall.
						&amp; then it's too hot, &amp; then it's too cold, &amp; here's a Wind, &amp; there's a Damp; &amp; so the Women go to Bed, &amp; the
						Men to a Bawdy-House. you are to take Notice, that in our Country Delicacy &amp; Indelicacy amount to
						much the same thing, the first will not be pleased with any Thing, &amp; the other cannot: however to do us Justice, I think, we are a
						reasonable, but by no means a pleasurable People, &amp; to mend us we must have a Dash of the French, &amp; Italian. yet I don't know
						how, Travelling does not produce its right Effect â&#x80;&#x93; I find, I am talking; but You are to attribute it to my haveing at last
						found a Pen, that writes.</p>
            <p>You are so good, 'tis a shame to scold at you, but you never till now certified me, that you were at Casa Ambrosio. I did not know in what Light to consider you. I had an Idea, but did not know where to put it, for an Idea
						must have a Place per campeggiar bene. You were an Intaglia unset, a Picture without a Frame. but now
						all is well; tho' I am not very sure yet, whither you are above Stairs, or on the Ground-floor; but by your mentioning the
							Terrazzino, it must be the latter. do the Frogs of Arno sing as sweetly, as they did in my Days? do
						you sup al fresco? Have you a Mugherino Tree &amp; a <hi rend="italic">Nanny</hi>? I fear, I don't
						spell this last Word right: pray, ask Mr M:; oh dear! I fear I am a Blunderer about Hyacynths, for to
						be sure, they can't be taken out of the Ground till they have done blooming, &amp; they are perhaps just now in Flower. that you may
						know my <hi rend="italic">Place,</hi> I am just going into the Country for one easy fortnight, &amp; then in earnest intend to go to Cambridge to Trinity Hall. my sole
						Reason (as you know) is to look, as if â&#x80;&#x93; and when I feel it go against my Stomach, I remember
						it was Your Prescription, and so it goes down: look upon me then, my Dear Sr, in my proper Light, &amp; consider how necessary it is
						to me to hear from You, as often as you can bestow an Hour upon me; I flatter myself, your Kindness will try to get the better of your
						Indolence, when you reflect how cruelly alone I must be in the midst of that Crowd!</p>
            <p>The Remainder of this Page I hope you will pardon me, if I dedicate to my good Mr Mann.</p>

               <salute>Sr, </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I had the pleasure of receiveing Your good dear Letter, &amp; only defer'd thanking You till now, that I might be able to execute
						your little Commission first, the Contents of which I send to your Brother along with this Letter.
						but first let me enquire, how you do. alas! Sr, you may call 'em, Benevoli, or whatever soft Names you please, but I much fear they
						don't understand their business like our people with a thousand Consonants. I perfectly believe Dr Cocchi's good Intentions, but he is not the Executioner himself, &amp; here it is not sufficient to wish well; if
						it were I'm sure my Wishes are fervent enough to be felt even at Florence in spight of all the Lakes, &amp; Seas, &amp; Enemies, that lie betwixt us. they are daily employ'd for your Happiness, &amp; will, I hope, be of more Use to
						You, than they have been to myself. the Books, I send you, are the Etat de la France, 3 Vol: Fol:Â°
						upon my Word an excellent book. he is a sensible, knowing, Englishman, only had the Misfortune to be born in France. Life of
							Mahomet, by the same Author, it is famous: you are desired to make no reflections, nor draw
						Consequences, when you read it. Ld Burleigh's Papers â&#x80;&#x93; seem very curious, &amp; well enough
						chose. by the way, they have lately publish'd Thurlow's Papers here in 7 Vol: folio, out of which it
						would be hard to collect a Pocket-Volume worth haveing. Dr Middleton's Cicero, 3 Vol: &amp; a Letter
						on the Catholick Religion worth your reading. Philip de Comines, 5 Vol: the Louvre Edition is much more splendid, but wants the Supplement,
						&amp; Notes, wch are here. W:n on the M:s a very impudent fellow: his Dedications will make you
						laugh. Ludlow's Memoirs, 3 Vol: as unorthodox in Politics, as the other in Religion. 2 lyttel Bookys
						tocheing Kyng James, the fyrst: very rare . . Le Sopha, de
						Crebillon â&#x80;&#x93; Collect: of Plays, 10 Vol: there are none of Shakespear, because you had better
						have all his Works together. â&#x80;&#x93; they come to about Â£7 18<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> the whole Cargo.
						you will find among them 3 Parts of Marianne, for Mr Chute. if he has them already, how can I help
						it? why would he make no mention of Mad:lle de Thevire to me?</p>
            <p>And now let me congratulate you, as no longer a Min: but, far del Mondo! veramente un Ministrone, &amp; King of the Mediterranean. pray your
						Majesty, give Orders to your Men of War, if they touch at Naples, to take care of the Parma Collection, &amp; be sure, don't let them bombard Genoa. if you can bully the Pope out of the Apollo Belvedere, well &amp; good: I'm not
						against it. I'm enchanted with your good Sister, the Queen of Hungary; as old as I am, I could
						almost fight for her myself. see what it is to be happy; every body will fight for those, that have no occasion for them. pray, take
						care to continue so; but whither you do, or not, I am truly</p>
