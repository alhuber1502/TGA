            <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>All this time have I been waiting to say something to the purpose, &amp; now am just as far off as at first. Stuart appointed Mr Weddell an hour, when I was to meet him, &amp; (after staying an infinite while at his lodgings
					in expectation) he never came: indeed he was gone out of Town. the <hi rend="italic">drawing</hi> &amp; your <hi rend="italic">questions</hi> remain in Weddell's hands to be shew'd to this Rogue, as soon as he can meet with him: but I firmly believe, when he
					has got them, he will do nothing. so you must tell me, what I am to do with them. I have shew'd the Epitaph to no one but Hurd, who
					entirely approves it. he made no objection, but to one line (&amp; that was mine) <hi rend="italic">Heav'n lifts</hi> &amp;c: so if you please to make another, you may: for my part I rather like it still.</p>
         <p>I begin to think of drawing northwards (if my wretched matters will let me) &amp; am going to write to Mr Brown about it. you are to
					consider, whether you will be able or willing to receive us at Aston about a fortnight hence, or whether we are to find you at York,
					where I suppose you to be at present. this you will let me know soon, &amp; if I am disappointed, I will tell you in time. you will
					tell me, what to do with your <hi rend="italic">Zumpe,</hi>
					 wch has amused me much here. if you would have it sent down, I had better commit it to its Maker, who
					will tune it &amp; pack it up. Dr Long has bought the fellow to it. the base is not quite of a piece with the treble, &amp; the higher
					notes are somewhat dry &amp; sticky: the rest discourses very eloquent musick.</p>
