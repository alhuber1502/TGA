				     <p>I paid the sum abovemention'd this morning at Gillam's Office in Bishopsgate-Street: the remittance
					you will please to pay out of it. I have not time to add all the bad news of the times, but in a few
					days you shall have some of it; tho' the worst of all is just what I can not write. I am perfectly out of humour, &amp; so will you
					be.</p>
				     <p>Mason is here, &amp; has brought his Wife, a pretty, modest, innocent, interesting figure, looking like 18, tho' she is near 28. she
					does not speak, only whispers, &amp; her cough as troublesome as ever: yet I have great hopes, there is nothing consumptive. she is
					strong &amp; in good spirits. we were all at the Opera together on Saturday last. they desire their
					loves to you. I have seen Mr Talbot, &amp; Delaval lately.</p>

				     <postscript>
					       <p>I can not find Mons: de la Chalotais in any of the shops. Ld St: I
						am told is to be married here. I know nothing of Pa:, but that he was still at Mr Weddell's a
						fortnight since. Be so good to tell me you have received this (if you can) by the return of the Post.</p>
