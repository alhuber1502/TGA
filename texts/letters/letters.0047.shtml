   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>Receiving no Answer to my last letter,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which I writ above a month ago, I must own I am a little uneasy. The slight shadow
         of you which I had in town,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has only served to endear you to me the more. The moments I past with you made a
         strong impression upon me. I singled you out for a friend, and I would have you know
         me to be yours, if you deem me worthy. –Alas, Gray, you cannot imagine how miserably
         my time passes away. My health and nerves and spirits are, thank my stars, the very
         worst, I think, in Oxford. Four-and-twenty hours of pure unalloy'd health together,
         are as unknown to me as the 400,000 characters in the Chinese vocabulary. One of my
         complaints has of late been so over-civil as to visit me regularly once a month–jam
         certus conviva.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> This is a painful nervous headach, which perhaps you have sometimes heard me speak
         of before. Give me leave to say, I find no physic comparable to your letters. If,
         as it is said in Ecclesiasticus 'Friendship be the physic of the mind',<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> prescribe to me, dear Gray, as often and as much as you think proper, I shall be
         a most obedient patient.</p>

      <p>I venture here to write you down a Greek epigram,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which I lately turned into Latin, and hope you will excuse it.</p>
