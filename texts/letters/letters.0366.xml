         <p>Not knowing whether you are yet returned from your seawater, I write at random to you. For me, I am come to my resting place, and
					find it very necessary, after living for a month in a house with three women that laughed from
					morning to night, and would allow nothing to the sulkiness of my disposition. Company and cards at home, parties by land and water
						abroad, and (what they call) <hi rend="italic">doing something,</hi> that is, racketting about from
					morning to night, are occupations, I find, that wear out my spirits, especially in a situation where one might sit still, and be alone
					with pleasure; for the place was a hill like Clifden, opening to a very extensive and diversified
					landscape, with the Thames, which is navigable, running at its foot.</p>
         <p>I would wish to continue here (in a very different scene, it must be confessed) till Michaelmas; but I fear I must come to town much
					sooner. Cambridge is a delight of a place, now there is nobody in it. I do believe you would like it, if you knew what it was without
					inhabitants. It is they, I assure you, that get it an ill name and spoil all. Our friend Dr. Chapman
					(one of its nuisances) is not expected here again in a hurry. He is gone to his grave with five fine mackerel (large and full of roe)
					in his belly. He eat them all at one dinner; but his fate was a turbot on Trinity Sunday, of which he
					left little for the company besides bones. He had not been hearty all the week; but after this sixth fish he never held up his head
					more, and a violent looseness carried him off. â€“ They say he made a very good end.</p>
         <p>Have you seen the Erse Fragments since they were printed? I am more puzzled than ever about their
					antiquity, though I still incline (against everybody's opinion) to believe them old. Those you have already seen are the best; though
					there are some others that are excellent too. </p>
