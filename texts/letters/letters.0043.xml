				     <p>After a month's expectation of you, and a fortnight's despair, at Cambridge, I am come to town, and to better hopes of seeing you. If
					what you sent me last be the product of your melancholy, what may I not expect from your more cheerful
					hours? For by this time the ill health that you complain of is (I hope) quite departed; though, if I were self-interested, I ought to
					wish for the continuance of any thing that could be the occasion of so much pleasure to me. Low spirits are my true and faithful
					companions; they get up with me, go to bed with me, make journeys and returns as I do; nay, and pay
					visits, and will even affect to be jocose, and force a feeble laugh with me; but most commonly we sit alone together, and are the
					prettiest insipid company in the world. However, when you come, I believe they must undergo the fate of all humble companions, and be
					discarded. Would I could turn them to the same use that you have done, and make an Apollo of them. If they could write such verses with
					me, not hartshorn, nor spirit of amber, nor all that furnishes the closet of an apothecary's widow,
					should persuade me to part with them: But, while I write to you, I hear the bad news of Lady Walpole's death on Saturday night
						last. Forgive me if the thought of what my poor Horace must feel on that account, obliges me to have
					done in reminding you that I am</p>
