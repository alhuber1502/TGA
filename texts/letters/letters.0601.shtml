      <p>I am return'd, my dear B., from the little journey I had made into Suffolk<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> without answering the end proposed. The thought, that you might have been with me
         there, has embitter'd all my hours. Your letter has made me happy; as happy as so
         gloomy, so solitary a Being as I am is capable of being. I know and have too often
         felt the disadvantages I lay myself under, how much I hurt the little interest I have
         in you, by this air of sadness so contrary to your nature and present enjoyments:
         but sure you will forgive, tho' you can not sympathize with me. It is impossible with
         me to dissemble with you. Such as I am, I expose my heart to your view, nor wish to
         conceal a single thought from your penetrating eyes.–All that you say to me, especially
         on the subject of Switzerland, is infinitely acceptable. It feels too pleasing ever
         to be fulfill'd, and as often as I read over your truly kind letter, written long
         since from London, I stop at these words: <span style="font-style:italic">La mort qui peut glacer nos bras avant qu'ils soient entrelacés.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
