         <p>I must beg you would present my most grateful acknowledgements to your learned Society for the publick mark of their esteem, which
					you say they are disposed to confer on me. I embrace, with so deep &amp; just a sense of their
					goodness the <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> of that honour they do me, that I hope it may plead my pardon with them, if I do not
					accept the <hi rend="italic">form.</hi> I have been, Sr, for several years a Member of the University of Cambridge, &amp; formerly
					(when I had some thoughts of the profession) took a Batchelor of Laws degree there: since that time,
					tho' long qualified by my standing, I have always neglected to finish my course, &amp; claim my Doctor's degree. judge therefore, whether it will not look like a slight &amp; some sort of contempt, if I receive the same
					degree from a Sister-University. I certainly would avoid giving any offence to a set of Men, among whom I have pass'd so many easy,
					&amp; (I may say) happy hours of my life: yet shall ever retain in my memory the obligations You have laid me under, &amp; be proud of
					my connection with the University of Aberdeen.</p>
         <p>It is a pleasure to me to find, that you are not offended with the liberties I took, when you were at Glames. you took me too literally, if you thought I meant in the least to discourage you in your pursuit of Poetry.
					all I intended to say was, that if either Vanity (that is, a general &amp; undistinguishing desire of applause) or Interest, or
					Ambition has any place in the breast of a poet, he stands a great chance in these our days of being severely disappointed: and yet
					after all these passions are suppress'd, there may remain in the mind of one, <hi rend="italic">ingenti perculsus amore</hi>
					 (and such a one I take you to be), incitements of a better sort strong enough to make him write
					verse all his life both for his own pleasure, &amp; that of all posterity.</p>
         <p>I am sorry for the trouble you have had to gratify my curiosity &amp; love of superstition, yet I
					heartily thank you. on Monday, Sr, I set forward on my way to England, where if I can be of any
					little use to you, or should ever have the good fortune to see you it will be a particular satisfaction to me. Ld Strathmore &amp; the
					Family here desire me to make their compliments to You.</p>
