         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I send you with this a drawing of the Ruin<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you were so much pleasd with when you saw it at York. I take it certainly to have
         been the Chapell of St Sepulchre founded by Archbishop Roger<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of wch Dugdale<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has given us the original Charta Fundationis. But as this opinion seems to contradict
         the opinion of Torre,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; of Drake<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> too, who follows him, It is necessary to produce authentic Authority in proof of
         my Assertion. These two learned Antiquarys suppose that the Chapell in quÃ¦stion <span style="font-style:italic">ioind</span> to the Minster. Thus Torre: 'Roger <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> ABp having built <span style="font-style:italic">against</span> the great Church a Chapell.' &amp; Drake: 'Roger was buried in the Cathedral <span style="font-style:italic">near the door of</span> St. Sepulchres chapel wch he himself had founded.' Vide Drake's Ebor: P. 478. P.
         421. From these accts we should be led to conclude that this Chapell was as much and
         as close an appendage to the Minster as the Chapterhouse is. But the original records
         on wch they found this opinion May I think be construed very differently.</p>
      <p>ABp Roger himself in his Charta Fundationis describes its situation thus. 'Capellam
         quamâ&#x80;&#x93;<span style="font-style:italic">juxta</span> majorem Ecclesiam extruximus.' Juxta is surely <span style="font-style:italic">near</span> only, not <span style="font-style:italic">adjoining</span> and this ruin is <span style="font-style:italic">near</span> enough. In the Extract of this ABps life from an antient MS wch Dugdale also gives
         us we find these words 'Condidit etiam Capellam Sancti Sepulchri <span style="font-style:italic">ad Januam ipsius Palatii</span> ex parte boreali ejusd. Eccles S. Petri.' The Ruin in quÃ¦stion might very probably
         be connected with the Pallace gate by a Cloyster of wch on one side there are a string
         of Arches remaining, and on the outside of the Minster over the little gate next the
         Tomb there are also vestiges of the roof of a Cloyster wch I imagine went asside the
         Pallace gateway &amp; connected the three buildings. Vide plan. But between this little
         gate &amp; the Pallace gate (which still remains) it is very evident there was no room
         for any thing but a Cloyster, for I dont think they are twenty yards asunder.</p>
      <p>The last and only further acct I can find of the situation is from the same Life.
         Where it is said The Canons of St Peter graviter murmurabant super situ dictÃ¦ capellÃ¦
         eo quod <span style="font-style:italic">nimis adhÃ¦sit</span> Matrici EcclesiÃ¦. This I think need not be translated litterally. the word nimis
         leads one to a metaphorical sense. The Preists of St Sepulchre were too near neighbours
         to St Peters Canons &amp; were troublesome to them, accordingly we find the ABp to quiet
         matters orderd that the Sacrist of his Chappel should make them a recompence, which
         is in this extract Stated.</p>
      <p>To These Arguments I would add that ABp Rogers donation was very great, (as we find
         in Drake) to this Chapell. and from the Number of Persons maintaind in its Service
         I quÃ¦stion not but there was a large Convent built round it, of wch there are plainly
         the foundations still to be seen. and what puts the matter out of all doubt that this
         building was seperate &amp; entire (tho indeed near to the Minster) is the following fact
         viz that the Tythes of the Chapell &amp; Chapell itself were sold to one Webster Ann:
         4 Q Eliz. 'Capella vocat: St Sepulcres Chapell <span style="font-style:italic">prope</span> Eccles: Cath Eborum cum decimis ejusdem. W. Webster. Ap: 4, Anno 4 Eliz. Rolls: Chap:
         Thus you see the <span style="font-style:italic">juxta</span> &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">prope</span> are clearly on my side the <span style="font-style:italic">nimis adhÃ¦sit</span> is equivocal. I conclude with a rude Draught of the Platform according to my Idea,
         but without any mensuration &amp; merely to explain what has been said. I am with the
         greatest respect &amp; defference to your Sagacity.</p>

      <div class="postscript">
         <p>P.S. I ought to mention to you, that in the transept (I think you call it) of the
            Church namely at B there is at the top over the large Pillars, a range of Stonework
            like the windows in the ruin, viz three pointed arches under a circular one, but of
            a clumsey proportion. This part I think you said was the oldest in the Minster. Johny
            Ludlam<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> found this out. perhaps it contradicts all Ive been saying &amp; proves the Building
            much older than Bp Roger.</p>
