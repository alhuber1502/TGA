      <p>I intend to be at Strawberry on Monday before dinner. but as Saints have the Diabetes,
         you will not wonder if a miserable Sinner can not answer a day beforehand for his
         own constitution. seriously it has not been fair weather within me, eversince I came
         into this country. at Mr Chute's I was not quite right; &amp; since my return, particularly
         this morning, I am sensible of a feverish disposition, &amp; little wandering pains, that
         may fix into the Gout, &amp; confine me again. if so, you will excuse the caprices of
         my distemper, &amp; conclude, that it came upon me too suddenly for me to give you notice
         in time.
