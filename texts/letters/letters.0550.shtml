      <p>P: 339, &amp; 340. The Abbot of Mesx</p>
      <p>Look in a Map of the East-riding of Yorkshire, &amp; you will see that at a few miles
         distance North of <span style="font-style:italic">Lekenfield</span> lies <span style="font-style:italic">Watton;</span> to the South lies <span style="font-style:italic">Beverley</span> (the usual Burying-Place of the Percies); &amp; to the S: East the Abbey of <span style="font-style:italic">Meaux,</span>  of which there are still some remains visible: the name is pronounced <span style="font-style:italic">Meuss.</span> (Mr Mason dictates this note)
      </p>
      <p>Mr Percy's note therefore is wrong. </p>
