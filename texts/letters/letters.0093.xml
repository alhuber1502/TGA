					       <dateline>Rome, April 2, N. S. 1740. </dateline>
				     </opener>
				     <p>This is the [eighth] day since we came to Rome, but the first hour I have had to write to you in.
					The journey from Florence cost us four days, one of which was spent at Sienna, an agreeable, clean, old city, of no great magnificence,
					or extent; but in a fine situation, and good air. What it has most considerable is its cathedral, a huge pile of marble, black and
					white laid alternately, and laboured with a gothic niceness and delicacy in the old-fashioned way. Within too are some paintings and
					sculpture of considerable hands. The sight of this, and some collections that were showed us in private houses, were a sufficient
					employment for the little time we were to pass there; and the next morning we set forward on our journey through a country very oddly
					composed; for some miles you have a continual scene of little mountains cultivated from top to bottom with rows of olive-trees, or else
					elms, each of which has its vine twining about it, and mixing with the branches; and corn sown between all the ranks. This, diversified
					with numerous small houses and convents, makes the most agreeable prospect in the world: But, all of a sudden, it alters to black
					barren hills, as far as the eye can reach, that seem never to have been capable of culture, and are as ugly as useless. Such is the
					country for some time before one comes to Mount Radicofani, a terrible black hill, on the top of which we were to lodge that night. It
					is very high, and difficult of ascent; and at the foot of it we were much embarrassed by the fall of one of the poor horses that drew
					us. This accident obliged another chaise, which was coming down, to stop also; and out of it peeped a figure in a red cloak, with a
					handkerchief tied round its head, which, by its voice and mien, seemed a fat old woman; but, upon its
					getting out, appeared to be Senesino, who was returning from Naples to Sienna, the place of his birth
					and residence. On the highest part of the mountain is an old fortress, and near it a house built by one of the Grand Dukes for a
					hunting-seat, but now converted into an inn: It is the shell of a large fabrick, but such an inside, such chambers, and accommodations,
					that your cellar is a palace in comparison; and your cat sups and lies much better than we did; for, it being a saint's eve, there was
					nothing but eggs. We devoured our meager fare; and, after stopping up the windows with the quilts, were obliged to lie upon the straw
					beds in our clothes. Such are the conveniences in a road, that is, as it were, the great thoroughfare of all the world. Just on the
					other side of this mountain, at Ponte-Centino, one enters the patrimony of the church; a most delicious country, but thinly inhabited.
					That night brought us to Viterbo, a city of a more lively appearance than any we had lately met with; the houses have glass windows,
					which is not very usual here, and most of the streets are terminated by a handsome fountain. Here we had the pleasure of breaking our
					fast on the leg of an old hare and some broiled crows. Next morning, in descending Mount Viterbo, we first discovered (though at near
					thirty miles distance) the cupola of St. Peter's, and a little after began to enter on an old Roman pavement, with now and then a
					ruined tower, or a sepulcher on each hand. We now had a clear view of the city, though not to the best advantage, as coming along a
					plain quite upon a level with it; however, it appeared very vast, and surrounded with magnificent villas and gardens. </p>
				     <p>We soon after crossed the Tiber, a river that ancient Rome made more considerable than any merit of its own could have done: However,
					it is not contemptibly small, but a good handsome stream; very deep, yet somewhat of a muddy complexion. The first entrance of Rome is
					prodigiously striking. It is by a noble gate, designed by Michel Angelo, and adorned with statues; this brings you into a large square,
					in the midst of which is a vast obelisk of granite, and in front you have at one view two churches of a handsome architecture, and so
					much alike that they are called the twins; with three streets, the middlemost of which is one of the longest in Rome. As high as my
					expectation was raised, I confess, the magnificence of this city infinitely surpasses it. You cannot pass along a street but you have
					views of some palace, or church, or square, or fountain, the most picturesque and noble one can imagine. We have not yet set about
					considering its beauties, ancient and modern, with attention; but have already taken a slight transient view of some of the most
					remarkable. St. Peter's I saw the day after we arrived, and was struck dumb with wonder. I there saw the Cardinal d'Auvergne, one of the French ones, who, upon coming off his journey, immediately repaired hither to offer up his vows
					at the high altar, and went directly into the Conclave; the doors of which we saw opened to him, and all the other immured Cardinals
					came thither to receive him. Upon his entrance they were closed again directly. It is supposed they will not come to an agreement about
					a Pope till after Easter, though the confinement is very disagreeable. I have hardly philosophy enough to see the infinity of fine
					things, that are here daily in the power of any body that has money, without regretting the want of it; but custom has the power of
					making things easy to one. I have not yet seen his majesty of Great-Britain, &amp;c. though I have the
					two boys in the gardens of the Villa Borgese, where they go a-shooting almost every day; it was at a distance, indeed, for we did not
					choose to meet them, as you may imagine. This letter (like all those the English send, or receive) will pass through the hands of that
					family, before it comes to those it was intended for. They do it more honour than it deserves; and all they will learn from thence will
					be, that I desire you to give my duty to my father, and wherever else it is due, and that I am, &amp;c. </p>
