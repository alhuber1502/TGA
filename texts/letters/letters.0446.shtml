         <div class="salute">Dear Sr</div>
      </div>
      <p>Since I have been here, I have received from you, &amp; by your means, five letters. that
         from Pa:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I could wish, you had open'd; as I know, you by your good will would have done. the
         sum of it is, that he is at Geneva with the Rhone tumbling its blew &amp; green tide directly
         under his window. that he has pass'd a fortnight in the Pais de Vaux, &amp; the Cantons
         of Bern, Fribourg, &amp; Soleurre, &amp; return'd by the Lake of Neufchatel. that the whole
         country &amp; particularly the last-named appear'd to him astonishingly beautiful. he
         enquired much after Rousseau,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but did not meet with him. his residence is at <span style="font-style:italic">Moitier</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <span style="font-style:italic">au Travers</span> about 4 Leagues from Neufchatel, where he lives in great plenty, the Booksellers
         at the Hague being his Bank, &amp; ready to answer any sum he draws for. it is amazing,
         what he got by his two last books.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he is often flying about from village to village, generally wears a sort of Armenian
         dress,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; posses for a kind of Misanthrope, but is held in great veneration by the people.</p>
      <p>He says, he saw all the matters that come in course in France, &amp; was greatly disappointed.
         the only thing he mentions is the Church at Amiens, wch was really fine. they set
         out in a few days (his date is 19 Sept:) &amp; go by Chamberry to Turin, from whence he
         will write to you. his letter (he says) is not worth the postage, but it is the abundance,
         &amp; not the want, of matter, that makes it so poor.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>After this what shall I say to you of my Lilliputian travels? on Monday<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I think to see Salisbury, &amp; to be sure Wilton, &amp; Amesbury &amp; Stone-henge. this will
         take up three days, &amp; then I come back hither, &amp; think to be in London on Saturday
         or Monday after.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for the weather grows untoward, &amp; the Sea (that is this little miniature of it, Southampton-River)
         rages horribly, &amp; looks as if it would eat one. else I should have gone to Lymington
         &amp; Christchurch, &amp; call'd upon Mr Mansfield<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in the New-forest to see the Bow, that kill'd William Rufus, wch he pretends to possess.
         (say not a word of Andover!<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> ) my Ld Delawar has erected a little monument on the spot, where according to ancient
         tradition that King was slain,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; another in Gods-House Chappel,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> where the Earl of Cambridge,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Ld Scroop &amp; Sr Thomas Grey were inter'd by Henry 5th, after he had cut off their
         heads: it is in this Town, &amp; now the French Church. here lives Dr St Andre,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> famous for the affair of the Rabbit-Woman,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; for marrying Lady Betty Molyneux, after they had disposed of her first Husband.
         She died not long since in the odour of sanctity. he is 80 years old, &amp; is now building
         a Palazzino here hard by in a delightful spot call'd <span style="font-style:italic">Bellevue,</span> &amp; has lately produced a natural Son to inherit it. what do you say to poor Iwan,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the last Russ Manifesto? will no body kill me that Dragoness?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> must we wait, till her Son<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> does it himself.</p>
      <p>Mr St: has been at Glamis.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he tells me no news. he only confutes a piece of news I sent him, wch I am glad to
         hear, is a lye. I must tell you a small anecdote I just hear, that delights me. Sr
         F: Norton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has a mother living in a town in Yorkshire in a very indifferent lodging.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a good house was to be sold there the other day. he thought in decency he ought to
         appear willing to buy it for her. when the people, to whom it belongs, imagined that
         every thing was agreed on, he insisted on having two pictures as fixtures, wch they
         value at 60Â£. so Mrs Norton lives, where she did.</p>
      <p>I am sorry for the D: of Devonshire!<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the cause, I fear is losing ground; &amp; I know the Person (where Mr T:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has lately been) look'd upon all as gone, if this event should happen. Adieu! when
         I get to Town, I shall pick up something to tell you.</p>
