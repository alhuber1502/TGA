         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor</div>
      </div>
      <p>I have lately heard, that you have been very ill, &amp; that in the midst of your illness
         your poor Sister Ettrick<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was obliged to fly from her Persecutor, &amp; put herself under your protection. pray
         inform me, as soon as you can, of the state of your health in the first place, &amp; next,
         how you have been able to secure a poor frighted Woman from the brutality of such
         a husband, wch under our excellent constitution (I take it) is rather a more difficult
         thing, than it would be in Turkey.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>For me, I passed the latter part of the last autumn at Southampton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> all alone (for I went to no rooms,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> nor saw any company, as they call it) in a most beautiful country, &amp; very gentle
         climate. the air &amp; the walks agreed with me wonderfully. the sea-water I scarce tried
         (as the winter approached) enough to say, whether it would suit me, or not. some time
         after I return'd hither, came the gout in both feet successively, very gentle as to
         pain, but it left a weakness &amp; sense of lassitude behind it, that even yet is not
         wholly dissipated. I have a great propensity to Hartlepool this summer, it is in your
         neighbourhood, &amp; that is to make up for climate &amp; for trees. the sea, the turf, &amp;
         the rocks, I remember, have merit enough of their own. Mr Brown is so invincibly attach'd
         to his duties of Treasurer &amp; Tutor, &amp; I know not what, that I give up all hopes of
         bringing him with me: nor do I (till I have been at London) speak determinately as
         to myself: perhaps I may find good reasons (against my inclination) to change my mind.
      </p>
      <p>Your Mother, the University, has succeeded in her great cause against the Secretary
         of State.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Ld Hardwick is declared duely elected by a Majority of one voice. all the Judges
         of the King's-bench took occasion to declare their opinion in set speeches on the
         question; I suppose, in order to gain a little popularity, for whatever seems against
         Ld S:, must be popular. Ld Mansfield was express on two points, that the Universities
         were not subject to any Royal Visitations, but might always apply to &amp; receive redress
         from his Maj:s Courts of Justice; &amp; that they were bound by no statutes, but such
         as they themselves had thought fit to receive. these things are doubtless of far more
         consequence to them than the cause in question, for wch I am the less concern'd, because
         I do believe the two Pretenders had (privately) agreed the matter beforehand,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for the House of Yorke have undoubtedly been long making up to the Court. I should
         tell you, that Dr. Long's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Affidavit was only begun to be read, &amp; laid aside as of no consequence. I suppose
         you know by this time, that our Friend the B: of Ch:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was the private Embassador of Ld S: to this place, &amp; made proposals in his name.
         he also was present on the side of that worthy Nobleman at the remarkable interview
         with Mr Charles Yorke.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is certain he refused the Archb:k of Armagh;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but why, I can not yet learn: some say, because they intended to quarter so many
         pensions upon it: others, because they would keep to themselves the disposal of all
         the preferments. but neither of these seem to be sufficient reasons. it is sure, he
         wrote circular letters to his friends to acquaint them of this refusal, &amp; that he
         was snub'd for doing so. whereas Bp Newton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to whom it was first offer'd, made a great secret of it, as a good Courtier should
         do. now I am talking of Bishops, I must tell you, that not long ago B:P Warburton
         in a sermon at Court asserted, that all preferments were bestow'd on the most illiterate
         &amp; worthless objects, &amp; in speaking turn'd himself about &amp; stared directly at the Bp.
         of London.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he added, that if any one arose distinguish'd for merit &amp; learning, there was a combination
         of dunces to keep him down. I need not tell you, that he expected the Bk of London
         himself, when Terrick got it.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> so ends my ecclesiastical history.
      </p>
      <p>Our friend, the Precentor, who has so long been in a <span style="font-style:italic">mariturient</span> way, is not yet married,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; I doubt, it is all gone off. I dare not ask about it, but if I goe northward, shall
         take him in my way, &amp; see, whether he will tell me. present my best compliments to
         Mrs. Wharton, &amp; Miss.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have no idea of the family at present, &amp; expect to see a multitude of little new
         faces, that know not Joseph.
