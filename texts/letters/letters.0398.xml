            <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I have sent down by Gillam's waggon to-day 28 parcels of
					different bulks, wch I suppose will be deliver'd on Monday morning, &amp; must beg the favour, that you will see put into my rooms.
					they are as follows <q>
               <p>1, x2 Chests of Books. <lb/> x3 A Fire grate &amp; instruments <lb/> 4 Steel-Fender <lb/> x5 Basket of Earthen-ware, glasses,
							&amp;c. <lb/> x6 Black Travelling Chest. <lb/> x7 Wainscot-Box<lb/> x8 Sofa. <lb/> 9 Back to
							the same. <lb/> x10 Deal Book-Case taken to pieces. <lb/> x11 Wainscot Chest of Drawers. <lb/> x12 Night-Table. <lb/> x13 Round
							Table, &amp;c. <lb/> x14 Breakfast-Table, &amp;c. <lb/> x15 Small Chest of Drawers. <lb/> x16, x17 Two Feather Beds, &amp;c <lb/>
							x18, x19 Bedstead in two parts. <lb/> 20 Settee &amp; Stools. <lb/> x21, x22, x23 Six Chairs. <lb/> x24, x25, x26 Six slighter
							chairs. <lb/> x27 Fly-Table and Wash-Stand.<lb/> x28 Basket with pillows, cushions, &amp;c: </p>
            </q> Those marked with a cross are easier to break, &amp; therefore pray observe if they appear to have received any damage in coming.
					you will take notice of No 6, &amp; 7 for another reason, because in them are Papers &amp; other things of value to me. they may all
					stand pack'd up as they are, till I come, wch will be in about three weeks, I guess: in the mean time
					I beg no fire may be made, nor any body go flaunting in with a candle, for so many mats &amp; so much packing will make it very
						dangerous.
				</p>
         <p>Mr Gillam (I reckon) will stay for his money till I arrive. </p>
         <p>We are all much out of countenance about this pension. I dare not see Delaval any more, &amp;
					expect to hear Mason has taken Laudanum.</p>
