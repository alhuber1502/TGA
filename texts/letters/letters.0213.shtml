      </div>
      <p>I am not in a way of leaving this place yet this fortnight, &amp; consequently shall hardly
         see you in town. I rejoice in the mean time to think, that you are there, &amp; have left
         (I hope) a part of your disagreable reflections in the place, where they grew. Stoke
         has revived in me the memory of many a melancholy hour, that I have pass'd in it,
         &amp; tho' I have no longer the same cause for anxiety, I do not find myself at all the
         happier for thinking, that I have lost it. as my thoughts now signify nothing to any
         one, but myself, I shall wish to change the scene, as soon as ever I can.
      </p>
      <p>I am heartily glad to hear Mr Hutton is so reasonable, but am rather sorry to find
         that design is known to so many. Dr Wharton, who (I suppose) heard it from Avison,
         mentions it in a letter to me. were I you, I should have taken some pleasure in observing
         people's faces, &amp; perhaps in putting their kindness a little to the tryal. it is a
         very useful experiment; &amp; very possibly you will never have it in your power to put
         it in practise again. pray, make your bargain with all the circumspection, &amp; selfishness
         of an old Hunks; when you are grown as rich as Crœsus, do not grow too good-for-nothing.
         a little good-for-nothing to be sure you will grow: every body does in proportion
         to their circumstances, else indeed what should one do with one's money? my third
         <span style="font-style:italic">Sentence</span> is, don't anticipate your revenues, &amp; live upon air, till you know what you are worth.
         you bid me write no more than a scrall to you, therefore I will trouble you, as you
         are so busy, with nothing more.
      </p>

         <p>I should be obliged to you, if you had time to ask at Roberts's, or some place in
            Jermyn-street, whether I could be there about a fortnight hence. I won't give more
            than ½ a guinea a week, nor put up with a second floor, unless it has a tolerable
            room to the street. will you acquaint me of this?
