         <p> It is not oweing to insensibility (as by this time you may possibly imagine) but to the misfortune I had of staying longer than
					usual this winter in Town, that I have not sooner return'd you my thanks for the particular honour
					you did me, when you were at Cambridge. You tell me with so much warmth &amp; frankness, that I have
					given you pleasure, that it would be mere hypocrisy in me, if I did not confess to you with the same openness of mind, that I am
					pleased. my wish &amp; the only reward I ask in writing is to give some little satisfaction to a few Men of sense &amp; character. I
					say <hi>a few</hi>, because there are but few such: were they more numerous, I would wish (I own) to please them all; &amp; yet not
					fear being censured for too eager a desire of fame. but as much as your proceeding may have raised my vanity, I shall by no means
					promise that you will like your new acquaintance, when you see him <hi>out of print</hi>. however with all his imperfections on his
						head he will, be assured, make the experiment the very first opportunity, &amp; claim in person the
					honour you offer him, whenever he is so happy to find himself in the same place with you.</p>
         <p> I am <hi>much</hi> obliged to you for the Iris &amp; Aurora they are more elegant &amp; have more
					of the relish of antiquity than any thing I have met with in modern Italy. permit me to present my Compliments to Lady Swinburn. I am not known to her at all, and yet have had the honour of passing three days in her company. when &amp;
					where it was, I leave to her Ladyship's recollection.</p>
