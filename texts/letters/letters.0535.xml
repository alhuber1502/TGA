				     <p>Your Grace has dealt nobly with me; and the same delicacy of mind that induced you to confer this favour on me, unsolicited and
					unexpected, may perhaps make you averse to receive my sincerest thanks and grateful acknowledgments. Yet your Grace must excuse me,
					they will have their way: they are indeed but words; yet I know and feel they come from my heart, and therefore are not wholly unworthy
					of your Grace's acceptance. I even flatter myself (such is my pride) that you have some little satisfaction in your own work. If I did
					not deceive myself in this, it would compleat the happiness of, </p>
