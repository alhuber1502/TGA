         <p>[...]</p>
         <p>Every language has its idiom, not only of words and phrases, but of customs and manners, which cannot be represented in the tongue of
					another nation, especially of a nation so distant in time and place, without constraint and difficulty; of this sort, in the present
					instance, are the curfew bell, the Gothic Church, with its monuments, organs and anthems, the texts of Scripture, &amp;c. There are
					certain images, which, though drawn from common nature, and every where obvious, yet strike us as foreign to the turn and genius of
					Latin verse; the beetle that flies in the evening, to a Roman, I guess, would have appeared too mean an object for poetry; 'that leaves
					the world to darkness and to me', is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the
					right to drop it.</p>
         <p> [...]</p>
         <p> Might not the English characters here be romanized? Virgil is just as good as Milton, and CÃ¦sar as Cromwell, but who shall be
						Hampden?</p>
