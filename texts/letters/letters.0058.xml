				     <p>It seems you have forgot the poor little tenement in which you so long lodg'd, and have set your heart on some fine Castle in the
					air: I wish I were Master of the Seat you describe, that I might make your Residence more agreeable; but as it is, I fear you'll hardly
					meet with common Conveniences. </p>
				     <p>I deserve you should be angry with me for haveing been so little punctual, in paying my Dues, &amp; returning thanks for your advice
					some time since. All is at present, mighty well, that is, just as you remember it, &amp; imagin'd it would be: cool enough not to burn,
					and warm enough not to freeze one, but methinks the Counsel you gave me, was what you did not think proper to make use of in like
					Circumstances yourself; perhaps you know why the same way of acting should be improper for you, &amp; proper for me: I don't doubt but
					you have your reasons, &amp; I trust you would not have me do anything wrong. </p>
				     <p>The account W: gives me of your way of Life is better than I expected: to be sure you must meet
					daily with little particulars enough to fill a letter, and I should be pleasd with the most minute. Has Mrs L: a pimple upon her Nose? does her Woman love Citron Water? &amp;c: any of
					these would be a high regale for me. but perhaps you think it telling tales: you know best. Have you seen Madame Valmote? naughty Woman! was you at the Christening? is the Princess with Child again? was you at the review? have you wrote e'er a Critique on the Accidence? is
						Despauterius or Linacer most in your favor? but perhaps you think
					this, tittle-tattle. Well! you know best. Pot-fair is at its height; there's old raffleing. Walpole is
					gone to Stamford, &amp; to Lynn, but returns in a day or two. I am gone to the Carrier's with this letter, and am</p>
