      <p>Dugdale mentions (as if it still existed) a Chappel of the Virgin on the North-side
         of the Church; if this be true, it is the oldest part of the whole, being founded
         by A:<span class="super">p</span> Roger in Henry 2<span class="super">d's</span> time. be sure to look for it.
      </p>
      <p>Can you distinguish in the S: Transept two different styles that of Richard 1<span class="super">st's</span> time, &amp; that of Henry 3<span class="super">d's</span>? &amp; in the rest of y<span class="super">e</span> building three more kinds of architecture, that of Edw:<span class="super">1st</span> in the N: Transept; of Edw: 2<span class="super">d</span> in the Nave, &amp; West-Front; &amp; of Edw: 3<span class="super">d</span> in the Choir, &amp; great Tower.
      </p>
      <p>Is there any difference in the building of y<span class="super">e</span> Lady-Choir, &amp; the ornaments bestow'd upon it?
      </p>
      <p>Pray, be particular in describing the parts of this Cathedral, w<span class="super">ch</span> (as I remember) is the great School of the Goths.
      </p>
      <p>There was a building of Edw: 4<span class="super">th's</span> reign (call'd S<span class="super">t</span> William's College) for the Chantry-Priests near this Church. where is it now, &amp; what
         other old Fragments remain of Cloisters, Palace, &amp;c: go into the Vaults under the
         Choir, if you can.
