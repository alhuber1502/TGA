            <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>The best piece of news I have to send you is, that Mason is Residentiary of York, wch is worth near
					200£ a-year: he owes it to our Friend Mr F: Montagu, who is Brother-in-Law to Dean Fountayne. the Precentorship (worth as much more) being vacant at the same time, Ld H: has obtain'd that too for him: but for this he must come &amp; kiss hands; &amp; as the ceremony is not yet over, we do not
					proclaim it aloud for the present. he now (I think) may wait for Mr Hutton's exit with great
					patience, &amp; shut his insatiable repining mouth. I hope to see him here in his way to Town.</p>
         <p>I pity your Brother, &amp; have little hope left of his Wife's recovery: tho' I have been told that
					Dr Lowth's, after she had continued for some years in that condition, was perfectly restored. it may
					be worth while to enquire in what method she was treated. the papers were to have been sent to
					Boswel-Court the week after I left London to be seen before they were pack'd up. Mr Jonathan is perhaps unable to attend to it, but
					doubtless you have order'd somebody to hasten Bromwich, &amp; see that the sorts are right. I shall not be at London till the middle of
						March. My old Friend Miss Speed has done what the World calls a
					very foolish thing. she has married the Baron de la Peyriere, Son
					to the Sardinian Minister, the Comte de Viry. he is about 28 years old, (ten years younger than
						herself) but looks nearer 40. this is not the effect of debauchery, for he is a very sober Man;
					good-natured &amp; honest, &amp; no Conjurer. the estate of the family is about 4000£ a-year. the
					Castle of Viry is in Savoy a few miles from Geneva, commanding a fine view of the Lake. what she has done with her money, I know not:
					but (I suspect) kept it to herself. her religion she need not change, but she must never expect to be
					well-received at that Court, till she does; &amp; I do not think she will make quite a <hi rend="italic">Julie</hi> in the
						country.
				</p>
         <p>The Heloïse cruelly disappointed me, but it has its Partisans, among wch are Mason &amp; Mr Hurd.
					for me I admire nothing but Fingal (I conclude, you have read it: if not, Stonhewer can lend it you)
					yet I remain still in doubt about the authenticity of those poems, tho' inclining rather to believe them genuine in spite of the World.
					whether they are the inventions of antiquity, or of a modern Scotchman, either case is to me alike unaccountable. je m'y pers.</p>
         <p>I take no joy in the Spanish War, being too old to privateer, &amp; too poor to buy stock; nor do I hope for a good end of any war, as it will be now probably conducted. oh that foolishest of Great
					Men, that sold his inestimable diamond for a paltry peerage &amp; pension: the very night it happen'd
					was I swearing, that it was a damn'd lie, &amp; never could be: but it was for want of reading Thomas a Kempis, who knew Mankind so much better, than I.</p>
         <p>Young Pitt (whom I believe you have heard me mention) is return'd to England: from him I hope to
					get much information concerning Spain, wch no body has seen: he is no bad Observer. I saw a Man yesterday, who has been atop of M:
					Ætna, &amp; seen the ruins of a Temple at Agrigentum, whose Columns (when standing) were 96 feet in
					height: a moderate Man might hide himself in one of the flutings. by the way there is a Mr Phelps
					(now gone Secretary with the Embassy to Turin) who has been all over Sicily, &amp; means to give us an account of its remains. there
					are two more volumes of Buffon (the 9th &amp; 10th) arrived in England; &amp; the two last Maps of
						D'anville's Europe. one Mr Needham, Tutor to a Ld
						Gormanstown now on his travels, has made a strange discovery. he saw a figure of Isis at Turin, on
					whose back was a pilaster of antique characters, not hieroglyphicks, but such as are sometimes seen on Egyptian statues. when he came
					to Rome, in the Vatican Library he was shew'd a Glossary of the ancient Chinese tongue. he was struck with the similitude of the
					characters, &amp; on comparing them with an exact copy he had of the inscription, found that he could read it, &amp; that it signified,
					| This Statue of Isis is copied from another in such a City: the original is so many measures in height, &amp; so many in
						breadth.| if this be true, it may open many new things to us. Deguignes some time ago wrote a dissertation to prove, that China was peopled from Egypt. </p>
         <p>I still flatter myself with the notion of seeing you in Summer: but God knows, how it will be. I am persuading Mr Brown to make a
					visit to Lady Strathmore (who has often invited him) &amp; then you will see him too: he is at
					present not very well, having something of the Sciatica, wch hangs about him.</p>
