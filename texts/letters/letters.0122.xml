         <p>Without any preface I come to your verses, which I read over and over with excessive pleasure, and
					which are at least as good as Propertius. I am only sorry you follow the blunders of Broukhusius, all
					whose insertions are nonsense. I have some objections to your antiquated words, and am also an enemy to Alexandrines; at least I do not
					like them in Elegy. I like your Elegy extremely, so extremely, that I long to shew you some little errors you are fallen into by
					following Broukhusius: for example, your thirty first lines are most intelligibly soft and pretty: but pray what sense do you affix to
					your six Broukhusian lines, that begin at happy youth and end at â€“ let me die? [...] Were I
					with you now, and Propertius with your verses lay upon the table between us, I could discuss this point in a moment; but there is
					nothing so tiresome as spinning out a criticism in a letter; doubts arise, and explanations follow, till there swells out at least a
					volume of undigested observations: and all because you are not with him whom you want to convince. Read only the letters between Pope
					and Cromwell in proof of this; they dispute without end. Are you aware now that I have an interest all
					this while in banishing Criticism from our correspondence? Indeed I have; for I am going to write down a little Ode (if it deserves the
					name) for your perusal, which I am afraid will hardly stand that test. Nevertheless I leave you at your full liberty; so here it
					follows.</p>
         <q>
            <p>ODE.</p>
            <p>Dear Gray, that always in my heart <lb/> Possessest far the better part, <lb/> What mean these sudden blasts that rise <lb/> And
						drive the Zephyrs from the skies? <lb/> O join with mine thy tuneful lay, <lb/> And invocate the tardy May. </p>
            <p>Come, fairest Nymph, resume thy reign! <lb/> Bring all the Graces in thy train! <lb/> With balmy breath, and flowery tread, <lb/>
						Rise from thy soft ambrosial bed; <lb/> Where, in elysian slumber bound, <lb/> Embow'ring myrtles veil thee round. </p>
            <p>Awake, in all thy glories drest, <lb/> Recall the Zephyrs from the west; <lb/> Restore the sun, revive the skies, <lb/> At mine,
						and Nature's call, arise! <lb/> Great Nature's self upbraids thy stay, <lb/> And misses her accustom'd May. </p>
            <p>See! all her works demand thy aid; <lb/> The labours of Pomona fade: <lb/> A plaint is heard from ev'ry tree; <lb/> Each budding
						flow'ret calls for thee; <lb/> The Birds forget to love and sing; <lb/> With storms alone the forests ring. </p>
            <p>Come then, with Pleasure at thy side, <lb/> Diffuse thy vernal spirit wide; <lb/> Create, where'er thou turn'st thy eye, <lb/>
						Peace, Plenty, Love, and Harmony; <lb/> Till ev'ry being share its part, <lb/> And Heav'n and Earth be glad at heart.</p>
