      <p>Not knowing whether you are yet returned from your seawater, I write at random to
         you. For me, I am come to my resting place, and find it very necessary, after living
         for a month in a house with three women<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that laughed from morning to night, and would allow nothing to the sulkiness of my
         disposition. Company and cards at home, parties by land and water abroad,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and (what they call) <span style="font-style:italic">doing something,</span> that is, racketting about from morning to night, are occupations, I find, that wear
         out my spirits, especially in a situation where one might sit still, and be alone
         with pleasure; for the place was a hill like Clifden,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> opening to a very extensive and diversified landscape, with the Thames, which is
         navigable, running at its foot.</p>
      <p>I would wish to continue here (in a very different scene, it must be confessed) till
         Michaelmas; but I fear I must come to town much sooner. Cambridge is a delight of
         a place, now there is nobody in it. I do believe you would like it, if you knew what
         it was without inhabitants. It is they, I assure you, that get it an ill name and
         spoil all. Our friend Dr. Chapman<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (one of its nuisances) is not expected here again in a hurry. He is gone to his grave
         with five fine mackerel (large and full of roe) in his belly. He eat them all at one
         dinner; but his fate was a turbot<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on Trinity Sunday, of which he left little for the company besides bones. He had
         not been hearty all the week; but after this sixth fish he never held up his head
         more, and a violent looseness carried him off. â€“ They say he made a very good end.</p>
      <p>Have you seen the Erse Fragments<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> since they were printed? I am more puzzled than ever about their antiquity, though
         I still incline (against everybody's opinion) to believe them old. Those you have
         already seen are the best; though there are some others that are excellent too.</p>
