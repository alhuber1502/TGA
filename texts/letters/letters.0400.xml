         <p>Your letter has rejoiced me (as you will easily believe) &amp; agreeably disappointed me. I congratulate you in the first place;
					&amp; am very glad to see, the College have had the spirit &amp; the sense to do a thing so much to their credit, &amp; to do it in a
					handsome manner. my best service to Mr Lyon, &amp; tell him it will be a great disobligation, if my Lady takes him away to pass the Christmas with her, just when I am proposing to visit him in his new capacity. I hope to be with you in about a week, but will write again before I come: do persuade Mr Delaval to stay:
					tell him, I will say any thing he pleases of Mr P:
				</p>
         <p>Have you read the Negotiations? (I speak not to Mr Del:, but to you) the French have certainly done Mr P: service in publishing them.
					the spirit &amp; contempt he has shewn in his treatment of Bussy's proposals, whether right or wrong, will go near to restore him to
					his popularity, &amp; almost make up for the disgrace of the pension. my Ld T: is outrageous: he
					makes no scruple of declaring, that the D: of N: &amp; Ld B: were the persons, whose frequent
					opposition in Council were the principal cause of this resignation. he has (as far as he could) disinherited his Brother G: Gr:lle that
					is, of about 4000Â£ a-year, his Father's estate. &amp; yesterday he made a very strange speech in the House, that surprised every body.
					the particulars I can not yet hear with certainty. but the D: of Bedford replied to it. did you
					observe a <hi rend="italic">very bold</hi> letter in the Gazetteer of Thursday last about <hi rend="italic">Carr, Earl of Somerset</hi>? how do you like the K:s Speech? it is Ld Hardwick's. how
					do you like Hogarth's Perriwigs? I suppose, you have discover'd the last face in the rank of
					Peeresses to be a very great personage, extremely like; tho' you never saw her. Good night!</p>
