				     <p>You have reason to call me negligent, nor have I any thing to alledge in my own defence, but two successive fits of the gout, wch
					tho' weakly &amp; not severe, were at least dispiriting, &amp; lasted a long time. I rejoiced to hear your alarms for Robin &amp; Kitty ended so happily, &amp; with them (I hope), are fled a great
					part of your future inquietudes on their account. in the summer I flatter myself we may all meet in health once more at Old-Park, &amp;
					a part of us perhaps at the foot of Skiddaw. I am to call Mason in my way, &amp; bring him with me to visit his own works. Mr Brown admitted your Nephew according to your orders, &amp; will provide
					him with a room against October.</p>
				     <p>I do not guess, what intelligence St: gave you about my employments: but the worst employment I have had has been to write something
					for musick against the D: of G: comes to Cambridge. I must comfort myself with the intention: for I
					know it will bring abuse enough on me. however it is done, &amp; given to the V: Chancellor, &amp;
					there is an end. I am come to Town for a fortnight, &amp; find every thing in extreme confusion, as
					you may guess from your news-papers: nothing but force threaten'd on both sides, &amp; the Law (as usual) watching the event &amp;
					ready to side with the strongest. the only good thing I hear is, that France is on the brink of a general bankrupcy, &amp; their fleet
					(the only thing they have laid out money on of late) in no condition of service. </p>
				     <p>The Spring is come in all its beauty, &amp; for two or three days I am going to meet it at Windsor. Adieu &amp; let us pray it may
					continue till July. remember me to Mrs Wharton &amp; all the family.</p>
