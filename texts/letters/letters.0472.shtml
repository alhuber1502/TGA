      </div>
      <p>I am very much obliged to you for the detail you enter into on the subject of your
         own health: in this you cannot be too circumstantial for me, who had received no account
         of you, but at second hand â&#x80;&#x93; such as, that you were dangerously ill, and therefore
         went to France; that you meant to try a better climate, and therefore staid at Paris;
         that you had relapsed, and were confined to your bed, and extremely in vogue, and
         supped in the best company, and were at all public diversions. I rejoice to find (improbable
         as it seemed) that all the wonderful part of this is strictly true, and that the serious
         part has been a little exaggerated. This latter I conclude not so much from your own
         account of yourself, as from the spirits in which I see you write; and long may they
         continue to support you! I mean in a reasonable degree of elevation: but if (take
         notice) they are so volatile, so flippant, as to suggest any of those doctrines of
         health, which you preach with all the zeal of a French atheist; at least, if they
         really do influence your practice; I utterly renounce them and all their works. They
         are <span style="font-style:italic">evil spirits,</span> and will lead you to destruction. â&#x80;&#x93; You have long built your hopes on temperance,
         you say, and hardiness. On the first point we are agreed. The second has totally disappointed
         you, and <span style="font-style:italic">therefore</span> you will persist in it; by all means. But then be sure to persist too in being young,
         in stopping the course of time, and making the shadow return back upon your sun-dial.
         If you find this not so easy, acquiesce with a good grace in my <span style="font-style:italic">anilities,</span> put on your understockings of yarn or woollen, even in the night-time. Don't provoke
         me! or I shall order you two night-caps (which by the way would do your eyes good),
         and put a little of any French liqueur into your water: they are nothing but brandy
         and sugar, and among their various flavours some of them may surely be palatable enough.
         The pain in your feet I <span style="font-style:italic">can</span> bear; but I shudder at the sickness in your stomach, and the weakness, that still
         continues. I conjure you, as you love yourself; I conjure you by Strawberry, not to
         trifle with these edge-tools. There is no cure for the gout, when in the stomach,
         but to throw it into the limbs. There is no relief for the gout in the limbs, but
         in gentle warmth and gradual perspiration.</p>
      <p>I was much entertained with your account of our neighbours. As an Englishman and an
         Antigallican, I rejoice at their dulness and their nastiness: though I fear we shall
         come to imitate them in both. Their atheism is a little too much, too shocking to
         rejoice at. I have been long sick at it in their authors, and hated them for it: but
         I pity their poor innocent people of fashion. They were bad enough, when they believed
         every thing! </p>
      <p>I have searched where you directed me; which I could not do sooner, as I was at London
         when I received your letter, and could not easily find her grace's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> works. Here they abound in every library. The print you ask after is the frontispiece
         to <span style="font-style:italic">Nature's pictures drawn by Fancy's pencil.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> But lest there should be any mistake, I must tell you, the family are not at dinner,
         but sitting round a rousing fire and telling stories. The room is just such a one
         as we lived in at Rheims:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I mean as to the glazing and ceiling. The chimney is supported by cariatides: over
         the mantle-piece the arms of the family. The duke and duchess are crowned with laurel.
         A servant stands behind him, holding a hat and feather. Another is shutting a window.
         Diepenbecke delin. &amp; (I think) S. Clouwe<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> sculps. It is a very pretty and curious print, and I thank you for the sight of it.
         If it ever was a picture, what a picture to have!</p>
      <p>I must tell you, that upon cleaning an old picture here at St. John's Lodge, which
         I always took for a Holbein;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on a ring, which the figure wears, they have found H. H. It has been always called
         [Bp] Fisher;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but is plainly a layman, and probably sir Anthony Denny,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who was a benefactor to the college.</p>
      <p>What is come of your SevignÃ©-curiosity?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I should be glad of a line now and then, when you have leisure.</p>
