      <p>Perhaps You have not yet hang'd yourself!<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when you do (as doubtless you must be thinking of it) be so good as to give me a
         day or two's notice, that I may be a little prepared. yet who knows? possibly your
         education at St John's (in conjunction with the Bp of Glr:)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> may suggest to you, that the <span style="font-style:italic">naked Indian,</span> that found Pitt's diamond,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> made no bad bargain, when he sold it for three oyster-shells, &amp; a Pompon of glass-beads
         to stick in his Wife's hair! if so, you may live, &amp; read on.

      <p>Last week I had an application from a broken Tradesman (whose Wife I knew) to desire
         my interest with the D: of Newcastle for a Tide-Waiter's place; &amp; he adds, <span style="font-style:italic">Sr, your speedy compliance with this, will greatly oblige all our Family.</span> this morning, before I was up, Dr Moreton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of the Mus√¶um call'd here &amp; left the inclosed note.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he is a mighty civil Man, for the rest you know him full as well as I do; &amp; I insist
         that you return me a civil answer. I do not insist, that you should get him the Mastership:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on the contrary I desire (as any body would in such a case) that you will get it
         for yourself; as I intend, when I hear it is vacant, to have the Tidewaiter's place,
         if I miss of the Privy-Seal,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Cofferership.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
