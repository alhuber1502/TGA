					       <salute>My dear Wharton</salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>A little kind of Reproach, that I saw the other Day in a Letter of yours to Mr Brown, has made my Guilt fly in my Face, &amp; given
					me Spirit to be a Beast no longer. I desired him to tell you in the beginning of the Summer, that I fear'd my Journey into the North
					would be prevented by the Arrival of my Cousin, Mrs Forster (whom you remember by the Name of
					Pattinson) from India. she came in August; &amp; I continued in Town with her a Month in order to do what little Services I could to a
					Person as strange, &amp; as much to seek, as tho' she had been born in the Mud of the Ganges. after this the Year was too far advanced
					to undertake such an Expedition; &amp; the Thought of seeing you here in the Spring in some measure
					comforts me for the Disappointment; for I depend upon your coming then, when it will be far easier to confer together, &amp; determine
					about a Thing, in wch (I fear) I am too much interes[ted to deserve having] any great share in the
						Determination: for [ ]</p>
				     <p> People. you are aware undoubtedly, that a certain Deference, not to say Servility, to the Heads of Colleges is perhaps necessary to
					a Physician, that means to establish himself here: you possibly may find a Method to do without it. another Inconvenience your Wife,
					rather than you, will feel, the Want of Company of her own Sex; as the Women are few here, squeezy &amp; formal, and little skill'd in
					amusing themselves or other People. all I can say is, she must try to make up for it among the Men, who are not over-agreeable neither.
					I much approve of your settling seriously to your Profession; but as your Father is old, if you should lose him, what becomes of your
					Interest, &amp; to whom is it then to be transfer'd? would you leave London &amp; your Practise again to canvas an Election for
						yourself? it seems to me, that, if you execute your present Scheme, you must (in case of Mr
						Wh:n's Death) entirely lay aside all Views of that Kind. the gradual Transition you propose to make
					thro' Bath or Cambridge to London is very well judged, &amp; likely enough to succeed. for Bath, I am wholly unacquainted with it,
					&amp; consequently can say little to the Purpose. the Way of Life there might be more amusing to Mrs Wharton, than this; but to You, I
					think, would be less satisfactory. I sincerely congratulate you on the good Effects of your new Medecine, wch is indeed a sufficient
					Recompence for any Pains you have taken in that Study. but to make a just Tryal of its Efficacy &amp; of your own Constitution, you
					certainly ought to pass a little Time at London (a Month or so) &amp; that [ ] engaged himself to
					make it up 1000Â£, in case the Brothers will not do it, &amp; they have (after some Hesitation) refused it. our good Mr Brown goes out of his Office today, of wch he is not a little
					glad. his College, wch had much declined for some time, is picking up again: they have had twelve Admissions this Year; &amp; are just
					filling up two Fellowships with a Mr Cardell, whom I do not know, but they say, he is a good Scholar;
					&amp; a Mr Delaval, a Fellow-Commoner (a younger Son to old Delaval
					of Northumberland) who has taken his Degree in an exemplary Manner, &amp; is very sensible, &amp; knowing. the Appeal, wch has been so long contended for, will, I believe, at last be yielded to with a good Grace, or rather
					bestowed, by the Advice of the D: of N:, &amp; my Lord Ch:r, &amp; will be the best &amp; most
					popular Thing they can do, but you must not mention it, till it is actually done. I am sorry your friend Chapman will lose all the
					Merit of his Pamphlet, wch (by the Way) has been answer'd exceedingly well, &amp; with all due
						Contempt. he seems much mortified, &amp; was preparing a Reply; but this Event, I doubt, will cut
					him short.
				</p>
				     <p>I know of nothing new in the literary Way, but the History of Lewis, 14th, by Voltaire; not that I
					have yet seen it but my Expectations are much raised.</p>

					       <salute>Adieu, my dear Wharton, I am ever<lb/> Most truly Yours </salute>
					       <signed>T G. </signed>
				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p>P:S: I am ready to pay my Debts, if you will tell me to whom. my Compliments &amp; good Wishes to Mrs Wharton, &amp; the little
						Gentry. </p>
