      <p>I own in general I think Agrippina's speech too long; but how to retrench it, I know
         not: But I have something else to say, and that is in relation to the style, which
         appears to me too antiquated. Racine was of another opinion; he no where gives you
         the phrases of Ronsard: His language is the language of the times, and that of the
         purest sort; so that his French is reckoned a standard. I will not decide what style
         is fit for our English stage; but I should rather choose one that bordered upon Cato,
         than upon Shakespear. One may imitate (if one can) Shakespear's manner, his surprizing
         strokes of true nature, his expressive force in painting characters, and all his other
         beauties; preserving at the same time our own language. Were Shakespear alive now,
         he would write in a different style from what he did. These are my sentiments upon
         these matters: Perhaps I am wrong, for I am neither a Tarpa, nor am I quite an Aristarchus.
         You see I write freely both of you and Shakespear; but it is as good as writing not
         freely, where you know it is acceptable.

      <p>I have been tormented within this week with a most violent cough; for when once it
         sets up its note, it will go on, cough after cough, shaking and tearing me for half
         an hour together; and then it leaves me in a great sweat, as much fatigued as if I
         had been labouring at the plough. All this description of my cough in prose, is only
         to introduce another description of it in verse, perhaps not worth your perusal; but
         it is very short, and besides has this remarkable in it, that it was the production
         of four o'clock in the morning, while I lay in my bed tossing and coughing, and all
         unable to sleep. —

         <p>Ante omnes morbos importunissima tussis, <br /> Quâ durare datur, traxitque sub ilia vires: <br /> Dura etenim versans imo sub pectore regna, <br /> Perpetuo exercet teneras luctamine costas, <br /> Oraque distorquet, vocemque immutat anhelam: <br /> Nec cessare locus: sed saevo concita motu <br /> Molle domat latus, &amp; corpus labor omne fatigat: <br /> Unde molesta dies, noctemque insomnia turbant. <br /> Nec Tua, si mecum Comes hic jucundus adesses, <br /> Verba juvare queant, aut hunc lenire dolorem <br /> Sufficiant tua vox dulcis, nec vultus amatus.

      <p>Do not mistake me, I do not condemn Tacitus: I was then inclined to find him tedious:
         The German sedition sufficiently made up for it; and the speech of Germanicus, by
         which he reclaims his soldiers, is quite masterly. Your New Dunciad I have no conception
         of. I shall be too late for our dinner if I write any more.
