         <div class="dateline">Turin, Nov. 16, N. S. 1739. </div>
      </div>
      <p>After eight days journey through Greenland, we arrived at Turin. You approach it by
         a handsome avenue of nine miles long, and quite strait. The entrance is guarded by
         certain vigilant dragons, called Douaniers, who mumbled us for some time. The city
         is not large, as being a place of strength, and consequently confined within its fortifications;
         it has many beauties and some faults; among the first are streets all laid out by
         the line, regular uniform buildings, fine walks that surround the whole, and in general
         a good lively clean appearance: But the houses are of brick plaistered, which is apt
         to want repairing; the windows of oiled paper, which is apt to be torn; and every
         thing very slight, which is apt to tumble down. There is an excellent Opera, but it
         is only in the Carnival: Balls every night, but only in the Carnival: Masquerades,
         too, but only in the Carnival. This Carnival lasts only from Christmas to Lent; one
         half of the remaining part of the year is passed in remembering the last, the other
         in expecting the future Carnival. We cannot well subsist upon such slender diet, no
         more than upon an execrable Italian Comedy, and a Puppet-Show, called Rappresentazione
         d'un' anima dannata, which, I think, are all the present diversions of the place;
         except the Marquise de Cavaillac's Conversazione, where one goes to see people play
         at Ombre and Taroc,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a game with 72 cards all painted with suns, and moons, and devils and monks. Mr.
         Walpole has been at court; the family are at present at a country palace, called La
         Venerie. The palace here in town is the very quintessence of gilding and looking-glass;
         inlaid floors, carved pannels, and painting, wherever they could stick a brush. I
         own I have not, as yet, any where met with those grand and simple works of Art, that
         are to amaze one, and whose sight one is to be the better for: But those of Nature
         have astonished me beyond expression. In our little journey up to the Grande Chartreuse,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I do not remember to have gone ten paces without an exclamation, that there was no
         restraining: Not a precipice, not a torrent, not a cliff, but is pregnant with religion
         and poetry. There are certain scenes that would awe an atheist into belief, without
         the help of other argument. One need not have a very fantastic imagination to see
         spirits there at noon-day: You have Death perpetually before your eyes, only so far
         removed, as to compose the mind without frighting it. I am well persuaded St. Bruno
         was a man of no common genius, to choose such a situation for his retirement; and
         perhaps should have been a disciple of his, had I been born in his time. You may believe
         Abelard and Heloïse were not forgot upon this occasion: If I do not mistake, I saw
         you too every now and then at a distance among the trees; il me semble, que j'ai vu
         ce chien de visage là quelque part. You seemed to call to me from the other side of
         the precipice, but the noise of the river below was so great, that I really could
         not distinguish what you said; it seemed to have a cadence like verse. In your next
         you will be so good to let me know what it was. The week we have since passed among
         the Alps, has not equalled the single day upon that mountain, because the winter was
         rather too far advanced, and the weather a little foggy. However, it did not want
         its beauties; the savage rudeness of the view is inconceivable without seeing it:
         I reckoned in one day, thirteen cascades, the least of which was, I dare say, one
         hundred feet in height. I had Livy in the chaise with me, and beheld his 'Nives cœlo
         propè immistæ, tecta informia imposita rupibus, pecora jumentaque torrida frigore,
         homines intonsi &amp; inculti, animalia inanimaque omnia rigentia gelu; omnia confragosa,
         præruptaque'.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> The creatures that inhabit them are, in all respects, below humanity; and most of
         them, especially women, have the tumidum guttur,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which they call goscia. Mont Cenis, I confess, carries the permission mountains have
         of being frightful<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> rather too far; and its horrors were accompanied with too much danger to give one
         time to reflect upon their beauties. There is a family of the Alpine monsters I have
         mentioned, upon its very top, that in the middle of winter calmly lay in their stock
         of provisions and firing, and so are buried in their hut for a month or two under
         the snow. When we were down it, and got a little way into Piedmont, we began to find
         'Apricos quosdam colles, rivosque prope sylvas, &amp; jam humano cultu digniora loca'.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I read Silius Italicus too, for the first time; and wished for you according to custom.
         We set out for Genoa in two days time.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
