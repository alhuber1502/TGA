      <p>For my part I will stick to my credulity, and if I am cheated, think it worse for
         him [the translator] than for me. The Epic Poem is foolishly so called, yet there
         is a sort of plan and unity in it very strange for a barbarous age; yet what I more
         admire are some of the detached pieces – the rest I leave to the discussion of antiquarians
         and historians; yet my curiosity is much interested in their decision. </p>
