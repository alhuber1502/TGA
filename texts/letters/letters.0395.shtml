      <p>I hope to send you the first intelligence of the church preferments, tho' such is
         your eagerness there for this sort of news, that perhaps mine may be stale before
         it can reach you. Drummond is Ap of York, Hayter Bp of London, Young of Norwich, Newton
         of Bristol with the Residentp of St Paul's, Thomas goes to Salisbury, Greene (of Ben'et)
         to Lincoln, James Yorke succeeds to his Deanery.

      <p>As to the Queene why you have all seen her, what need I tell you that she is thin,
         and not tall, fine clear light brown hair (not very light neither) very white teeth,
         mouth â€”, nose strait and well formed, turned up a little at the end, nostrils rather
         wide, complexion a little inclining to yellow, but little colour; dark and not large
         eyes, hand and arm not perfect, very genteel motions, great spirits, and much conversation.
         She speaks French very correctly. This is all I know, but do not cite me for it.

      <p>Mason is come, but I have not seen him: he walks at the Coronation. I shall see the
         shew, but whether in the Hall, or only the Procession I do not know yet. It is believed
         places will be cheap.
