      </div>
      <p>When the belly is full, the bones are at rest. you squat yourself down in the midst
         of your revenues, leave me to suppose, that somebody has broke in upon the Dean before
         you; that Mr Beedon has siezed upon the Precentorship; that you are laid up with a
         complication of distempers at York; that you are dead of an Apoplexy at Aston, &amp; all
         the disagreeable probabilities, that use to befall us, when we think ourselves at
         the height of our wishes; and then away you are gone to Town, while I am daily expecting
         you here; &amp; the first I know of it is from the Gazette. why, if you were Bishop of
         Lincoln, you could not serve one worse!
      </p>
      <p>I wrote to you the same day I received your letter, the 11th of Jan:; &amp; then to Dr
         Wharton, who sends you his congratulations to be deliver'd in your way to London.
         here, take them, you miserable Precentor! I wish all your Choir may mutiny, &amp; sing
         you to death.
      </p>
