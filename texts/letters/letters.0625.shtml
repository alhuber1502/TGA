      </div>
      <p>Yesterday I received a letter from De Bonstetten, crammed fuller than it could hold,
         and containing besides two little after-thoughts, one three inches by two, the other
         two by one, which flew out when I opened the letter like the oracles of the Sybil.
         But I like this much better than any I have received; he intreats us a deux genoux
         to come, and I you in the same posture and with equal earnestness; if he does not
         esteem me he is an idiot to take so much pains to persuade me to believe it, because,
         if he were false, I see no end that it could answer to make a dupe of me at the expense
         of so much labour and unnecessary dissimulation. He promises, if we come, that he
         will visit us in England the summer following. Let us go then, my dear Mr. Gray, and
         leave low thoughted care<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at the foot of the mountains, for the air above is too pure for it. During the winter,
         my wandering inclinations are quiet in their hybernacula; but these two or three last
         glorious days succeeding the rigour of such an unusual season, have awakened them;
         the animal and vegetable world rejoice, and every thing that has life in it begins
         to shew it. I have lived in the air (being fortunately compelled to attend my garden
         myself) except during dinner, &amp;c. The effect of this and De Bonstetten's letter is,
         that I find something 'che mi sprona'<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> invincibly to go to Switzerland this summer. A deux genoux, I again intreat you to
         go with me. To-day, as I sat at breakfast in a room without sun, I felt myself in
         prison, and the world abroad appeared to me not a reality, but some golden vision
         raised by enchantment. The moment the windows were flung up, an earthly smell came
         in, exhaled by the sun from the loose and fermenting mould of the garden and fields.
         'In those vernal seasons of the year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an
         injury and sullenness against nature not to go out and see her riches, and partake
         in her rejoicing with heaven and earth.'<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I am not so sullen; I do partake with her, and feel that this is a natural joy, which
         confesses its origin by being sincere and unmixed, and by leaving no bitterness on
         the palate behind it; but, on the contrary, opens, dilates, and warms the heart. I
         really find myself as inclined to pray, in such a day as this, as Petrarch was on
         the summit of the mountain.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Pardon this rant, which, though I felt, I ought perhaps to have repressed. The burthen
         of the song is, 'Go to Switzerland with me, I beseech you.' In the mean time, for
         I have not a moment to lose, I shall venture to bespeak a curate from the first of
         June to the last of October, and consider of ways and means for a supply adequate
         to my great occasions: but I will go, though twenty St. Gothards were in the way.
         The geometra fasciaria, I think (ignorant, alas! that I was an enemy of the LinnÃ¦an
         faction) flew against me in the twilight yesterday evening; otherwise I have found
         but few insects yet. I have some larvÃ¦ in boxes, that I met with under the roots
         of plants. The mosses require too painful an attention without an instructor, so I
         shall wait for one. I have looked at a few common birds, and this is all. The rest
         of my time has been taken up with Froissart, Guicciardini, &amp;c. I am still reading
         the latter, and extracting from the former. A thousand thanks for your letter, full
         of information, but giving me a curiosity to see books that I cannot get here. Pray
         what were the heralds, who seem to have been so liberally rewarded, and called in
         with the minstrels at great entertainments, as well as employed in carrying defiances,
         &amp;c. What is the difference between banniÃ¨re and pennon?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> each principal commander (but these are vague words) seems to have marched with a
         banniÃ¨re peculiar to him, on which his arms were painted, and a pennon seems inferior.
         I have put the story of the Irish Kings,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> from Froissart, into English; and am now gathering many scattered curiosities relating
         to the manners of the Scotch in that age. I am besides reading at odd times Hall's
         Chronicle,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and my mother and I have just begun the second volume of Robertson's Charles the
         Fifth, because we know something about him already from Rapin and Lord Herbert, and
         I from Guicciardin. I long for a book often quoted by Lord Herbert, and that should
         be curious; Sandoval<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> especially, as I can now read Spanish pretty easily, for I have finished Don Quixote.
         Temple desires a plan for modern history,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> not confined to any particular period, but beginning as early as you think proper,
         and continued as late;â&#x80;&#x93; if you think this an immodest request, you may do as much
         or as little of it as you please; but whatever you may do will be a kindness to him
         (whose only consolation consists in his books and a few friends who wish him well,
         without being able to do more) and received with great joy and gratitude. I believe
         my house will be continued to me on the present footing.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> De Bonstetten in one of the flying scraps says, 'M. Freundenrich<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> mon ami qui est dans votre pays cherche quelque homme de Lettres qui veuille le prendre
         en pension pour cet EtÃ©.â&#x80;&#x93;Vous ferez quelque chose de ce pauvre homme, il a des
         talens, son education a Ã©tÃ© nÃ©gligÃ©. Je vous supplie de vous interesser Ã  cette
         affaire.' But by what means? For he has not told me where he is to be found; nor do
         I perfectly understand what le prendre en pension means. Is it that he would board
         with some one who would instruct him in English and other matters? Perhaps M. Freundenrich
         is a person that he has mentioned to you, and thinks I know him of course. Do you
         know a book that De Bonstetten recommends to me, Danielis EremitÃ¦ Vita,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c. with a voyage to Switzerland at the end? Pray let me hear soon. My mother's compliments.
         The post is forbid to send letters cross.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
