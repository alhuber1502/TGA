      </div>
      <p>You may well suppose me no longer here, as I have neglected thus long to answer two
         very kind letters, &amp; (wch is more) to congratulate you on what most of your friends
         regard as a very happy event: but to me, I own, it has another face, as I have a much
         greater regard for you than for the young Gentleman, whom I never saw; &amp; foresee,
         that from this time you will never part with your bottle, wch is properly the father
         of this boy. all my rhetorick will be thrown away, the Gout may groan at you, &amp; brandish
         its crutches, the Stone rattle, &amp; the Palsy shake its head unheeded. we shall be no
         match for Claret, if it can get an heir, as well as carry an election. now I talk
         of elections, we have a report here that your friend Mr V: (I mean Ld Barnard) means
         to bring in his Son-in-law at Durham. is this true? H: Vane sets out for the North
         on Saturday, so I suppose the Bishop's entry will be over next week. and next Monday
         fortnight I hope to set out myself with Stonhewer, who is going down to his fathers,
         in a Post-chaise. we shall not come very fast, as I propose to see Burleigh, Bevoir-Castle,
         &amp;c: by the way. but I shall write again before I come, to tell you exactly what day
         we shall be at York. if the time does not suit you, you will inform me as soon as
         possible. I did not run away from his Grace, but follow'd your advice, had a very
         affectionate squeeze by the hand, &amp; a fine Complement in a corner. many people here
         have been curious to know what it was; but I have kept my own secret, for indeed I
         do not know myself: only I remember it felt warm, &amp; sweated a little. Adieu! you will
         not fail to present my Complements to Mrs Wharton. if she drank as much Claret, as
         you have done, we shall have the Boy <span style="font-style:italic">stand</span> for the County, as soon as he can walk alone. Mr Brown (I believe) will be engaged
         here with Plummer greatest part of the Summer: [he and Tuthill] desire to be remember'd
         to you both.
