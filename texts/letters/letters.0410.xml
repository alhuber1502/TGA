					       <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I send your Reverence the lesson, wch is pure good-nature on my part, knowing already as I do, that
					you don't like it. no sooner do people feel their income increase than they want amusement! why what need have you of any other, than
					to sit like a Japonese Divinity with your hands folded on your fat belly wrap'd &amp; (as it were) annihilated in the contemplation of
					your own <hi rend="italic">corpses</hi>
					 and revenues? the Pentagrapher is gone to Town, so you have
					nothing to do but to go &amp; multiply in your own vulgar way: only don't fall to work, &amp; forget to say grace.</p>
				     <p>The Laureat has honour'd me, (as a Friend of yours, for I know no other reason) with his new
						Play &amp; his Charge to the Poets, the first very middleing; the
					second I am pleased with, chiefly with the sense, &amp; sometimes with the verse &amp; expression: and yet the best thing he ever wrote
					was that Elegy against Friendship you once shew'd me, where the sense was detestable; so that you see
					it is not at all necessary a Poet should be a good sort of Man, no, not even in his writings. Bob Lloyd has publish'd his works in a just quarto volume, containing among other things a Latin
					Translation of my Elegy; an Epistle in wch is a very serious compliment to me by name, particularly
					on my Pindaric accomplishments; &amp; the very two Odes you saw before, in which we were
						abused; &amp; a note to say, they were written in concert with his Friend Mr Coleman: so little
					value have poets for themselves, especially when they would make up a just volume. Mr Delap is here
					&amp; has brought his cub to Trinity. he has pick'd up again purely since his misfortune, &amp; is fat &amp; well, all but a few bowels. he says, Mrs Pritchard
					spoilt his Hecuba with sobbing so much; &amp; that she was really so moved, that she fell in fits
					behind the scenes. I much like Dr Lowth's Grammar: it is concise, clear, &amp; elegant. he has
					selected his Solecisms from all the best Writers of our Tongue. I hear Mr Hurd is seriously writing
					against Fingal by the instigation of the Devil &amp; the B:p. can it be true? I have exhausted all my litterary news, &amp; I have no
					other.</p>

				     <postscript>
					       <p>Mr Brown has got a cap, &amp; hopes for a suitable hood. you must write a line to tell him how to
						send them. I go to Town on Monday, but direct to me here.</p>
