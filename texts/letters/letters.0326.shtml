         <div class="salute">Dear Mason </div>
      </div>
      <p>I should have told you, that Caradoc came safe to hand,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but my critical faculties have been so taken up in dividing <span style="font-style:italic">nothing</span> with the Dragon of Wantley's Dam,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that they are not yet composed enough for a better &amp; more tranquil employment: shortly
         however I will make them obey me; but am I to send this copy to Mr Hurd, or return
         it to you? methinks I do not love this travelling to &amp; again of manuscripts by the
         Post. while I am writing, your second packet is just arrived. I can only tell you
         in gross, that there seem to me certain passages alter'd wch might as well have been
         let alone; &amp; that I shall not be easily reconciled to Mador's <span style="font-style:italic">own</span> song.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I must not have my fancy raised to that agreeable pitch of heathenism, &amp; wild magical
         enthusiasm, &amp; then have you let me drop into moral philosophy, &amp; cold good sense.
         I remember you insulted me, when I saw you last, &amp; affected to call, that wch delighted
         my imagination, <span style="font-style:italic">Nonsense</span>: now I insist, that Sense is nothing in poetry, but according to the dress she wears,
         &amp; the scene she appears in. if you should lead me into a superb Gothic building with
         a thousand cluster'd pillars, each of them half a mile high, the walls all cover'd
         with fretwork, &amp; the windows full of red &amp; blue Saints, that had neither head, nor
         tail; and I should find the Venus of Medici in person perk'd up in a long nich over
         the high altar, as naked as ever she was born, do you think it would raise, or damp
         my devotions? I say, that Mador must be entirely a Briton, &amp; that his preeminence
         among his companions must be shewn by superior wildness, more barbaric fancy, &amp; a
         more striking &amp; deeper harmony both of words &amp; numbers. if British antiquity be too
         narrow, this is the place for Invention, &amp; if it be pure invention, so much the clearer
         must the expression be, &amp; so much the stronger &amp; richer the imagery. there's for you
         now.</p>
      <p>I am sorry to hear you complain of your eyes. have a care of candle-light, &amp; rather
         play at hot-cockles<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with the children, than either read or write.</p>
