         <div class="salute">Dear Sir, </div>
      </div>
      <p>After my fortnight's residence at York, I am arrived here. The Precentor is very hopefully
         improved in dignity; his scarf sets the fullest about his ears: his surplice has the
         most the air of lawn-sleeves you can imagine in so short a time; he begins to complain
         of qualms and indigestions from repose and repletion: in short <span style="font-style:italic">il tranche du Prelat.</span> We went twice a-day to church with our vergers and all our pomp. Here the scene is
         totally altered: we breakfast at six in the morning and go to bed at ten. The house
         rings all day with carpenters and upholsterers, and without doors we swarm with labourers
         and builders. The books are not yet unpacked, and there is but one pen and ink in
         the house. Jetty and Fadge (two favourite sows) are always coming into the entry,
         and there is a concert of poultry under every window: we take in no newspaper or magazine,
         but the cream and butter is beyond compare. You are wished for every day, and you
         may imagine how acceptable a correspondent you must be.
