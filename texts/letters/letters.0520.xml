					       <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p> I and mine are safe, &amp; well, but the chambers opposite to me (Mr. Lyon's) wch were getting
					ready for Mason, are destroy'd. Mr. Brown was in more immediate danger than I; but he too is well,
					&amp; has lost nothing. we owe it to Methodism, that any part (at least of that wing) was preserved: for two Saints, who had been till
					very late at their nocturnal devotions, &amp; were just in bed, gave the first alarm to the college &amp; the town. we had very speedy
					&amp; excellent assistance of engines &amp; men, and are quit for the fright, except the damage abovemention'd. I assure you it is not amusing to be waked between 2 &amp; 3 in the morning &amp; to hear, Don't be
					frighted, Sr! but the college is all of a fire.</p>
				     <p>I have not yet return'd the letters you sent me by the fly, not thinking it necessary to do so
					immediately; but very soon you shall have them. Mason came two days after the fire, &amp; will stay some time.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu! I am sincerely <lb/> Yours </salute>
					       <signed>T G: </signed>
				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p>I do not see, what you can do: everything depends on their first meeting at Mamhead, &amp; that is now over. I am afraid every thing
						will go wrong. it is sure, your last letter could do no hurt. </p>
