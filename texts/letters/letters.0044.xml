         <p>Forgive me, my poor dear Horace, if I intrude upon your Grief, sooner possibly than I ought; yet
					hardly soon enough for the Anxiety I am in upon your account; far from having any such confidence in myself, as to imagine any thing I
					can say should lighten your affliction; I fear your own good Sense, and Resignation to Him, who has spared so long the best of Mothers
					to you, is hardly able to support you under it; I can the easier imagine the Situation you are in from the fears, which are continually
					before my eyes, of a like misfortune in my own case; if that were really to happen, I know not the
					least Shadow of comfort, that could come to me, but what I perhaps might find in my dearest Horace's compassion, &amp; that pity, he
					never denies the unhappy: would to God, I might alleviate in some measure his Sorrows, in the part I willingly would bear in them,
					&amp; in that commiseration, which I should feel for any one in such circumstances, how much more then for him whose friendship has
					been my greatest joy, &amp; I hope shall continue so many years: for God's sake, as soon as melancholy reflection shall give you any
					intermission, let me hear of your welfare; let me have the pleasure of a line, or the sight of you, as soon as it can be proper:
					believe, I shall not enjoy a moments ease, till I have some information of your condition;</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>I am, my dearest Walpole, <lb/> with the greatest truth, <lb/> your faithful friend, &amp; servant,</salute>
