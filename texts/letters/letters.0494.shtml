      </div>
      <p>The dear testimonial of your friendship reachd Bristol about the time when the last
         offices were done to my lost angel at the Cathedral &amp; was brought to me hither just
         now; Where I had fled to My Wadworth<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> relations a few Hours before the Ceremony. I cannot express the State of my Mind
         or health, I know not what either of them are. But I think that I mean at present
         to steal thro London very soon &amp; come to you at Cambridge, tho I fear it is about
         the time you are going to Town. I have business there with Sidney College.</p>
      <div class="closer">
         <div class="salute">I can add no more. But that I am as much Yours as I am my own</div>
