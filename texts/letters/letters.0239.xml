         <p> I ought before now to have thanked you for your kind offer, wch I mean soon to accept for a reason, wch to be sure can be no reason
					to you or Mrs Wharton, &amp; therefore I think it my duty to give you notice of it. it is a very possible thing I may be ill again in
					Town, wch I would not chuse to be in a dirty inconvenient lodgeing, where perhaps my nurse might stifle me with a pillow, and therefore
					it is no wonder, if I prefer your house. but I tell you of this in time, that if either of you are frighted at the thought of a sick
					body, you may make a handsome excuse, &amp; save yourselves this trouble. you are not to imagine my illness is in <hi rend="italic">Esse;</hi> no, it is only in <hi rend="italic">Posse,</hi> otherwise I should myself be scrupulous of bringing it home to you. I
					shall be in town in about a fortnight. you will be sorry (as I am) at the destruction of poor [
						] views, wch promised so fair: but both he &amp; I have known it this long time, so, I believe, he
					was prepared, &amp; his old Patron is no bad ressource. I am told, it is the fashion to be totally
					silent with regard to the ministry. nothing is to be talked of, or even suspected, till the
					Parliament meets. in the mean time the new <hi rend="italic">Manager</hi> has taken what appears to
					me a very odd step. if you do not hear of a thing, wch is in it's nature no secret, I can not well
					inform you by the Post. to me it is utterly unaccountable.</p>
         <p>Pray what is the reason I do not read your name among the Censors of the College? did they not
					offer it you, or have you refused it? I have not done a word more of <hi rend="italic">Bard,</hi> having been in a very listless,
					unpleasant, &amp; inutile state of Mind for this long while, for wch I shall beg you to prescribe me somewhat strengthning &amp;
					agglutinant, lest it turn to a confirm'd Pthisis. to shew you how epidemical Self-Murther is this
						year, Lady M. Capel (Ld Essex's Sister) a young Person, has just
					cut the veins of both arms across, but (they say) will not die of it. she was well &amp; in her senses, tho' of a family that are apt
					to be otherwise.
