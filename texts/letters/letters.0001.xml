				     <p>I believe by your not making me happy in a longer letter than that I have just received, you had a design to prevent my tireing you
					with a tedious one; but in revenge for your neglect I'm resolved to send you one five times as long: Sr, do you think, that I'll be
					fob'd off with eleven lines and a half? after waiting this week in continual expectation, &amp;
					proposing to myself all the pleasure, that you, if you would, might give me; Gadsbud! I am provoked into a fermentation! when I see you
					next, I'll firk you, I'll rattle you with a Certiorari: let me tell you; I am at present as full of
					wrath &amp; choler, as–as–you are of wit &amp; good-nature; though I begin to doubt your title to the last of them, since
					you have balked me in this manner: what an excuse do you make with your Passion-week &amp; fiddle-faddle, as if you could ever be at a
					loss what to say; why, I, that am in the country could give you a full &amp; true account of half a
					dozen Intrigues, nay I have an amour carried on almost under my window between a boar &amp; a sow, people of very good fashion, that
					come to an assignation, and squeak like ten masquerades; I have a great mind to make you hear the whole progress of the affair,
					together with the humours of Miss Pigsnies, the lady's Confidente; but you will think perhaps I invent it, &amp; so I shall let it
					alone: but I wonder you are not ashamed of yourself; in town, and not able to furnish out an epistle as long as a Cows tail! (excuse
					the rusticity of my simile) in short, I have tryed and condemned you in my mind, all that you can alledge to save yourself won't do;
					for I find by your excuses you are brought to your derniere Chemise; and as you stand guilty, I adjudge
					you to be drawn to the place of execution, your chamber; where taking pen in hand, you shall write a letter as long as this, to him,
					who is nothing, when not</p>
