      </div>
      <p>Your letter has rejoiced me (as you will easily believe) &amp; agreeably disappointed
         me. I congratulate you in the first place; &amp; am very glad to see, the College have
         had the spirit &amp; the sense to do a thing so much to their credit, &amp; to do it in a
         handsome manner. my best service to Mr Lyon, &amp; tell him it will be a great disobligation,
         if my Lady takes him away to pass the Christmas with her, just when I am proposing
         to visit him in his new capacity. I hope to be with you in about a week, but will
         write again before I come: do persuade Mr Delaval to stay: tell him, I will say any
         thing he pleases of Mr P:
      </p>
      <p>Have you read the Negotiations? (I speak not to Mr Del:, but to you) the French have
         certainly done Mr P: service in publishing them. the spirit &amp; contempt he has shewn
         in his treatment of Bussy's proposals, whether right or wrong, will go near to restore
         him to his popularity, &amp; almost make up for the disgrace of the pension. my Ld T:
         is outrageous: he makes no scruple of declaring, that the D: of N: &amp; Ld B: were the
         persons, whose frequent opposition in Council were the principal cause of this resignation.
         he has (as far as he could) disinherited his Brother G: Gr:lle that is, of about 4000Â£
         a-year, his Father's estate. &amp; yesterday he made a very strange speech in the House,
         that surprised every body. the particulars I can not yet hear with certainty. but
         the D: of Bedford replied to it. did you observe a <span style="font-style:italic">very bold</span> letter in the Gazetteer of Thursday last about <span style="font-style:italic">Carr, Earl of Somerset</span>? how do you like the K:s Speech? it is Ld Hardwick's. how do you like Hogarth's Perriwigs?
         I suppose, you have discover'd the last face in the rank of Peeresses to be a very
         great personage, extremely like; tho' you never saw her. Good night!
