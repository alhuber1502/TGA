         <q>
            <p>
						Commanding beauty, smoothed by cheerful grace,<lb/> 
						Sat on each opening feature of his face: <lb/>
						Bold was his language, rapid, glowing, strong; <lb/>
						And science flowed spontaneous from his tongue. <lb/>
						With genius, seizing systems, slighting rules, <lb/>
						And, void of gall, with boundless scorn of fools. <lb/>
						Ambition dealt her flambeau to his hand, <lb/>
						And Bacchus aided to illume the brand. <lb/>
						His wish, to counsel monarchs or control; <lb/>
						His means?â&#x80;&#x94;th' impetuous ardour of his soul; <lb/>
						For Prudence, daring not to eye his aim, <lb/>
						Lent not a pop-gun to bring down the game. <lb/>
						Swift too the scaffold of his airy pride <lb/>
						Fellâ&#x80;&#x94;but slight-built, diffused no ruin wide. <lb/>
						Unhurt, undaunted, undisturbed, he fell; <lb/>
						Could laugh the same, and the same stories tell: <lb/>
						And more a sage than he, who bade await <lb/>
						His revels, till his conquests were complete, <lb/>
						Our jovial statesman either sail unfurled, <lb/>
						And drank his bottle, though he missed the world.
