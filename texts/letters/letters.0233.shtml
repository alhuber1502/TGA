      <p>When you name a Fever &amp; Rash in the middle of August, I can not but enquire (as soon
         as I am able) what you are doing to get rid of them, &amp; how you are, since I heard
         from you. I do not at all expect an answer from yourself; but should be much obliged
         to you, if you would order Harry or Louis to write me a line of information. I myself
         am a little better &amp; a little worse for my <span style="font-style:italic">advice.</span> the heats I felt in a morning are abated, if not gone; and in their room I have got
         the head-ach, wch with me is a very unusual thing. Adieu! I hope to hear a better
         account of you.
