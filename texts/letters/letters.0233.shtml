      <p>When you name a Fever &amp; Rash in the middle of August,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I can not but enquire (as soon as I am able<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>) what you are doing to get rid of them, &amp; how you are, since I heard from you. I
         do not at all expect an answer from yourself; but should be much obliged to you, if
         you would order Harry<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or Louis<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to write me a line of information. I myself am a little better &amp; a little worse for
         my <span style="font-style:italic">advice.</span> the heats I felt in a morning are abated, if not gone; and in their room I have got
         the head-ach, wch with me is a very unusual thing. Adieu! I hope to hear a better
         account of you.</p>
