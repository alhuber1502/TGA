				     <p>I ought to answer you in Latin, but I feel I dare not enter the lists with you – cupidum,
					pater optime, vires deficiunt. Seriously you write in that language with a grace and an Augustan
					urbanity that amazes me: Your Greek too is perfect in its kind. And here let me wonder that a man, longè græcorum doctissimus, should
					be at a loss for the verse and chapter whence my epigram is taken. I am sorry I have not my Aldus with me that I might satisfy your
					curiosity; but he with all my other literary folks are left at Oxford, and therefore you must still rest in suspense. I thank you again
					and again for your medical prescription. I know very well that those 'risus, festivitates, &amp; facetiæ' would contribute greatly to
					my cure, but then you must be my apothecary as well as physician, and make up the dose as well as direct it; send me, therefore, an
					electuary of these drugs, made up secundùm artem, 'et eris mihi magnus Apollo', in both his capacities
					as a god of poets and god of physicians. Wish me joy of leaving my college, and leave yours as fast as you can. I shall be settled at
					the Temple very soon.</p>
