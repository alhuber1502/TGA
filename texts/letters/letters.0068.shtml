         <div class="salute">Dear Ashton,</div>
      </div>
      <p>You and West have made us happy to night in a heap of letters, &amp; we are resolvd to
         repay you tenfold. Our English perhaps may not be the best in the World, but we have
         the Comfort to know that it is at least as good as our French. So to begin. Paris
         is a huge round City, divided by the Seine, a very near relation (if we may judge
         from the resemblance) of your old acquaintance, that ancient river, the river Cam.
         Along it on either side runs a key of perhaps as handsome buildings, as any in the
         World. the view down which on either hand from the Pont Neuf is the charming'st Sight
         imaginable. There are infinite Swarms of inhabitants &amp; more Coaches than Men. The
         Women in general dressd in Sacs, flat Hoops of 5 yards wide nosegays of artificial
         flowers, on one shoulder, and faces dyed in Scarlet up to the Eyes. The Men in bags,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> roll-upps,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Muffs and Solitaires.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> our Mornings have been mostly taken up in Seeing Sights: few Hotels or Churches have
         escapd us, where there is anything remarkable as to building, Pictures or Statues.</p>
      <p>Mr Conway is as usual, the Companion of our travels, who, till we came, had not seen
         anything at all; for it is not the fashion here to have Curiosity. We had at first
         arrival an inundation of Visits pouring in upon us, for all the English are acquainted,
         and herd much together &amp; it is no easy Matter to disengage oneself from them, so that
         one sees but little of the French themselves. </p>
      <p>To be introduced to the People of high quality, it is absolutely necessary to be master
         of the Language, for it is not to be imagind that they will take pains to understand
         anybody, or to correct a stranger's blunders. Another thing is, there is not a House
         where they don't play, nor is any one at all acceptable, unless they do so too ..
         a professed Gamester being the most advantageous Character a Man can have at Paris.
         The AbbÃ©s indeed &amp; Men of learning are a People of easy access enough, but few English
         that travel have knowledge enough to take any great Pleasure in their Company, at
         least our present Set of travellers have not. We are, I think to remain here no longer
         than Ld Conway stays, and then set out for Rheims, there to reside a Month or two,
         &amp; then to return hither again. this is our present design &amp; very often little hankerings
         break out, so that I am not sure, we shall not come back tomorrow.</p>
      <p>We are exceedingly unsettled &amp; irresolute, don't know our own Minds for two Moments
         together, profess an utter aversion for all Manner of fatigue, grumble, are ill natured
         &amp; try to bring ourselves to a State of perfect Apathy in which [we] are so far advanced,
         as to declare we have no Notion of caring for any mortal breathing but ourselves.
         In short I think the greatest <span style="font-style:italic">evil</span> [that] could have happen'd to us, is our liberty, for we are not at all capable to
         determine our own actions.</p>
