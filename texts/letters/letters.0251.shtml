         <div class="salute">Dear Mason</div>
      </div>
      <p>I received your Letters both at once<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> yesterday which was Thursday, such is the irregularity of our Post. the affair of
         Southwell<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at this time is exceedingly unlucky. if it is committed to you, by all means defer
         it. it is even worth while to stop Mrs Southwell,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who will enter into the reason of it. another thing is, you have very honestly &amp;
         generously renounced your own interest (I mention it not as a compliment, but <span style="font-style:italic">pour la rareté du fait</span>) to serve Mr B:; but what if you might serve him still better by seemingly making
         interest for yourself.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Addison<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> must certainly be a Competitor. he will have the old (new) Ld Walpole of Wolterton,
         his Patron, to back him, the Bp of Chester, the Heads, who know him for a staunch
         Man, &amp; consequently the D: of N:. if you can divide or carry this interest, &amp; by it
         gain the dirty part of the College, so as to throw it into Mr B:s scale at pleasure,
         perhaps it may produce an unanimous election. this struck me last night as a practicable
         thing. but I see some danger in it. for you may disoblige your own friends, &amp; Ld H:
         must, I doubt, be acquainted with your true design, who very likely will not come
         into it. T:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> also &amp; Mr B: himself should be acquainted with it immediately. consider therefore
         well, whether this or the plain open way (wch, I own, is commonly the best) be most
         likely to succeed. the former, if it be found impracticable for Mr B: at last, may
         make it sure for yourself, wch is to be wish'd in the next place. it is odd to talk
         thus to a Man about himself, but I think, I know to whom I am talking. I have puzzled
         my head about a list of the College, &amp; can make out only these. pray, supply it for
         me.</p>
      <ul>

         <li class="item">Mapletoft<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></li>
         <li class="item">– Axton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I don't know, if Spencer's Fell:p be vacant or not. nor whether a majority only of
         the whole, or two thirds, be required to chuse a master.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I should hope 9 of these,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; perhaps Mapletoft too, if Gaskarth pleases, might be got for Mr B:, but I can answer
         only for T: Bedford has always profess'd a friendship for Mr B:, but he is a queer
         man. his Patron is a Mr Buller of Cornwall<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a Tory. Delaval, Gask:th, Milbourne &amp; Axton you may soon enquire into yourself. Spencer
         (if he is one) has promised Dr. Wharton.</p>
      <p>I write to Mr. W: (your Neighbour over the way)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to desire him to speak to Mr. F:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or the D: of B:d,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if it may be of use; &amp; add, that if he will let you know, he is at home, you will
         come, &amp; give him any information necessary. whether this will signify I can't say,
         but I do not see any hurt it can do.</p>
      <p>I wish, like you, I were at Camb:; but to hurry down on this occasion would be worse,
         than useless, according to my conception. I am glad you think of going,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if they approve it. Dr L:,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if he is not dead, will recover. mind, if he don't.</p>
