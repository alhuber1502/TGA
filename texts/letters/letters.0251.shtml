         <div class="salute">Dear Mason</div>
      </div>
      <p>I received your Letters both at once yesterday which was Thursday, such is the irregularity
         of our Post. the affair of Southwell at this time is exceedingly unlucky. if it is
         committed to you, by all means defer it. it is even worth while to stop Mrs Southwell,
         who will enter into the reason of it. another thing is, you have very honestly &amp; generously
         renounced your own interest (I mention it not as a compliment, but <span style="font-style:italic">pour la rareté du fait</span>) to serve Mr B:; but what if you might serve him still better by seemingly making
         interest for yourself. Addison must certainly be a Competitor. he will have the old
         (new) Ld Walpole of Wolterton, his Patron, to back him, the Bp of Chester, the Heads,
         who know him for a staunch Man, &amp; consequently the D: of N:. if you can divide or
         carry this interest, &amp; by it gain the dirty part of the College, so as to throw it
         into Mr B:s scale at pleasure, perhaps it may produce an unanimous election. this
         struck me last night as a practicable thing. but I see some danger in it. for you
         may disoblige your own friends, &amp; Ld H: must, I doubt, be acquainted with your true
         design, who very likely will not come into it. T: also &amp; Mr B: himself should be acquainted
         with it immediately. consider therefore well, whether this or the plain open way (wch,
         I own, is commonly the best) be most likely to succeed. the former, if it be found
         impracticable for Mr B: at last, may make it sure for yourself, wch is to be wish'd
         in the next place. it is odd to talk thus to a Man about himself, but I think, I know
         to whom I am talking. I have puzzled my head about a list of the College, &amp; can make
         out only these. pray, supply it for me.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li class="item">– Brown May</li>
         <li class="item">– Bedford</li>
         <li class="item">– Tuthill</li>
         <li class="item">Forester</li>
         <li class="item">– Delaval</li>
         <li class="item">– Gaskarth</li>
         <li class="item">– Cardale</li>
         <li class="item">– Milbourne</li>
         <li class="item">– Spencer</li>
         <li class="item">Mapletoft</li>
         <li class="item">– Axton</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I don't know, if Spencer's Fell:p be vacant or not. nor whether a majority only of
         the whole, or two thirds, be required to chuse a master.
      </p>
      <p>I should hope 9 of these, &amp; perhaps Mapletoft too, if Gaskarth pleases, might be got
         for Mr B:, but I can answer only for T: Bedford has always profess'd a friendship
         for Mr B:, but he is a queer man. his Patron is a Mr Buller of Cornwall a Tory. Delaval,
         Gask:th, Milbourne &amp; Axton you may soon enquire into yourself. Spencer (if he is one)
         has promised Dr. Wharton.
      </p>
      <p>I write to Mr. W: (your Neighbour over the way) to desire him to speak to Mr. F: or
         the D: of B:d, if it may be of use; &amp; add, that if he will let you know, he is at
         home, you will come, &amp; give him any information necessary. whether this will signify
         I can't say, but I do not see any hurt it can do.
      </p>
      <p>I wish, like you, I were at Camb:; but to hurry down on this occasion would be worse,
         than useless, according to my conception. I am glad you think of going, if they approve
         it. Dr L:, if he is not dead, will recover. mind, if he don't.
