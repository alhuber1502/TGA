				     <p>I write, having nothing essential to say, merely because you are ill, &amp; have but too much time
					to read me. I plead no merit in my sympathy, because I have the same enemy, &amp; am daily expecting her attacks, the more violent
					perhaps for having been now for some years suspended. talk not of round windows, nor of dying in
					them: our distemper (remember) is the means of health &amp; <hi rend="italic">long life,</hi>
					 now this latter is only the name of another distemper, of wch I know enough already to say, when the
					gout pinches me, '<hi rend="italic">tis well, it is nothing worse.</hi> I do not understand, why (with your temperance) you are treated
					so severely; but suspect, it is owing to a little indolence &amp; want of motion between the fits, as I have lately heard you complain
					of a tenderness in your feet, that would not let you walk as usual. Man is a creature made to be jumbled, &amp; no matter whether he
					goes on his head or heels, move or be moved he must. I am convinced, I owe my late &amp; present ease to the little expeditions I
					always make in summer. the smartness of the pain you undergo, is an undoubted sign of strength &amp; <hi rend="italic">youth,</hi>
					&amp; the sooner it will be over. I know, this is poor comfort: but I flatter myself, that in some few days you will be at ease, &amp;
					will have the good nature to tell me so.</p>
				     <p>I have neither seen Tyson, nor Cole of late, but will take care they shall know, what you say. the
					latter lives at Milton near the Ely road. for myself I shall hardly be in Town before the end of
					November.</p>
