         <p>IMITATION OF HORACE. Lib: I: Ep: 2: </p> 
         <p>Trojani belli scriptorem, &amp;c:</p> 
         <p>While haply You (or haply not at all) <br /> Hear the grave Pleadings in the Lawyer's Hall<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> Or, while You haply Littleton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> explore,<br /> Turning the learned leaden Pages o'er; <br /> Think me again transported to peruse <br /> The golden Rhapsodies of Milton's Muse: <br /> Who shews us in his high Seraphic Song, <br /> What just, what unjust, what is Right, what Wrong, <br /> With Sense at least, &amp; Evidence as true, <br /> As all our Judges of the Bench could do. <br /> Why thus I think (to Hardwick<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> no Offence)<br /> Give Ear, &amp; with your Coke<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> awhile dispense.</p> 
         <p>The Tale disastrous<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> You remember well,<br /> How Satan tempted, &amp; how Adam fell; <br /> And how He tasted the forbidden Tree, <br /> Seduced by female Curiosity; <br /> How thus our Paradise we lost, &amp; all <br /> The Children perish'd in the Father's Fall. <br /> Nor be that other Tale<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> forgotten here<br /> More moral, tho' less pleasing to the Ear <br /> How in the Desart Wild with Hunger spent <br /> Full forty Days our patient Saviour went. <br /> Then spurning back to Hell the wily Fiend <br /> Taught us on Heaven (Heaven only) to depend, <br /> Hence us redeem'd at our Messiah's cost: <br /> The Cross regaining, what the Apple lost. <br /> Thus, while I read our Epic Bard divine, <br /> My Mind intent with Pleasure Use to joyn, <br /> From either Poem this Instruction draws, <br /> To trust in God, &amp; to obey God's Laws.</p> 
         <p>Enough of Sermon: I perceive, you nodd. <br /> You think me mighty wise, &amp; mighty odd: <br /> Your Lips, I see, half verge upon a Smile– <br /> Dear Sir, observe the Horace in my Style. <br /> Just such to Lollius,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> his misguided Friend,<br /> He knew with decent Liberty to send <br /> Beneath the Critique dext'rous to convey <br /> Advice conceal'd, in the best-natured Way <br /> But You're no Lollius, and no Horace I: <br /> Here is no Room sage Maxims to apply. <br /> Would you not burst outright to hear me say <br /> Satan, my friend, may lead the best astray; <br /> By Nature ill, by Habit worse inclined, <br /> Add Pride, add Envy, add the willful Mind <br /> Still prone to disobey &amp; to deceive, <br /> All men are Adam, &amp; all women Eve. <br /> Thus bad, thus all corrupted, much I fear, <br /> Morality sounds painful to the Ear.</p> 
         <p>The Dogs of Night, that murder &amp; that steal, <br /> Outwatch<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Watchmen of the publick Weal:<br /> Fools, that We are! less Labour to employ <br /> To save ourselves, than Villains to destroy. <br /> Suppose your Body sick; at any Price <br /> You run to Mead<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or Hollings<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for Advice:<br /> This for thy Body: but suppose thy Mind, <br /> For that what Mead or Hollings will you find? <br /> Rise, Sluggard, rise, &amp; quit thy Morning-Bed <br /> E're yet Aurora lifts her rosy Head: <br /> Take Plato down, take Tully, take Bruyére,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> Make honest Things, &amp; Studies all thy Care: <br /> At sight of Industry Vice flies away, <br /> As Spectres vanish at the Face of Day. <br /> If ought offensive to the Eye appear <br /> Not long You let the Object be too near: <br /> What hurts the Mind more patient to endure, <br /> For Years together we delay the Cure. <br /> Meanwhile the Time irrevocable flies: <br /> Begin, &amp; have the Spirit to be wise: <br /> Begin, nor do, as did the Rustick Ass<br /> Who stood, &amp; waited till the Stream should pass: <br /> The Stream, Poor fool! You little seem to know, <br /> Flows, as it flow'd, and will for ever flow. <br /> The gay Town-house, the pleasant Country-Seat, <br /> The fertile Meadow, &amp; the Garden neat, <br /> The fruitful Nursery, the tender Wife, <br /> Are Joys Men almost value with their Life: <br /> Yet all these Joys, and more (could more be sent) <br /> Make not the Total of one Word, Content. <br /> Not all the Gold of the Peruvian Mine, <br /> Not all the Gems that blaze beneath the Line, <br /> Can cure a Fever, or one Care expell: <br /> Possessions make not the Possessour well. <br /> The Man, who lives in Hope, or lives in Fear, <br /> In nougt He has can tast the Joy sincere: <br /> Sooner shall Handel give the Deaf delight, <br /> And Rafael's Pencil charm the Blind to Sight. <br /> First cleanse the Vessel, e're the Wine you pour; <br /> T'will else be Vinegar, &amp; Wine no more. <br /> Obvious to Sense the Allegory lies: <br /> Would you be happy, be but only wise. <br /> Reject all Pleasures of the Sense: they're vain. <br /> Each Hour of Pleasure has it's Hour of Pain. <br /> Bound thy mad Wishes; fix on something sure: <br /> The Harpy Avarice is ever poor. <br /> May none but Vilain's, be with Envy curst! <br /> Of all the Vices 'tis the Vice the worst: <br /> Scarce all the Tortures of the Damn'd in Hell <br /> The Pangs of wretched Envy can excell. <br /> Sore shall He smart &amp; most severely pay, <br /> Who lets his Passion o'er his Reason sway: <br /> Oft, to his Scorn, shall his unguarded Rage <br /> Act o'er the Part of Cassius on the Stage <br /> Reprove his Friend, upbraid, insult, resent, <br /> Rave like one wild, grow sorry, &amp; repent.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> Oh, if you'd live in gentle Peace with all <br /> Restrain the boiling Fury of thy Gall: <br /> Oh! early wise it's growing force restrain; <br /> Like the Steed, curb it: like the Lyon, chain.</p> 
         <p>Youth, Youth's the Season for Instruction fit. <br /> The Colt's young Neck is pliant to the Bit. <br /> The young Hawk listens to the Master's Sound, <br /> The Whelp unlash'd was never yet a Hound. <br /> Now, Boy, 's the time. my gentle Boy, draw nigh: <br /> Come with thy blushing Front, &amp; open Eye <br /> Now, while thy Breast is, as the Current, clear, <br /> Unruffled, unpolluted, &amp; sincere: <br /> Now fair &amp; honest all thy Hours employ, <br /> For know, the Man is grafted on the Boy. <br /> The Cask once season'd keeps the Flavour long. <br /> Adieu! thus ends my moralizeing Song.</p> 
         <p>Abrupt I finish: my hard Task is o'er: <br /> Forgive me, Pope! I'll imitate no more.</p>
