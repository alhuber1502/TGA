         <div class="salute">Dear Sir, </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am much mortified that you give me so little hopes of your company on my journey,
         but I do not quite despair of that point. I am infinitely more concerned to find you
         dejected as you appear to be; I read your first letter with concern, and your last
         with greater. For God's sake how can you neglect a duty which never existed but in
         your own imagination, which catches every alarm too quickly? it never yet was performed,
         nor I believe expected. I hope your want of health is not so great as you think it.
         Is it the gout, a return of any former complaint, or what? But you need not answer
         my question, I am coming to town to be satisfied. I design to be there Wednesday sennight,
         and you will do me a favour to bespeak for me the story above you at Frisby's or some
         other lodging near you for a week. I have done my best for poor Temple. I am now half
         distracted with trying to rescue myself from the oppression of a merciless lawyer
         that is treating with me on Miss Allin's part about a lease of this house and estate;
         I have my faithful Mr. Spurgeon to counsel me, but all I believe will not do.
      </p>
