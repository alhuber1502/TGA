      </div>
      <p>I ought before now to have thanked you for your kind offer, wch I mean soon to accept
         for a reason, wch to be sure can be no reason to you or Mrs Wharton, &amp; therefore I
         think it my duty to give you notice of it. it is a very possible thing I may be ill
         again in Town, wch I would not chuse to be in a dirty inconvenient lodgeing, where
         perhaps my nurse might stifle me with a pillow, and therefore it is no wonder, if
         I prefer your house. but I tell you of this in time, that if either of you are frighted
         at the thought of a sick body, you may make a handsome excuse, &amp; save yourselves this
         trouble. you are not to imagine my illness is in <span style="font-style:italic">Esse;</span> no, it is only in <span style="font-style:italic">Posse,</span> otherwise I should myself be scrupulous of bringing it home to you. I shall be in
         town in about a fortnight.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you will be sorry (as I am) at the destruction of poor [ ]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> views, wch promised so fair: but both he &amp; I have known it this long time, so, I
         believe, he was prepared, &amp; his old Patron is no bad ressource.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I am told, it is the fashion to be totally silent with regard to the ministry.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> nothing is to be talked of, or even suspected, till the Parliament meets.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in the mean time the new <span style="font-style:italic">Manager</span> has taken what appears to me a very odd step.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if you do not hear of a thing, wch is in it's nature no secret, I can not well inform
         you by the Post. to me it is utterly unaccountable.</p>
      <p>Pray what is the reason I do not read your name among the Censors of the College?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> did they not offer it you, or have you refused it? I have not done a word more of
         <span style="font-style:italic">Bard,</span> having been in a very listless, unpleasant, &amp; inutile state of Mind for this long
         while, for wch I shall beg you to prescribe me somewhat strengthning &amp; agglutinant,
         lest it turn to a confirm'd Pthisis.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to shew you how epidemical Self-Murther is this year,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Lady M. Capel (Ld Essex's Sister)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a young Person, has just cut the veins of both arms across, but (they say) will not
         die of it. she was well &amp; in her senses, tho' of a family that are apt to be otherwise.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
