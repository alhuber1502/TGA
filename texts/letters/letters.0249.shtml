         <div class="salute">Dear Mason</div>
      </div>
      <p>I feel a contrition for my long silence; &amp; yet perhaps it is the last thing you trouble
         your head about. nevertheless I will be as sorry, as if you took it ill. I am sorry
         too to see you so punctilious, as to stand upon answers, &amp; never to come near me,
         till I have regularly left my name at your door, like a Mercer's Wife, that imitates
         People, who go a-visiting. I would forgive you this, if you could possibly suspect
         I were doing any thing, that I liked better. for then your formality might look like
         being piqued at my negligence; wch has somewhat in it like kindness: but you know
         I am at Stoke, hearing, seeing, doing, absolutely nothing. not such a nothing, as
         you do at Tunbridge, chequer'd &amp; diversified with a succession of fleeting colours;
         but heavy, lifeless, without form, &amp; void; sometimes almost as black, as the <span style="font-style:italic">Moral</span> of Voltaire's Lisbon,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch angers you so. I have had no more pores &amp; muscular inflations, &amp; am only troubled
         with this depression of mind. you will not expect therefore I should give you any
         account of my <span style="font-style:italic">Verve,</span> wch is at best (you know) of so delicate a constitution, &amp; has such weak nerves,
         as not to stir out of its chamber above three days in a year. but I shall enquire
         after yours, &amp; why it is off again? it has certainly worse nerves than mine, if your
         Reviewers have frighted it. sure I (not to mention a score of your Uncles and Aunts)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> am something a better Judge, than all the Man-Midwives &amp; Presbyterian Parsons,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that ever were born. pray give me leave to ask you. do you find yourself tickled
         with the commendations of such People? (for you have your share of these too) I dare
         say not. Your Vanity has certainly a better taste. and can then the censure of such
         Criticks move you? I own, it is an impertinence in these Gentry to talk of one at
         all either in good or in bad, but this we must all swallow, I mean not only we, that
         write, but all the <span style="font-style:italic">we's</span> that ever did any thing to be talk'd of. I canot pretend to be learned without books,
         nor to know the Druids from the Pelasgi<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at this distance from Cambridge, I can only tell you not to go &amp; take the Mona<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for the Isle of Man. it is Anglesey, a tract of plain country, very fertile, but
         picturesque only from the view it has of Caernarvonshire, from wch it is separated
         by the Menai, a narrow arm of the Sea. forgive me for supposing in you such a want
         of erudition.</p>
      <p>I congratulate you on our glorious successes in the Mediterranean. shall we go in
         time, &amp; hire a house together in Switzerland?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is a fine poetical country to look at, &amp; no body there will understand a word
         we say or write. pray, let me know what you are about, what new acquaintances you
         have made at Tunbridge, how you do in body &amp; in mind?</p>
