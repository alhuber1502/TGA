         <p>I exist, tho' it is but of late, that I walk again on two legs after a gentle fit of the gout, that held me for six weeks. in about a fortnight I shall be in town, but had rather not stay so long
					for a sight of your new edition, &amp; should wish, if you have a copy to spare, that you would send
					it me hither.</p>
         <p>Mr B:, since he was in the ministry, has taken advice of no one, but perhaps his Brother-ministers.
					Patriotism appears again with all its old faults on its head, even to the Dutchess of Marlborough's
					striped gown. don't you reckon, that there is a little flirt aim'd at you in it?</p>
         <p>I see the BP &amp; You are destined to come together: however I make my protestation beforehand,
					that I never will believe, you had an eye to the Eleusinian mysteries; or that you have demonstrated
					the truth of the Copernican system by making no mention of it in any part of your writings.</p>
