            <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I want to know a hundred things about you. are you fix'd in your house, for I hear many vague reports of Miss A:s inclination to part with the estate, &amp; that the <hi rend="italic">Loves</hi> are desirous of the
					purchase, &amp; would bid high? what part of the mansion (where I used to tremble at a breath of air) was blown down in the high wind?
					did not you bless your stars for that dreary flat, that lay between you &amp; Corton, &amp; bar'd all
					sight of the sea in its fury, &amp; of the numberless wrecks, that strew'd all your coast? as to our little &amp; unpicturesque events
					you know them, I find, &amp; have congratulated Mr Presendent, who is now our Master, in due form: but you do not know, that it never rains but it pours: he goes to Town on Monday for
					institution to the Living of Streatham in the Isle of Ely worth from two to three hundred pound
					a-year &amp; given him by the King's Majesty. the detail is infinite, the attacks, the defences, the evasions, the circumventions, the
					sacrifices, the perjuries, are only to be told by word of mouth: suffice it to say, that it is carried swimmingly &amp; triumphantly
					against two Lords temporal &amp; one spiritual, who sollicited for their several Protegés in vain: so
					our good Uncle Toby will have about 400£ a-year, no uncomfortable pittance! I have had several capricious letters from Berne. he has
					sent me some pretty views of his native country, &amp; its inhabitants. the portrait too is arrived
					done at Paris, but no more like <hi rend="italic">than I to Hercules:</hi>
					 you would think, it was intended for his Father, so grave &amp; so composed: doubtless he meant to
					look, like an Englishman or an owl. pray send me the letter, &amp; do not suppose I grudge
					postage.</p>
         <p>I rejoice you have met with Froissart: he is the Herodotus of a barbarous age. had he but had the
					luck of writing in as good a language, he might have been immortal! his locomotive disposition (for then there was no other way of
					learning things) his simple curiosity, his religious credulity, were much like those of the old Grecian. our Ancestors used to read the
					Mort d'Arthur, Amadis de Gaul, &amp; Froissart, all alike, that is,
					they no more suspected the good faith of the former than they did of the latter, but took it all for history. when you have <hi rend="italic">tant chevauché</hi>
					 as to get to the end of him, there is Monstrelet waits to take you
					up, &amp; will set you down at <hi rend="italic">Philip de Comines.</hi>
					 but previous to all these you should have read <hi rend="italic">Villehardouin,</hi>
					 &amp; <hi rend="italic">Joinville.</hi>
					 I do not think myself bound to defend the character of even the best of Kings. pray slash them,
					&amp; spare not. my best compliments to Mrs Nicholls.</p>

            <salute>I am very sincerely,<lb/> Yours </salute>

            <p>Your friend Mr Crofts has just left me. he is a candidate for the University &amp; will succeed in
						the room of De Grey, now Chief-Justice of ye Common-Pleas.</p>
