				     <p>I did not allow myself time to rejoyce with Ashton upon his good fortune, till after I had ransacked
					all his informations, as to you; &amp; with him admired your judgement &amp; conduct; for these
					virtues (I find, you are resolved to shew us) you are as well acquainted with, as we knew you were with their Sisters: what! will no
					less than the whole family serve your turn; sure one of 'em might have contented any moderate stomach! there's Miss Temperance, Miss
					Constance &amp; the rest of 'em; e'er a one, i'gad, a match for an emperour: these, it is well known, or the world much belies you, you
					have Had; deny it, if you can; and must poor Miss Prue go to pot too? well, I say no more, but it's too much in all conscience,
					methinks, for one man to be fit equally for this world, &amp; the next. they tell me you are to be here once more in a little while;

					make after cutting for the simples? have you read yourself to sleep with Dr Swift's
						conversation, as I did? that confounded Lady Answerall, tho' she says less than any body, is the
					devil to me! pray did you ever see an elephant? I have. if you han't, you never saw an ugly thing. I would not be Aurengzebe for the
					world; they say, he rid upon one: that's </p>
