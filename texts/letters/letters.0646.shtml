      </div>
      <p>        From the Time I saw your Letter, I had little Reason to entertain any Hopes
         of poor M<span class="super">r</span> Whithed's Life, yet have not been at all less struck with the News of his Death.
         His youth, his fortune, &amp; his Expectations, must make it a Subject of Compassion,
         even to Strangers: his Temper, his many good Qualities, &amp; that Kindness I have constantly
         received from him, will make his Loss particularly sensible to me, who have (God knows)
         so few Friends to throw away, but I own, what most nearly interests me in it, is the
         Concern of M<span class="super">r</span> Chute, whose Surprize must have been equal to his Sorrow, &amp; who perhaps had not Time
         or Resolution to see a Face he had been so long accustom'd to, till it was hid from
         him for ever. I can not think of troubling him with so useless a Thing as a Letter
         at such a Time, but must beg of you, if you either see, or have occasion to write
         to him, just to say, how much I feel for him &amp; how eagerly I wish him that Happiness,
         &amp; Ease of Mind, w<span class="super">ch</span> Time only can give him: for his own Reflexion &amp; Good Sense will, I am afraid, but
         add to his Sensibility. You will much oblige me, when you can give me any Account
         of him, or of any Thing that concerns him, for you see I have no body else to apply
         to; &amp; tho' the Loss you have had in your own Family (w<span class="super">ch</span> I am heartily sorry for) makes this an unreasonable Request, yet (I trust) you will
         find a quarter of an hour to satisfy my Inquietude.
