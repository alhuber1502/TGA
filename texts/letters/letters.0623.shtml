         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>Your Friend <span style="font-style:italic">Jean Froissart,</span> Son of Thomas by profession a Herald-painter, was born at Valenciennes in Haynault
         about the year 1337. was by nature fond of every <span style="font-style:italic">noble</span> diversion, as hunting, hawking, dress, good-cheer, wine, &amp; women (this latter passion
         commenced at 12 years old) and was in his own time no less distinguish'd by his gallant
         poesies (still preserved in Mss) than by his historical writings, wch he begun at
         the desire of <span style="font-style:italic">Robert de Namur,</span> Seigneur de Beaufort, when he was barely 20 years of age. at 24 he made his first
         voyage into England, &amp; presented the first part of his history to Edw: the 3d's Queen,
         Philippa of Haynault, who appointed him <span style="font-style:italic">Clerk of her chamber,</span> that is, Secretary, by wch he became one of the Houshold in that Court. after the
         death of this Queen in 1369 he had the Living of <span style="font-style:italic">Lessines</span> in his own country given him, &amp; must then consequently be a Priest. he attach'd himself
         to Wenceslaus of Luxemburg, Duke of Brabant, who dying in 1384, he became Clerk of
         the Chappel to Guy Comte de Blois, who probably gave him a canonry in the collegiate
         Church of <span style="font-style:italic">Chimay</span> near Marienbourg in the county of Haynault.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he also had obtain'd of the Pope a reversion of another canonry in the Church of
         Lisle; but of this he never could get possession. after 27 years absence from England
         he made a third voyage thither in 1395, &amp; stay'd in it only 3 months. his Patron Guy
         de Blois died in 1397, &amp; Froissart survived him certainly 4 years, but how much more
         is uncertain. these &amp; many more particulars are taken from the account of his life
         &amp; writings collected by Mons: <span style="font-style:italic">de la Curne</span> de St Palaye,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in 10 Tome of the <span style="font-style:italic">Mem: de l'Acad: des Inscript:ns</span> &amp;c: where you may see much more about him. the same Author defends him strongly against
         the suspicions, that have been entertain'd, of his partiality to the English Nation.</p>
      <p>A Man at arms was a complicated machine, consisting of about seven Men, i:e: the Knight
         or Gentleman himself compleatly &amp; heavily arm'd &amp; mounted on his great war-horse caparison'd
         &amp; arm'd as strongly as the Rider: the rest were his Esquires rather meant to assist
         him &amp; watch his motions in the combat, than to engage in action themselves. all of
         them were (as I apprehend) on horseback, &amp; thus taken together, made the principal
         strength &amp; principal expence of armies in those days. <span style="font-style:italic">Ecuyers</span> were the sons of Gentleman,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> train'd up in quality of <span style="font-style:italic">Pages</span> till 12 years old (commonly not in their Father's Castle, but in that of some famous
         Knight, his Friend) after wch age they assumed the title of <span style="font-style:italic">Esquires,</span> were exercised daily in feats of arms &amp; curtesy, attended the person of their Lord
         at home &amp; abroad, and at 21 were qualified to receive themselves the order of knighthood.
         read the same St Palaye's <span style="font-style:italic">Mem: de l'ancienne Chevalerie,</span> 2 v: 8vo. 1759, Paris. if you would have me say any thing to T:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you must remind me, what period of time he enquired about, for my memory fails me.</p>
      <p>You may be sure of a month's notice from me, if I undertake the voyage,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch seems to me next to impossible. I received a letter from B:n last night, wch
         mentions you kindly, &amp; seems very desirous, we should come this summer. what you m[entio]n<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of herrings<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I know not: I have never seen or heard of them!</p>
      <p>Monstrelet<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> reaches from A:D: 1400 to 1467,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; there are additions at the end of him, that come down to 1516. it is a splendid
         &amp; very substantial Folio, publ:d in 1572.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
