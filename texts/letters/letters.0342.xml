					       <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I was alarmed to hear the condition you were in, when you left Cambridge, &amp; tho' Mr Brown had a letter to tell him, you were
					mending apace, while I was there; yet it would give me great pleasure to hear more particularly from yourself, how you are. I am just
					settled in my new habitation in Southampton-Row, &amp;, tho' a solitary &amp; dispirited creature,
					not unquiet, nor wholly unpleasant to myself. the Musæum will be my chief amusement. I this day passed thro' the jaws of a great Leviathan, that lay in my way, into the belly of Dr
						Templeman, Super-Intendent of ye reading-room, who congratulated himself on the sight of so much
					good company. We were A Man, that writes for Ld Royston; A Man, that writes for Dr Burton of York; a third, that writes for the Emperour of Germany, or Dr
						Pocock, for he speaks the worst English I ever heard; Dr. Stukely,
					who writes for himself, the very worst Person he could write for; &amp; I, who only read to know, if there were any thing worth
					writing, &amp; that not without some difficulty. I find, that they printed 1000 copies of ye Harleian Catalogue, and have sold fourscore; that they have 900£ a year income, &amp; spend 1300, &amp; that they are building
					apartments for the Under-Keepers, so I expect in Winter to see the Collection advertised, &amp; set to auction.</p>
				     <p>Have you read the Clarendon-book? do you remember Mr Cambridge's
					account of it, before it came out; how well he recollected all the faults, &amp; how utterly he forgot all the beauties? surely the
					grossest Taste is better, than such a sort of Delicacy.</p>
				     <p>The Invasion goes on as quietly, as if we believed every Frenchman, that set his foot on English
					ground, would die on the spot, like a Toad in Ireland: no body, but I &amp; Fobus, are in a fright
					about it. by the way he goes to Church (not for the invasion) but eversince his Sister Castle-comer
					died, who was the last of ye brood.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Moralize upon the death of my Lady Essex, &amp; do write to me soon, for I am ever
						yours</salute>
				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p>At Mr. Jauncey's, Southampton-Row, Bloomsbury. </p>
					       <p>I have not a Frank in ye World, nor have I time to send to Mr Frazier.
