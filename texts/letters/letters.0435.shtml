      <p>I am ashamed of my own indolence in not answering your former letter:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a second,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch I have since received, adds to my shame, &amp; quickens my motions. I can see no
         manner of objection to your design of publishing C: A:s<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> works compleat in your own country. it will be an evidence of your regard for him,
         that can not but be very acceptable to him. the Glasgow-Press,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or that of Baskervile,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> have given specimens of their art equal (at least) in beauty to any thing, that Europe
         can produce. the expence you will not much regard on such an occasion, &amp; (if you suffer
         them to be sold) that would be great diminish'd, and most probably reimbursed. as
         to notes (and I think, some will be necessary) I easily believe you will not overload
         the text with them, &amp; besides every thing of that kind will be concerted between you.
         if you propose any Vignettes or other matters of ornament, it would be well they were
         design'd in Italy, &amp; the gravings executed either there, or in France, for in this
         country they are woeful &amp; beyond measure dear. the revising of the Press must be your
         own labour, as tedious as it is inglorious: but to this you must submit. as we improve
         in our types, &amp;c: we grow daily more negligent in point of correctness, &amp; this even
         in our own tongue. what will it be in the Italian?</p>
      <p>I did not mean, you should have told C: A: my objection,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at least not as from me, who have no pretence to take such a liberty with him: but
         I am glad, he has alter'd the passage. he can not wonder, if I wish'd to save to our
         nation the only honour it has in matters of Taste, &amp; no small one, since neither Italy
         nor France have ever had the least notion of it, nor yet do at all comprehend it,
         when they see it. Mr Mason has received the books in question from an unknown hand,
         wch I take to be Mr Holles,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> from whom I too have received a beautiful set of Engravings, as a present; I know
         not why, unless as a Friend of yours. I saw &amp; read the beginning of this year the
         <span style="font-style:italic">Congresso di Citéra,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; was excessively pleased in spite of prejudice, for I am naturally no friend to
         allegory, nor to poetical prose. <span style="font-style:italic">entre nous</span> what gives me the least pleasure of any of his writings, that I have seen, is the
         <span style="font-style:italic">Newtonianism.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is so direct an imitation of Fontenelle,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a Writer not easy to imitate, &amp; least of all in the Italian tongue, whose character
         &amp; graces are of a higher style &amp; never adapt themselves easily to the elegant <span style="font-style:italic">badinage</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">legereté</span> of conversation, that sets so well on the French: but this is a secret between us.</p>
      <p>I am glad to hear, he thinks of revisiting England tho' I am a little ashamed of my
         country at this present. our late-acquired glory does not set becomingly upon us;
         &amp; even the Author of it, that <span style="font-style:italic">Restitutor d'Inghilterra,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is doing God knows what! if he should deign to follow the track of vulgar Ministers,
         &amp; regain his power by ways injurious to his fame, whom can we trust hereafter?</p>
      <p>M: de Nivernois<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on his return to France, says (I hear) of England, Quel Roy, quel Peuple, quelle
         Societé! &amp; so say I.</p>
