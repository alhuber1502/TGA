				     <p>You had received an answer to your last letter sooner, had I been able to write: but I have been very ill for near a month, &amp; this is the first day, that I have breath'd the open air. I do not believe, I can give you any
					satisfaction as to the Proven√ßal poetry. Italy &amp; France abound in such Manuscripts, but we (I believe) have little of the kind
					among us left: at least I remember no such article in our Libraries. as to Eglisham's Pamphlet I have
					formerly read it here, &amp; think, I know, where it is: Baker's Extract is only a part of it
					relating to K: James's death, but there is more of it (as I remember) about the Marq:ss Hamilton worth transcribing. if the facts are
					true, it is curious; &amp; you shall have it soon.</p>
				     <p>I received your books &amp; former letter unrifled, &amp; thank you much for them. the
						Anti-Twitcherites are numerous &amp; sanguine, &amp; make themselves sure of throwing him out,
					whatever becomes of their own Candidate: but as they are nearly equal, I doubt his Lp has some trick left to turn the scale.</p>
				     <p>You are very perverse &amp; mysterious about your discoveries: but I hope to be satisfied next month. you never said a word about Mr
						B:y's
					<hi rend="italic">Patriotism</hi>: I hope no body found out, how good some of it is. has he made his market by it?
