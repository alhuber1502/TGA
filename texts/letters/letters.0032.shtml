      <p>As I shall stay only a fortnight longer in Town, I'll beg you to give yourself the
         trouble of writing out my Bills, &amp; sending 'em, that I may put myself out of your
         Debt, as soon as I come down: if Piazza should come to You, you'll be so good as to
         satisfie him; I protest, I forget what I owe him, but he is honest enough to tell
         you right: my Father &amp; Mother desire me to send their compliments, &amp; I beg you'd believe
         me
