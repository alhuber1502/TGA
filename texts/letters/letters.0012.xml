         <p>Don't believe, that I would refuse to do anything for your sake, since at this present I am starving for you, &amp; losing my dinner,
					that I may have the better opportunity of writing: you could not have given me a fairer occasion for shewing my obedience to your
					commands, than you have done in bidding me stay, where I am; for tho' before I was quite set upon coming to town, you give me so many
					reasons against it, that I am perfectly easy, &amp; shall expect your coming with great resignation, that is, if you don't make it too
					long first: I read yesterday in the news, that Sr R: W:s youngest Son, a young Gentleman of great hopes, was coming to
					Trinity-Colledge, Cambridge; pray, let me know, whither you are acquainted with him, &amp; what hopes we may entertain of him; there
					are few here, but what give a good character of him, especially a long ungainly Mortal of Kings Col:
					&amp; a little, waddling Fresh-man of Pet: House, who pretend to be intimate with him: I can't see,
					how it should be; but however every body begins to envy the[m already; they are p]eople of very bad
					Repute; one of 'em is neither a Whig, nor a Tory, &amp; the other passes for a Conjurer:– there is nothing to be seen in the
					Streets, at present, but new-made Batchelors, who walk to &amp; fro, to shew their new Gowns; their examination is now over, during
					which time, they are obliged to set in the theatre for three days, from 8 in the morning till 5 at night without any fire; the first
					two days, they are liable to all the impertinent Questions wch any Master of arts is pleased to ask them; they must answer every thing
					in Philosophy, which is proposed to them, &amp; all this in Latin: the 3d day the first Moderator
					takes 'em out, half a dozen at a time into a Gallery atop of the theatre, in sight of every body, but out of hearing; he examines them
					again, as long as he will, &amp; in what Sciences he pleases: the Junior-Moderator does the same thing in the afternoon; &amp; then
					both the Proctors, if they have a mind; but they seldom do: the next day the Vice-chancellour &amp; two Proctors tell them, whither
					they shall have their degrees, or not; &amp; put on their Batchelours Gown &amp; Cap: then they go all into the Schools, &amp; one
					fellow belonging to each of the Colledges, gets into the Rostrum, &amp; asks each of his Batchelours some strange Question: this was
					one, whch was asked t'other day–Mi Filî, Domine, Domine N: quid est Matrimonium? The Answer was, Est conjunctio nunc copulativa,
					nunc disjunctiva. so then every body must laugh &amp; the ceremony is ended. I tell you this, because it will be mine own Case some
					time or other, so I hope you will excuse me for tiring you with the account. and now, my dearest Hamlet, heaven send me safe from
					Wittemberg, or thee [...]
