					       <salute> Dear Sir, </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p> I will beg the favour of your Milton once more. I have considerd your Observations in the Paper you oblig'd me with yesterday. I think them excellent and shall correct accordingly.</p>
				     <p> The only one of the least consequence that sticks with me is your hint about the Introduction. And I owe it to your frankness, to
					tell you my sincere sentiments. I hate the hypocrisy of those men who think to cover their own dullness under the mask of piety, as
					much as you can do. I know too what is to be said for those who have not devoted themselves to a Profession And still further for those
					who read the Poets, not for amusement only, but to contend with the best of them. I honour, in a word, true poetry and true Poets as
					much as any body. And I think, in particular, with you that M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Pope's apologies for himself were very needless.
					Yet still in my own case I must profess to you with sincerity, that what I say in the Letter is my real opinion. The Profession, I am of, is a sacred one. And tho' it does not oblige me to renounce the poets, my business,
					I think, should lie elsewhere. I assure you, I take this design to be but a decent one in my circumstances, and, considering the
					circumstances of the time, an absolute Duty. So that when these things are out of my hands, and the few Dialogues I mention'd to you, I
					have determin'd long since to pass the remainder of my Life (I mean if in that remainder I do any thing as a writer) in the concerns of
					my own Profession. However there are some things in the Introduction put more strongly than they needed to have been, and these I shall
					soften; principally because what I leave will then be understood, not as words of course, but as my real meaning.</p>
				     <p> You will think I treat you very formally, in entering into this serious explanation. I do it to show you on what grounds, and with
					what reluctance, I deny myself the use of any part of your kind Intimations to me.</p>
