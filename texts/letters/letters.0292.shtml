      <p>This abrupt execution plunges the reader into that sudden fearful perplexity which
         is designed to predominate through the whole. the irresistible violence of the prophet's
         passions bears him away, who, as he is unprepared by a formal ushering in of the speaker,
         is unfortified against the impressions of his poetical phrenzy and overpowered by
         them, as sudden thunders strike the deepest.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>[ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  ]</p>
      <p>Here a vision of triumphant revenge is judiciously made to ensue, after the pathetic
         lamentation which precedes it. Breaks â&#x80;&#x93; double rhymes â&#x80;&#x93; an appropriated cadence
         â&#x80;&#x93; and an exalted ferocity of language forcibly picture to us the uncontroulable
         tumultuous workings of the prophet's stimulated bosom.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>

      <p>Can there be an image more just, apposite, and nobly imagined than this tremendous
         tragical winding-sheet? In the rest of this stanza the wilderness of thought, expression,
         and cadence are admirably adapted to the character and situation of the speaker, and
         of the bloody spectres his assistants. It is not indeed peculiar to it alone, but
         a beauty that runs throughout the whole composition, that the historical events are
         briefly sketched out by a few striking circumstances, in which the Poet's office of
         rather exciting and directing, than satisfying the reader's imagination, is perfectly
         observed. Such abrupt hints, resembling the several fragments of a vast ruin, suffer
         not the mind to be raised to the utmost pitch, by one image of horror, but that instantaneously
         a second and a third are presented to it, and the affection is still uniformly supported.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
