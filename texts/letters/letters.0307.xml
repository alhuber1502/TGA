            <dateline>Jan: 31. 1758.</dateline>
            <salute> Dear S<hi rend="super">r</hi>
            </salute>
         </opener>
         <p> Having been for a little while in Huntingdonshire, on my return to this place I find a letter from
					you, the end of w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> gives me much concern. I am very sorry we are at such a distance from one another, that it
					must be yet some time, before I can have any account of your health. if you are, as I flatter myself, recover'd, you will (I hope) do
					me the pleasure of letting me hear it without delay. if so much of your indisposition remain as to make writing at all troublesome to
					you, may I presume so far on the good-nature of Miss Swinburne, as to beg She would give me three
					lines of information. this young Lady has done me so great an honour already, as gives me courage to apply myself to her on this
					occasion. I preserve (&amp; always shall preserve with great care) the beautiful little Specimen of her art, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi>
					came inclosed in your letter. I am only sorry, that when I would shew &amp; make my boast of it to eyes, that are worthy of that
					satisfaction, I shall be obliged to cover a part of it, &amp; consequently to rob her of a part of her due praises. this is your fault
					(for I hope you did not explain the Latin inscription to her). however I return my thanks to you both,
					to Miss Sw: for all above board, &amp; to You, for what only I am to see.</p>
         <p> I go on (with the hope, that you are well enough to read me) to tell you, that I have lately received nine pages of anonymous
					criticism, containing a good deal both of praise &amp; censure on the <hi>Bard</hi> only. if I thought fit to hear his opinion about
					the other, I was to direct to A: B: at a place, w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> he told me. I have had the
					gratitude, or curiosity, or what you please to call it, to follow his direction, &amp; now I have got six pages more, &amp; his name
					(for that I insisted upon) yet am not much the wiser: however he is a Man of Letters &amp; a good sensible Person, &amp; depends upon
					no body, &amp; has a little garden. this is all, that I know about him.</p>
         <p> I will not send you the <hi>Sonnet</hi> you mention, but here is something else full as bad, only
					as it is just wrote, I send it you. it is an epitaph on the Wife of a Friend of mine.</p>
         <q> Lo, where this little Marble weeps,<lb/> A Friend, a Wife, a Mother sleeps,<lb/> A Heart, within
					whose sacred cell<lb/> Each peaceful Virtue lov'd to dwell,<lb/> Affection warm, &amp; Faith
					sincere,<lb/> And soft Humanity, were there.<lb/> To hide her Cares her only art,<lb/> Her pleasure pleasures to impart.<lb/> In
					ling'ring pain, in death resign'd,<lb/> Her latest agony of mind<lb/> Was felt for him, who could not save<lb/> His All from an
					untimely grave:<lb/> Whom what awaits, while yet he strays<lb/> Along the lonely vale of days?<lb/>
					A pang to silent Sorrow dear,<lb/> A sigh, an unavailing tear,<lb/> Till Time shall ev'ry grief
					remove<lb/> With life, with mem'ry, &amp; with love.<lb/>
         </q>
         <closer>
            <salute> Adieu, dear S<hi rend="super">r</hi>. be well, or you will think this letter very impertinent I am<lb/> Your Friend &amp;
						Servant </salute>

            <p> P:S: You should not shew this, because it is not yet inscribed, where it is intended. my best Compliments to the Ladies.</p>
