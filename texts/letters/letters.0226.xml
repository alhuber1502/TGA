				     <p>I am gathering together my disjecta Membra &amp; as a specimen I send you the enclosd Ode, of wch perhaps you may remember one Stanza. It is not what <hi rend="italic">I can</hi> make it at
						present, but I wont give myself any more trouble with it, till it has had your desp'rate
						Hooks. but spare it as much as you can, for I dont mean to draw you into any scrape by the
					conclusion of it but shall leave you quite at your liberty to write my Epitaph or no, as you please.
					As soon as you have interlind it send it me back again &amp; dont let any body see it except the President &amp; Tuthill and <hi rend="italic">Old Cardale</hi>
					
					       <hi rend="italic">&amp; the Master.</hi>
					
				     </p>
				     <p>Marcello has set out from Newcastle &amp; is travelling hither as fast as a Northumberland
						Waggon can bring him you must not expect him at Cambridge this fourthnight. Pray is the Thane of
						Glamis come.</p>
				     <p>I wish I could put that good creature Fraser up in his own frank, to transcribe your Ode for me for
					I want it vastly.</p>
				     <p>I have no <hi rend="italic">Lueurs</hi> yet about Hanover. My Lord did speak to Lord Hertford to make me Chaplain to his Embassy. but he was preengaged; tell this
					to no Body but Old Cardale and the Master.</p>
				     <p>I send you also an Epistle wch Folks say Voltaire writ lately to himself, but you must Judge
					whether they are right in their Assertion [ ] .... you must return it in a Post or two.</p>
