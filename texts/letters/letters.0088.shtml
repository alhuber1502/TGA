      <p>I think I have not yet told you how we left that charming place Genoa: How we crossed
         a mountain, all of green marble, called Buchetto:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> How we came to Tortona, and waded through the mud to come to Castel St. Giovanni,
         and there eat mustard and sugar with a dish of crows' gizzards: Secondly, how we passed
         the famous plains</p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>Quà Trebie glaucas salices intersecat undâ, <br /> Arvaque Romanis nobilitata malis. <br /> Visus adhuc amnis veteri de clade rubere <br /> Et suspirantes ducere mæstus aquas; <br /> Maurorumque ala, &amp; nigræ increbrescere turmæ, <br /> Et pulsa Ausonidum ripa sonare fugâ.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      </div>
      <p>Nor, thirdly, how we passed through Piacenza, Parma, Modena, entered the territories
         of the Pope; stayed twelve days at Bologna; crossed the Apennines, and afterwards
         arrived at Florence. None of these things have I told you, nor do I intend to tell
         you, till you ask me some questions concerning them. No not even of Florence itself,
         except that it is as fine as possible, and has every thing in it that can bless the
         eyes. <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> But, before I enter into particulars, you must make your peace both with me and the
         Venus de Medicis, who, let me tell you, is highly and justly offended at you for not
         inquiring, long before this, concerning her symmetry and proportions. [...]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
