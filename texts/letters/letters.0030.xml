				     <p>It rains, 'tis Sunday, this is the country; three circumstances so dull in conjunction with the dulness of my nature are like to give
					birth to an admirable production; I hope you will receive it, as you would a Michaelmas Goose from a Tenant; since I send it, not that
					I believe you have a taste for an awkward fat creature, but because I have no better way of showing my good-will: your name, I assure
					you, has been propagated in these countries by a Convert of yours, one Cambridge; he has brought over
					his whole family to you; they were before pretty good Whigs, but now they are absolute Walpolians: we have hardly any body in the
					Parish, but knows exactly the Dimensions of the hall &amp; Saloon at Houghton, &amp; begins to believe, that the Lanthorn is not quite so great a Consumer of the fat of the land, as disaffected persons have said: for your
					reputation we keep to ourselves that, of your not Hunting, nor drinking Hogan; e'er a one of which
					would be sufficient here to lay your honour in the Dust: I received a little Billet from my dear Horace, as if he had not heard from
					me: whereas I wrote last Sunday; we have not so good an opportunity here, as I could wish, not lying conveniently for the Post; but
					to[morow sennight] I hope to be in town, &amp; not long after at Cambridge.</p>
