         <div class="salute">Dear Mary</div>
      </div>
      <p>The note I inclose to you is for money lent by poor Graves,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> while he lived with me, to a pot-companion of his. we look'd upon it long as a desperate
         debt, but of late have learn'd, that the Man is set up in a way of business, &amp; very
         capable of paying it. the reason I trouble you with it is this. your Cousin <span class="hi">T: Hide</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has several times mention'd it to my Servant <span class="hi">Stephen</span>,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; was so obliging to offer his assistance in getting the money. if he will really
         give himself that trouble, it will be a deed of charity, &amp; I should be very glad of
         his success. you will take care of the note, w<span class="super">ch</span> is already torn &amp; tatter'd with age: if any little expence is incur'd, Graves will
         gladly satisfy it out of the money, &amp; be very thankful.
      </p>
      <p>My shirts<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> begin exceedingly to want company, w<span class="super">ch</span> (I hope) they may shortly expect, &amp; I as much want to get into the North. when you
         send them, you will please to add a bill of my debts to you, &amp; insert the expence
         you were at for what you bought the morning I set out for Hadham:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and I will send the money, &amp; thank you. I know not, whether Dolly<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> will want any farther intelligence from me, before I go. if she does, let her tell
         me soon. she has already an account of the rents of Hand-Alley;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a state of the case with regard to the Conveyance, w<span class="super">ch</span> Worlidge<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> ought to have got ready &amp; sign'd; &amp; the Extract from M<span class="super">rs</span> Rogers's Will. I would wish to send her an account of the Taxes, but have it not
         perfect myself. in the mean time I send her, what appears from the last account (turn
         over). you will give my service to your Mamma, &amp; love to Dolly.

         <p>They all (I think) are allow'd the Tax, except <span class="hi">Tilson, Munt</span>, &amp; <span class="hi">Hatton</span>, but in some cases I really do not know to what it amounts. observe, that what I
            set down belongs to M<span class="super">rs</span> Olliffe &amp; myself jointly: so that you are only to reckon the half of it, as deducted
            from your part of the rents. the bills brought in by the Workmen amount in the whole
            (M<span class="super">r</span> Eyres included) to about 105£.
