         <div class="salute">Dear Sir </div>
      </div>
      <p>My intention is (<span style="font-style:italic">Deo volente</span>) to come to Cambridge on Friday or Saturday next; and shall expect to set out on
         Monday following. I shall write to Mason by to-night's post, who otherwise would expect
         us all Whitsun-week. Pray that the Trent may not intercept us at Newark, for we have
         had infinite rain here, and they say every brook sets up for a river.
      </p>
      <p>I said nothing of Lady M. Lyon, because I thought you knew she had been long despaired
         of. The family I hear now do not go into Scotland till the races are over, nor perhaps
         then, as my lady will be advancing in her pregnancy, and I should not suppose the
         Peats or the Firth very proper in her condition; but women are courageous creatures
         when they are set upon a thing.

      <p>Lord Bute is gone ill into the country with an ague in his eye and a bad stomach.
         Lord Holland is alive and well, and has written three poems; the only line in which,
         that I have heard, is this:
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>'White-liver'd Grenville and self-loving Gower.'</p>
      </div>
      <p>Lord Chatham is â€”, and the Rockinghams are like the brooks that I mentioned above.
         This is all the news that I know.
