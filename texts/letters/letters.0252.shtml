         <div class="salute">Dear Sr</div>
      </div>
      <p>I see &amp; feel the very natural unwillingness you must have to apply to those Persons<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for any thing, that may imply a sort of obligation; &amp; I more strongly see &amp; feel
         the obligation I have to you for being so ready to conquer that reluctance on my account.
         I could not at this distance do otherwise than refer you to Mr M:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (who, I hope, has seen you) for particulars, wch he is better inform'd of than I
         am. I have heard since, that Dr L:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is alive, &amp; thought to be out of danger; but he is a very old Man, &amp; tho' I am glad
         to see we may probably spare you this trouble for the present, I can only look upon
         it as defer'd for a time. Mr Bn<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> so little knew of my intention, that the good Man has wrote to acquaint me of Dr
         L:s illness, &amp; (if I will qualify myself by taking orders,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; I know not what) offers me his utmost endeavours to serve me in the same way, &amp;
         make me <span style="font-style:italic">his Master.</span> you will know before now from Mn,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whether the Man be dead, or dying, or alive &amp; well at last. my zeal (indeed gratitude)
         to Mr B: only could have forced me to put you upon a disagreeable task, &amp; I shall
         be glad to hear, there is no farther occasion for doing any thing. if you find there
         is not, you will be so good to mention nothing of what has past, for I am aware too,
         that my desire to serve him may chance to do hurt; yet was unwilling to omitt any
         thing, that might possibly do good.
      </p>
      <p>I put the thing in the strongest light to you (being obliged to be concise) &amp; I don't
         wonder it appear'd somewhat desperate to your foresight. but in reality Mr B: has
         a pretty-strong natural interest among his own society, &amp; might possibly be chose
         without any <span style="font-style:italic">brigue</span> at all, &amp; spite of opposition. only I would wish to bring it to a certainty. no body
         calls him Jac:te;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I only mean, in case of disputes he might be call'd that, or something as absurd,
         for want of other abuse.
      </p>
      <p>I will go to Town on Friday to see poor Mr Ch:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; at your return hope to thank you at Strawby for your kindness. if I made you no
         excuse before, it was because I thought you might have forgot the occasion of it.
      </p>
