         <p>I thank you for your intelligence about Herculaneum, which was the first news I received of it. I
					have since turned over Monsignor Baiardi's book, where I have learned how many grains of modern wheat
					the Roman Congius, in the Capitol, holds, and how many thousandth parts of an inch the Greek foot consisted of more (or less, for I
					forget which) than our own. He proves also by many affecting examples, that an Antiquary may be mistaken: That, for any thing any body
					knows, this place under ground might be some other place, and not Herculaneum; but nevertheless, that he can shew for certain, that it
					was this place and no other place; that it is hard to say which of the several Hercules's was the founder; therefore (in the third
					volume) he promises to give us the memoirs of them all; and after that, if we do not know what to think of the matter, he will tell us.
					There is a great deal of wit too, and satire and verses, in the book, which is intended chiefly for the information of the French King,
					who will be greatly edified without doubt.</p>
         <p>I am much obliged to you also for Voltaire's performance; it is very unequal, as he is apt to be in
					all but his dramas, and looks like the work of a man that will admire his retreat and his Leman-Lake no longer than till he finds an
					opportunity to leave it: However, though there be many parts which I do not like, yet it is in several places excellent, and every
					where above mediocrity. As you have the politeness to pretend impatience, and desire I would communicate, and all that, I annex a piece
					of the Prophecy; which must be true at least, as it was wrote so many hundred years after the
					events.</p>
