				     <p>Poor Mr Chute has now had the Gout for these five days with such a degree of pain &amp; uneasiness, as he never felt before. whether
					to attribute it to Dr La Cour's forcing medecines, or to a little cold he got as soon as he came
					hither, I know not, but for above forty hours it seem'd past all human suffering, &amp; he lay screaming like a Man upon the rack. the
					torture was so great, that (against my judgement &amp; even his own) he was forced to have recourse to [an] infusion of Poppy-heads, wch Cocchi
					 used to give him, &amp; in [half] an hours time was easy, fell
					into a gentle perspiration, [&amp;] slept many hours. this was the night before last, &amp; all
					yesterday he continued chearful &amp; in spirits. at night (as he expected) the pain returned, not so violent, but in more places, for
					now it is in one foot, both knees, &amp; one hand, and I hourly dread it will increase again to its former rage. if any thing sudden
					happen, who can I send to? here is no assistance nearer than a Dr Langrish at Winchester, of whom he
					has no great opinion. as to Lacour he is enraged against him, &amp; looks upon him as the cause of all he suffers. I can not think
					there is any danger, for tho' with all this he is at times in a high Fever, yet it seems to depend upon the Gout entirely, increasing
					&amp; abating with the pain. but if anything unexpected happen, here are no body but myself &amp; Muntz in the house, would you advise to send to Mrs Pawlet, or to whom? you will oblige me, if you will
					answer me in a loose paper, for he must see your Letter. it will be a charity too to insert any thing of news, or whatever you please
					to tell us, for when he gets any respite from pain, he is capable &amp; desirous of entertainment, &amp; talks with an eagerness of
					spirits, that seems to make part of his distemper. pray tell us how Mr Man does.</p>
