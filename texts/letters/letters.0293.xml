            <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I have received the draught you were so good to send me, &amp; the money is paid. you apprehend too much from my resolutions about
					writing: they are only made to be broken, &amp; after all it will be just as the maggot bites. you have a very mean opinion of the
						Epick, if you think it consists only in laying out a Plan. in four &amp; twenty years at a moderate
					computation I may have finish'd twelve books, &amp; nine years after I hope to publish. I shall then
					be 74 years old &amp; I shall get 500Â£ for the copy to make me easy for the remainder of my days.
					somebody has directed a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Revd</hi> Mr. G: at Strawberry-Hill, wch was sent me yesterday hither. it is anonymous, consists of above 9 pages, all about the Bard, &amp; if I would hear as much more about his
					Companion, I am to direct to the Posthouse at Andover. I do not know but I may have that curiosity,
					for his observations (whoever it is) are not nonsense. he takes the liberty of a Person unknown, &amp; treats me with abundance of
					freedom. I guess it to be some <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> Clergyman. Mr Brown &amp; I join in our best compliments to Mrs
					Wharton.</p>
