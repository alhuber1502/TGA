					       <salute>My dear Doctor</salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p> It happen'd, that I was in London at the time, when St: received your letter relating to Mr. L:s
					request. as my name was mention'd in it, I ought to make my excuses to you as well as he, wch it is indeed easy to do, as I could by no
					means ask any thing but thro' him, &amp; (tho' this had been in my power) it would have been a very bad plea to say, my Ld, you have
					done me a very unexpected favour not long since; &amp; therefore I must beg you to do another at my desire for a Friend of mine. but
					the truth is, at this time our application could not have had any success, as our Principal would certainly never apply to three
					different Persons, with whom he has no connection; nor care to be refused, or even obliged by them. the inside of things can not be
					well explain'd by letters; but if you saw it, you would immediately see in its full light the impracticability of the thing.
				</p>
				     <p>I am lately return'd from a six weeks ramble thro' Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Monmouthsh:re
					Herefordsh:re &amp; Shropshire, five of the most beautiful counties in the kingdom. the very light, &amp; principal feature in my
					journey was the river <hi rend="italic">Wye,</hi> wch I descended in a boat for near 40 miles from Ross to Chepstow: its banks are a
					succession of nameless wonders: one out of many you may see not ill described by Mr. Whateley in his
						<hi rend="italic">Observations on Gardening</hi> under the name of the <hi rend="italic">New-Weir</hi>: he has also touch'd upon two
					others, <hi rend="italic">Tinterne-Abbey,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Persfield</hi> (Mr Morris's).
					both of them famous scenes; &amp; both on the Wye. Monmouth, a town I never heard mention'd, lies on the same river in a vale, that is
					the delight of my eyes, &amp; the very seat of pleasure. the vale of Abergavenny, Ragland &amp; Chepstow-Castles, Ludlow,
					Malvern-hills, Hampton Court near Lemster, the Leasowes,
						Hagley, the three Cities &amp; their Cathedrals, &amp; lastly
						Oxford (where I past two days in my return with great satisfaction), are the rest of my
					acquisitions, &amp; no bad harvest to my thinking. I have a journal written by the companion of my
					travels, that serves to recall &amp; fix the fading images of these things.</p>
				     <p>I desire to hear of your health, &amp; that of your family. are Miss Wh:n &amp; Miss Peggy quite recover'd? my respects to Mrs.
					Wharton &amp; them.</p>
