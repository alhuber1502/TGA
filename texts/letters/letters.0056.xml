				     <p>You can never weary me with repetition of any thing, that makes me sensible of your kindness: since that has been the only Idea of
					any social happiness that I have ever received almost, &amp; which (begging your pardon for thinking so differently from you in such
					cases) I would by no means have parted with for an exemption from all the uneasinesses mixed with it. but it would be unjust to imagine
					my taste was any rule for yours, for which reason my letters are shorter &amp; less frequent than they would be, had I any materials
					but myself to entertain you with. love, &amp; brown Sugar must be a poor regale for one of your Goût, &amp; alas! you know I am by
					trade a Grocer. Scandal (if I had any) is a merchandize, you don't profess dealing in; now &amp; then
					indeed, &amp; to oblige a friend you may perhaps slip a little out of your Pocket, as a decayed Gentlewoman would a piece of right
					Mechlin, or a little quantity of run Tea; but this only now &amp; then, not to make a practise of it. Monsters, appertaining to this
					Climate, you have seen already both wet &amp; dry: so you see within how narrow bounds my Pen is circumscribed; &amp; the whole
					contents of my share in our Correspondence may be reduced under the two heads of 1: You, 2: I: the first is indeed a subject to
					expatiate upon, but [you might] laugh at me for talking of what I do not understand; the second is as
					tiny, as tiresome, wherefore you shall hear no more of it, till you come to Finis. Ashton was here last night, he goes to morrow, he
					bid me farewell, &amp; drank a health in Ale &amp; small, to our meeting hereafter in a happy Eternity. Mrs Ward has bought her a
					silver Chamberpot. Mademoiselle Quimbeau (that was) is weary of her new husband, &amp; has sent a petit billet to a gentleman to pray
					he would come, &amp; ravish her. there is a curious woman here that spins Glass, &amp; makes short Aprons, &amp; furbelow'd petticoats
					of it, a very genteel wear for summer, &amp; discover's all the motions of the limbs to great
					advantage. she is a successour of Jack, the Aple dumpling Spinner's: my Duck has eat a Snail, &amp;c: &amp; I am</p>
