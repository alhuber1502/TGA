         <p>I was just going to write to you in opposition to a couple of very weighty reasons; one, that you did not bid me, &amp; t'other, that
					I had nothing to say; but, alas! what are reasons against one's inclinations, for you know in such a case a feather at any time will
					weigh down Lead; but you by instinct knowing my situation, were so good as to supply me with the cause, tho' not with materials: if you
					never were to tell me any fresher piece of News, than that with which you end your little Modicum, I should be well enough content, for
					tho' I heard it every day I should wonder as much as ever, &amp; it would never be the less agreable for repetition; I rely wholly upon
					you, my correspondent, for the truth of it, as the only person, who can tell, what passes in that little country, where my concerns
					lie. my Motions at present (which you ask after the particulars of) are much like those of a Pendulum, or (Dr Longically speaking) oscillatory, I swing from Chapell or Hall home, &amp; from home to chapell or hall; all the
					strange incidents that happen in my journeys &amp; returns I shall be sure to acquaint you with; the most wonderful that I have been
					able to pick up, as yet, is, that it rains exceedingly; this has refresh'd the prospect very
					agreeably, as the way for the most part lies between green fields on either hand, terminated with buildings at some distance; Seats, I
					presume; &amp; they seem of great antiquity: the roads are very good, being, as I suspect, the work of Julius CÃ¦sar's army, for they
					still preserve in many places the appearances of a pavement in pretty good repair, &amp; if they were not so near home, might perhaps
					be as much admired as the Via Appia, that we hear so much cried up: there are at present several rivulets to be crossed, &amp; which
					serve to enliven the view all round; the country is exceeding fruitful in Ravens, &amp; such black Cattle. but not to tire you with my travels, You must know Mr Turner is come down,
					his list is vastly near being full, notwishstanding which, &amp; the great cares &amp; duties
					attending his office, he says, he thinks to go to Paris every Year. I think too to go to town the week after next, &amp; am</p>
