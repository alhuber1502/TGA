      </div>
      <p>What do You chuse I should think of a whole Year's Silence? have you absolutely forgot
         me, or do you not reflect, that it is from yourself alone I can have any Information
         concerning You? I do not find myself inclined to forget you: the same Regard for your
         Person, the same Desire of seeing you again I felt when we parted still continues
         with me as fresh as ever. don't wonder then if in spite of Appearances I try to flatter
         myself with the Hopes of finding Sentiments something of the same kind however buried
         in some dark Corner of your Heart, &amp; perhaps more than half extinguish'd by long Absence,
         &amp; various Cares of a different Nature. I will not alarm your Indolence with a long
         Letter. my Demands are only three, &amp; may be answer'd in as many Words. how You do?
         where You are? &amp; When You return? if you chuse to add anything further it will be
         a Work of Superer â€“ I will not write so long a Word entire, least I fatigue your Delicacy,
         &amp; you may think it incumbent on you to answer it by another of equal Dimensions. You
         believe me, I hope, with great Sincerity Yours 
      </p>

            People make to one another) wait upon Mr Whithed. he will be the most travel'd Gentleman
            in Hampshire.
