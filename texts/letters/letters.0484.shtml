      </div>
      <p>I am desired to tell you, that if you <span style="font-style:italic">still</span> continue to be tired of residence, or are in any way moderately ambitious, or covetous,
         there never was a better opportunity. the D: of G: is extremely well inclined, &amp; you
         know, who is at hand to give his assistance: but the apparent channel should be your
         Friend, Ld H:sse, who is upon good terms. this was said to me in so friendly a way,
         that I could not but acquaint you of it immediately.
      </p>
      <p>I have made enquiry, since I came hither on a subject, that seem'd much to take up
         your thoughts, &amp; (I do assure you) find not the least grounds to give you uneasiness.
         it was mere distemper &amp; nothing more.
      </p>
