         <div class="salute">My Dear Doctor</div>
      </div>
      <p>I do remember &amp; shall ever remember, as I ought, your extreme kindness in offering
         to be present, &amp; to assist me in the <span style="font-style:italic">perilous hour.</span> when I received your letter, I was pleased to find, I had done every thing almost,
         that you advised. the fault lay in deferring matters too long. upon inspection they
         found no reason to apprehend a Fistula, but the piles only in an extreme degree, that
         threaten'd mortification. 9 or 10 strokes of the lancet, &amp; the application of a caustic,
         with fomentations innumerable I suffer'd manfully: indeed the pain in idea is much
         greater than in reality, &amp; now I am glad, I know it. it is certain, I am better at
         present, than I had been in at least a year before the operation. I should tell you,
         that for some days before I submitted to it, I had taken soap in large quantities,
         &amp; for ought I know the inflammation might be rather increased by it. Dr. Whytt<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (I remember) speaking of the use of Limewater &amp; Soap, says, that if the Patient be
         subject to the piles, he must omitt the latter. towards the end of my confinement,
         during wch (you may believe) I lived on nothing, came the Gout in one foot, but so
         tame you might have stroked it;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> such a <span style="font-style:italic">Minikin</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you might have play'd with it. in 3 or 4 days it disappear'd.</p>
      <p>It was true, as Stonhewer told you, that I had a great tendency towards Old-Park &amp;
         Hart-le-pool: but on prudent consideration I find, I can not well afford it, &amp; must
         defer that pleasure to another summer.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Minikin &amp; I act upon the same principles: she can not be a river, nor I a Traveller,
         without money. if we had but a <span style="font-style:italic">head,</span> we should both of us make a figure in the world.</p>
      <p>Mason does not seem very impatient,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for he writes word, that he is busy in modelling antique vases in clay, &amp; in reading
         a course of ecclesiastical History, when I expected <span style="font-style:italic">consummation,</span> &amp; was praying heaven to give him a good &amp; gentle Gouverness: no Man wants such a
         thing more in all senses; but his greatest wants do not make him move a foot the faster,
         nor has he properly speaking any thing one can call a passion about him, except a
         little malice &amp; revenge.</p>
      <p>Our Election here is in Westminster-Hall:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but it is not likely that any great matter can be done in it till Michaelmas-Term
         next. in the meantime Ld Sandw: &amp; his Friends do what they can to keep up an interest
         &amp; a bustle. here is a poor Scribler, that he hires to write a weekly paper call'd
         <span style="font-style:italic">the Scrutator,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who by abuse of characters does all in his power to provoke people: but can not so
         much as get himself answer'd. I could not find any one in Town, that ever heard of
         it (tho' the subject is well known there), &amp; if any body saw its name in the advertisements,
         I believe, they only took it for a <span style="font-style:italic">Scrutore</span> to be sold. the Nation is in the same hands as the University, &amp; really does not
         make so manful a resistance. grumble indeed every one does, but since Wilkes's affair
         they fall off their metal, &amp; seem to shrink under the brazen hand of Norton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; his Collegues. I hear there will be no parliament till after Christmas.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if the French should be so unwise as to suffer the Spanish Court to go on in their
         present measures (for they refuse to pay the ransom of Manilla,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; have driven away our Logwood-cutters<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> already) down go their friends the Ministry, &amp; all the schemes of Right Divine &amp;
         Prerogative; and this is perhaps the best chance we have. are you not struck with
         the great similarity there is between the first years of Charles the first, &amp; the
         present times? who would have thought it possible five years ago?</p>
      <p>That old Rogue Ld Bath is dead at last.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I understood the contest for his spoils lay between your noble Friend at Raby<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Mr Coleman,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Comick Poet, but whether they are fallen to either of them I have not heard as
         yet. pray what is the policy of that castle? the elder Brother lives more than usual
         in the country, as if he were not in the best humour with his Friends at Court, &amp;
         the younger<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been at times an Orator in the opposition? have they been disobliged, or do they
         fear to disoblige their former friends, who may come into play again?</p>
      <p>Two more volumes of Buffon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are come over: I mention them in case you chuse to have them. I know of nothing else,
         except half a dozen new works of that inexhaustible, eternal, entertaining Scribler
         Voltaire,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who at last (I fear) will go to heaven, for to him entirely it is owing, that the
         King of France &amp; his Council have review'd &amp; set aside the decision of the Parliament
         of Thoulouse in the affair of Calas.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the poor Man, 'tis true, has been broke on the wheel long ago: but his Widow &amp; wretched
         family may have some reparation &amp; his Murtherers may smart a little for it. you see
         a Scribler may be of some use in the world!</p>
      <p>If you see Stonhewer at his return from Buxton, be so good to tell him, that there
         will be only 200 copies of Ld Herbert's Life<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> printed, half of which are for Ld Powis,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the rest will be given away only. if I happen to have two (wch I do not expect)
         he shall have one of them.</p>
      <p>Ah! poor James Lyon!<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> —how do the – Family<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> bear it? my best respects to the Lady of Old-Park (the Dutchess I should say) &amp; Lady
         Mary,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c: I hope they are all well. are Mr and Mrs Jonathan<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with you? do you say your prayers o' nights?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
