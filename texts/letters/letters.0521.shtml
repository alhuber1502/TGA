         is, that the text be accurately printed, &amp; therefore whoever corrects the press, should
         have some acquaintance with the Greek, Latin, &amp; Italian, as well as the English, tongues.
         let the order stand thus, unless you have begun to print already: if so, it is indifferent
         to me.</p>
