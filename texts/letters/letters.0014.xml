				     <p>In consideration of the time your Petitioner has past in your honours Service, as also on account of the great Services your
					petitioner's relations have had the honour to perform for your Honour's Ancestors; since it is well known that your petitrs
					Grandmother's Aunt's Cousin-german had ye honour to pull out your honour's great Uncle's Wive's brother's hollow tooth; as also, to go
					further backwards, your Petrs relation was Physician to King Cadwallader, one of your highnesses fore-fathers, and cured him of a
					fishes-bone, which had stuck in his throat fifteen years, &amp; three days and would neither come up, nor down: also the Emperour
					Maximus, a very near relation of your serene Haughtinesses, entertain'd your Petitrs progenitor in his army, as a Jester, who is said
					to have had so much wit, that he could devour ten peck-loaves at a Meal, &amp; toss off as many hog-sheads of strong beer without
					taking breath: I could enumerate more than all this, but hope, this will be sufficient to prevail upon your generosity to make me your
					first Minister, and Confidant</p>
				     <p>And your Petr shall <hi rend="italic">ever pray</hi>
				     </p>
				     <p>Thou hast been for this month, like an auctioneer's mallet, just a-coming! just a-coming! and pray what has next Thursday in it, more
					than last Wednesday, to make me expect you with any tolerable Certainty? when these two eyes behold thee, I question, whether I shall
					believe them: three long months is a long while, for a poor lone woman to bear; and I have born, &amp;
					born, and been fub'd off, &amp; fub'd off from this day to that day by you, thou Honey-suckle Villain (as Mrs Quickly says) oh! thou
					art an infinitive thing upon my score of impatience. remember you are a day in my debt for every hour
					you have made me wait, &amp; I shall come upon you for the payment, &amp; perhaps with interest:â€”I begin to bear my Crest aloft
					when I hear of your pride; I dare not tell Ashton anything about it, for he hopes to see you behave
					with great affability to every body, &amp; you'll have many lectures upon that Subject: I begin to pity the poor Man, that is to be
					with you: he is extremely modest, &amp; as humble as you could wish; you may snub him with a look; I fancy he will intrude very little.
					make hast &amp; pack up your things, the Coach is at the door: drive away to [...]
