         <p>It is doubtless an encouragement to continue writing to you, when you tell me you answer me with pleasure: I have another reason which would make me very copious, had I anything to say; it is, that I write to you
					with equal pleasure, though not with equal spirits, nor with like plenty of materials: please to subtract then so much for spirit, and
					so much for matter; and you will find me, I hope, neither so slow, nor so short, as I might otherwise seem. Besides, I had a mind to
					send you the remainder of Agrippina, that was lost in a wilderness of papers. Certainly you do her too much honour: she seemed to me to
					talk like an <hi rend="italic">Oldboy,</hi>
					 all in figures and mere poetry, instead of nature and the language of real passion. Do you remember
						<hi rend="italic">Approchez-vous, </hi>
            <hi rend="italic">Neron</hi>
					 —Who would not rather have thought of that half line than all Mr. Rowe's flowers of eloquence? However, you will find the remainder here at the end in an outrageous long speech: it
					was begun above four years ago (it is a misfortune you know my age, else I might have added), when I was very young. Poor West put a
					stop to that tragic torrent he saw breaking in upon him:–have a care, I warn you, not to set
					open the flood-gate again, lest it should drown you and me and the bishop and all.</p>
         <p>I am very sorry to hear you treat philosophy and her followers like a parcel of monks and hermits, and think myself obliged to
					vindicate a profession I honour, bien que je n'en tienne pas boutique (as mad. Sevigné says). The
					first man that ever bore the name, if you remember, used to say, that life was like the Olympic games
					(the greatest public assembly of his age and country), where some came to show their strength and agility of body, as the champions;
					others, as the musicians, orators, poets, and historians, to show their excellence in those arts; the traders, to get money; and the
					better sort, to enjoy the spectacle, and judge of all these. They did not then run away from society for fear of its temptations: they
					passed their days in the midst of it: conversation was their business: they cultivated the arts of persuasion, on purpose to show men
					it was their interest, as well as their duty, not to be foolish, and false, and unjust; and that too in many instances with success:
					which is not very strange; for they showed by their life that their lessons were not impracticable; and that pleasures were no
					temptations, but to such as wanted a clear perception of the pains annexed to them. But I have done preaching à la Grecque. Mr.
						Ratcliffe made a shift to behave very rationally without their instructions, at a season which they
					took a great deal of pains to fortify themselves and others against: one would not desire to lose one's head with a better grace. I am
					particularly satisfied with the humanity of that last embrace to all the people about him. Sure it must be somewhat embarrassing to die
					before so much good company!</p>
         <p>You need not fear but posterity will be ever glad to know the absurdity of their ancestors: the foolish will be glad to know they
					were as foolish as they, and the wise will be glad to find themselves wiser. You will please all the world then; and if you recount
					miracles you will be believed so much the sooner. We are pleased when we wonder; and we believe
					because we are pleased. Folly and wisdom, and wonder and pleasure, join with me in desiring you would continue to entertain them:
					refuse us if you can.</p>
