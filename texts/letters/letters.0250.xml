         <p>It is a good number of years since I applied to you on a like occasion. your ready compliance with my
					desire at that time gives me confidence to do so at present, but how far it is practicable or proper for you to satisfy me in this case
					I leave entirely to your own judgement. </p>
         <p>Dr Long, the Master of Pembroke Hall, (I am told) is either dying or dead. Mr Brown, the President &amp; Sen: Fellow, is
					a Person entirely unknown to the World, whom those few, that know, love &amp; esteem; &amp; to whom I myself have a thousand
					obligations. his interest in the College is considerable; but as among 11 or 12 Fellows, who elect, there are (you will not doubt)
					some, that will regard their own interest rather more than his, a word from you to Mr F:, or the D: of
						Bd, or any other great Man, may contribute to recommend him, &amp; incline these doubtful People to
					vote for him. Mr Mason, who is himself qualified to be Master, &amp; might probably enough succeed, I am fully persuaded (tho' you will
					think there is not common Sense in the assertion) will do every thing to further Mr Brown's election. he (if you will let him know,
					when you are at home,) will wait upon you, &amp; give you any necessary information. I can answer for Mr Bs Principles in Government,
					as I can for my own, that they are those of every true &amp; rational Whig. perhaps you may hear the contrary said; &amp; I ought not
					to conceal from you, that he is one of the plainest, worthiest &amp; most honest Men I ever met with, but this ought to be a secret.
					the Antagonist I apprehend is a Mr Addison, a <hi rend="italic">Creature</hi> of your Uncle &amp; prefer'd by him (do not think, I say this, to add a spur to you, for I flatter myself, it is not
					necessary) he will have the Bp of Chester's assistance, &amp; that of the Heads of Colleges, (who know
					him for a staunch Man,) &amp; consequently, of the D: of Newc:le. the thing (supposing Dr L: dead) must
					be decided in 8 or 10 days, I believe, the obligation you will lay upon me by this, will be as great or greater than if I myself were
					the immediate object of your kindness. but I repeat, that You only are to judge, how far it can answer the end I propose. Mason comes
					to Town from Tunbridge today, &amp; will stay there, I imagine, some days.</p>

            <p>When I mention'd the D: of Bd, I forgot that Mr Franklyn may have some weight there. he is a mortal
						enemy of my Mr Brown.
