         <div class="salute">My Dear Wharton</div>
      </div>
      <p>Shall I be expeditious enough to bring you the News of the Peace, before you meet
         with it in the Papers? not the Peace of Aix la Chapelle,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mother of Proclamations &amp; of Fireworks, that lowers the Price of Oranges &amp; Malaga-Sack,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; enhaunces that of Poor-Jack<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and barrel'd Cod:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> no, nor the Peace between Adil-Shah &amp; the Great Mogol;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but the Peace of Pembroke<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> sign'd between the high &amp; mighty Prince Roger, surnamed the Long, Lord of the great
         Zodiack, the Glass Uranium, &amp; the Chariot that goes without Horses,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on the one Part; &amp; the most noble James Brown,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the most serene Theophilus Peele,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and the most profound Nehemiah May,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c: on the other.
      </p>
      <p>In short without farther Preliminaries Knowles,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mason,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Tuthill<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are elected, and the last of them is actually here on the Spot, as you will shortly
         hear from himself. the Negotiations, that preceded this wonderful Event, are inexplicable.
         the Success of the Affair was extremely uncertain but the very Night before it, &amp;
         had come to nothing, if Browne fixed &amp; obstinate as a little Rock had not resisted
         the Sollicitations of Smith,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Smart,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> almost quarrel'd with Peele and May, &amp; given up, as in a Huff, the Liveing of Tylney,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to wch he had that Morning been presented. I say, this seem'd to them to be done
         in a Huff, but was in reality a Thing he had determined to do, be the Event of the
         Election what it would. they were desirous of electing two, as the Master proposed,
         Knowles &amp; Mason, or Mason &amp; Gaskarth,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for they were sure he would never admit Tuthill, as he had so often declared it.
         however, I say, Brown continued stedfast, that all three should come in, or none at
         all; &amp; when they met next day, he begun by resigning Tylney, &amp; then desired the Master
         would either put an End to their long Disputes himself, as they intreated him; or
         else they would refer the whole to a Visitor, &amp; did conjure him to call one in, as
         soon as possible. the rest did not contradict him, tho' the Proposal was much against
         their real Inclinations. so Roger believing them unanimous (after some few Pribbles
         &amp; Prabbles)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> said, well then, if it be for ye Good of ye College – but you intend Knowles shall
         be Senior? – To be sure, Master – Well then – &amp; so they proceeded to Election &amp; all
         was over in a few Minutes. I do believe, that Roger despairing now of a Visitor to
         his Mind, &amp; advised by all his Acquaintance (among whom I reckon Keene,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whose Acquaintance I have cultivated with the same Views you mention'd in your Letter
         to Brown) to finish the Matter, had been for some Months determined to do so, but
         not till he made a last Effort. he made it indeed, but not having Sagacity enough
         to find out, how near carrying his Point he was; being ignorant of the Weakness of
         a Part of his College, &amp; they not cunning, or perhaps not dishonest enough, to discover
         it to him, he thought he had miss'd his Aim, &amp; so gave it up without farther Struggling.
         I hope you will be glad to see so good an End of an Affair you give Birth to: Brown
         is quite happy, &amp; we vastly glad to be obliged to the only Man left among them, that
         one would care to be obliged to. there are two more Fellowships remain to be filled
         up at the Commencement. by the Way Tuthill has been just holding a Candle – not to
         the Devil, but to the Master, as he was reading some Papers in Hall; and the Boys
         peep'd in at the Screens to see it, &amp; to laugh.

      <p>Keene is most sadly <span style="font-style:italic">implicated</span> in the beginning of his Reign about an Election,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; I am of his Cabinet-Council, hitherto for the Reasons you<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wot of, &amp; now because I can't help it. but I am rather tired of College-Details (as
         I doubt not, you are) &amp; so I leave this Story to be recorded by the Annalists of Peterhouse;
         &amp; let Historians of equal Dignity tell of the Triumphs of Chappy,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Installations,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Visitations, &amp; other memorable Events, that distinguish &amp; adorn his glorious
         Reign.

      <p>You ask for some Account of Books. the principal I can tell you of is a Work of the
         Presid:t Montesquieu's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Labour of 20 Years. it is call'd, L'Esprit des Loix, 2 V: 4to, printed at Geneva.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he lays down the Principles on wch are founded the three Sorts of Government, Despotism,
         the limited Monarchic, &amp; the Republican, &amp; shews how from thence are deduced the Laws
         &amp; Customs, by wch they are guided &amp; maintained; the Education proper to each Form,
         the influences of Climate, Situation, Religion, &amp;c: on the Minds of particular Nations,
         &amp; on their Policy. the Subject (you see) is as extensive as Mankind; the Thoughts
         perfectly new,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> generally admirable, as they are just, sometimes a little too refined: in short there
         are Faults, but such as an ordinary Man could never have committed: the Style very
         lively &amp; concise (consequently sometimes obscure) it is the Gravity of Tacitus (whom
         he admires) temper'd with the Gayety &amp; Fire of a Frenchman.
      </p>
      <p>The Time of Night will not suffer me to go on, but I will write again in a Week. my
         best Compliments to Mrs Wharton, &amp; your Family. I am ever
