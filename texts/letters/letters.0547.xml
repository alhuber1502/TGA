				     <p>Oh wicked Scroddles! there you have gone &amp; told my <hi rend="italic">Arcanum Arcanorum</hi>
					 to that leaky Mortal Palgrave, who never conceals any thing he is trusted with; &amp; there have I
					been forced to write to him, &amp; (to bribe him to silence) have told him, how much I confided in his taciturnity, &amp; twenty lies
					beside, the guilt of wch must fall on you at the last account. seriously you have done very wrong: sure you don't remember the
					imprudence of Dr G:, who is well-known to that rogue in Pickadilly,
					&amp; who at any time may be denounced to the Party concern'd, wch five shillings reward may certainly bring about. hitherto luckily
					nobody has taken any notice of it, nor (I hope) ever will.</p>
				     <p>Dr Balguy tells me you talk of Cambridge. come away then forthwith, when your Christmas-duties &amp; mince-pies are over: for what
					can you do at Aston making snowballs all January. here am I just return'd from London: I have seen St:r whose looks are much mended, &amp; he has leave to break up for a fortnight, &amp; is gone to Bath. poor Dr Hurd has undergone a
					painful operation: they say, it was not a Fistula, but something very like it. he is now in a way to be well, &amp; by this time goes
					abroad again. Delaval was confined two months with a like disorder. he suffered three times under the hands of Hawkins, &amp; tho' he is now got out, &amp; walking the streets, does not think himself cured, &amp; still complains
					of uneasy sensations. nobody but I, &amp; Fraser &amp; Dr Ross (who (it is said) is just made Dean of
					Ely) are quite well. Dr Thomas of Christ's is Bp of Carlisle. don't you feel a spice of
					concupiscence?</p>
