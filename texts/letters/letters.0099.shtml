      <p>I am to-day just returned from Alba, a good deal fatigued; for you know the Appian
         is somewhat tiresome. We dined at Pompey's; he indeed was gone for a few days to his
         Tusculan, but, by the care of his Villicus, we made an admirable meal. We had the
         dugs of a pregnant sow, a peacock, a dish of thrushes, a noble scarus just fresh from
         the Tyrrhene, and some conchylia of the Lake with garum sauce: For my part I never
         eat better at Lucullus's table. We drank half a dozen cyathi a-piece of ancient Alban
         to Pholoë's health; and, after bathing, and playing an hour at ball, we mounted our
         essedum again, and proceeded up the mount to the temple. The priests there entertained
         us with an account of a wonderful shower of birds eggs, that had fallen two days before,
         which had no sooner touched the ground, but they were converted into gudgeons; as
         also that the night past a dreadful voice had been heard out of the Adytum, which
         spoke Greek during a full half hour, but no body understood it. But quitting my Romanities,
         to your great joy and mine, let me tell you, in plain English, that we come from Albano.
         The present town lies within the inclosure of Pompey's Villa in ruins. The Appian
         way runs through it, by the side of which, a little farther, is a large old tomb,
         with five pyramids upon it, which the learned suppose to be the burying-place of the
         family, because they do not know whose it can be else. But the vulgar assure you it
         is the sepulchre of the Curiatii, and by that name (such is their power) it goes.
         One drives to Castel Gondolfo, a house of the Pope's, situated on the top of one of
         the Collinette, that forms a brim to the bason, commonly called the Alban lake. It
         is seven miles round; and directly opposite to you, on the other side, rises the Mons
         Albanus, much taller than the rest, along whose side are still discoverable (not to
         common eyes) certain little ruins of the old Alba longa. They had need be very little,
         as having been nothing but ruins ever since the days of Tullus Hostilius. On its top
         is a house of the Constable Colona's, where stood the temple of Jupiter Latialis.
         At the foot of the hill Gondolfo, are the famous outlets of the lake, built with hewn
         stone, a mile and a half under ground. Livy, you know, amply informs us of the foolish
         occasion of this expence, and gives me this opportunity of displaying all my erudition,
         that I may appear considerable in your eyes. This is the prospect from one window
         of the palace. From another you have the whole Campagna, the City, Antium, and the
         Tyrrhene sea (twelve miles distant) so distinguishable, that you may see the vessels
         sailing upon it. All this is charming. Mr. Walpole says, our memory sees more than
         our eyes in this country. Which is extremely true; since, for realities, Windsor,
         or Richmond Hill, is infinitely preferable to Albano or Frescati. I am now at home,
         and going to the window to tell you it is the most beautiful of Italian nights, which,
         in truth, are but just begun (so backward has the spring been here, and every where
         else, they say.) There is a moon! there are stars for you! Do not you hear the fountain?
         Do not you smell the orange flowers? That building yonder is the Convent of S. Isidore;
         and that eminence, with the cypress trees and pines upon it, the top of M. Quirinal.
         This is all true, and yet my prospect is not two hundred yards in length. We send
         you some Roman inscriptions to entertain you. The first two are modern, transcribed
         from the Vatican library by Mr. Walpole.

      <p>Mine is ancient, and I think not less curious. It is exactly transcribed from a sepulchral
         marble at the villa Giustiniani. I put stops to it, when I understand it.
