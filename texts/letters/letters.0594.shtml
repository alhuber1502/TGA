The MS. Letters would be of some
         Value, if the Transcriber had better understood what he was about: but there are so
         many words mistaken, so many omitted, that the Sense can often only be made out by
         Conjecture. </p>
      <p>Does not recollect that they have been printed in any of the Collections: but thinks
         he has seen several of them (the Originals) in the Harleian Library.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Lord Herbert<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> plainly had seen them, &amp; (as far as they goe) has made them the Foundation of his
         History.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> They serve to shew, as he says, That the Cardinal,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in his Dispatches was more copious than eloquent.</p>
      <p>The Instructions to Tunstall<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Wingfield,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> after the Battle of Pavia, &amp; the King's Directions after he had signed the Peace
         with Francis,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are most remarkable.</p>
