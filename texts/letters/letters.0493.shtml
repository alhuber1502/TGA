      <p>[ ] A professor at Edinburgh<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has published an Essay on the History of Civil Society, but I have not seen it. It
         is a fault common to almost all our Scotch authors, that they are too metaphysical:
         I wish they would learn to speak more to the heart, and less to the understanding;
         but alas! this is a talent which heaven only can bestow: Whereas the philosophic spirit
         (as we call it) is merely artificial and level to the capacity of every man, who has
         much patience, a little learning, and no taste.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> [ ]</p>
