					       <dateline>Camb. 28 Aug. 1757.</dateline>
					       <salute> Dear Sir, </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p> I write this to be conveyed to you by M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason. We were together, when your favour of the 25<hi rend="super">th</hi> arrived, and laughed very heartily at the judgments of your great men and great women. Poor
					people, it is not for them to understand what you write. But without understanding, they will learn to admire, of their Betters. Every
					body here, that knows anything of such things, applauds the Odes. And the readers of Pindar dote upon them.</p>
				     <p> I am truly concerned for what you tell me of your indisposition. You must abstain from books for the present, and use all the
					exercise you can. I should fancy, if you took a Post-chaise and went to dine with Mason at Kensington,
					it would be a relief to you. His Caractacus mends daily, and will come to good in the end, in spite of Lords and Ladies, who will not
					like it.</p>
				     <p> I set forward on my journey tomorrow. If I find a day of leisure, or rather of <hi>ennui</hi>, I may attempt to enliven it by
					writing to you again. In the mean time take care of your health and believe me,</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute> Dear Sir,<lb/> Your very affectionate friend and<lb/> humble Servant </salute>
					       <signed> R. Hurd. </signed>
				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p> P.S. M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Brown to whom I shew'd the paragraph in you Letter, sends
						compliments.</p>
