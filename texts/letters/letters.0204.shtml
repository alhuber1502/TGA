      <p>I am obliged on the sudden to come hither to see my poor mother who is in a condition
         between Life &amp; Death, tho' (I think) much nearer the latter. yet I could not help
         telling you, I had received your Letter, &amp; am pleased to find, I was in the wrong.
         you may be sure, I was not willing to think you so. do what you please about the title,
         if it is time; but it seems to me the less of Puff or Ostentation it has, the better
         it will be, even for Dodsley.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> excuse my brevity,</p>
