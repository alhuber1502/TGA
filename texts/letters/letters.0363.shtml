      <p>Though you have had but a melancholy employment, it is worthy of envy, and (I hope)
         will have all the success it deserves. It was the best and most natural method of
         cure, and such as could not have been administered by any but your gentle hand. I
         thank you for communicating to me what must give you so much satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>I too was reading M. D'Alembert, and (like you) am totally disappointed in his Elements.
         I could only taste a little of the first course: it was dry as a stick, hard as a
         stone, and cold as a cucumber. But then the Letter to Rousseau is like himself; and
         the Discourses on Elocution, and on the Liberty of Music, are divine. He has added
         to his translations from Tacitus; and (what is remarkable) though that Author's manner
         more nearly resembles the best French Writers of the present age, than any thing,
         he totally fails in the attempt. Is it his fault, or that of the language?
      </p>
      <p>I have received another Scotch packet with a third specimen, inferior in kind, (because
         it is merely description) but yet full of nature and noble wild imagination. Five
         Bards pass the night at the Castle of a Chief (himself a principal Bard); each goes
         out in his turn to observe the face of things, and returns with an extempore picture
         of the changes he has seen (it is an October night, the harvest-month of the Highlands).
         This is the whole plan; yet there is a contrivance, and a preparation of ideas, that
         you would not expect. The oddest thing is, that every one of them sees Ghosts (more
         or less). The idea, that struck and surprised me most, is the following. One of them
         (describing a storm of wind and rain) says 
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>Ghosts ride on the tempest to-night: <br /> Sweet is their voice between the gusts of wind; <br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Their songs are of other worlds!</span></p>
      </div>
      <p> Did you never observe (<span style="font-style:italic">while rocking winds are piping loud</span>) that pause, as the gust is recollecting itself, and rising upon the ear in a shrill
         and plaintive note, like the swell of an Ã†olian harp? I do assure you there is nothing
         in the world so like the voice of a spirit. Thomson had an ear sometimes: he was not
         deaf to this; and has described it gloriously, but given it another different turn,
         and of more horrour. I cannot repeat the lines: it is in his Winter. There is another
         very fine picture in one of them. It describes the breaking of the clouds after the
         storm, before it is settled into a calm, and when the moon is seen by short intervals.
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>The waves are tumbling on the lake, <br /> And lash the rocky sides. <br /> The boat is brim-full in the cove, <br /> The oars on the rocking tide. <br /> Sad sits a maid beneath a cliff, <br /> And eyes the rolling stream: <br /> Her Lover promised to come, <br /> She saw his boat (when it was evening) on the lake; <br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Are these his groans in the gale?</span> <br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Is this his broken boat on the shore?</span>
