      <p>Though you have had but a melancholy employment, it is worthy of envy, and (I hope)
         will have all the success it deserves.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> It was the best and most natural method of cure, and such as could not have been
         administered by any but your gentle hand. I thank you for communicating to me what
         must give you so much satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>I too was reading M. D'Alembert,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and (like you) am totally disappointed in his Elements.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I could only taste a little of the first course: it was dry as a stick, hard as a
         stone, and cold as a cucumber. But then the Letter to Rousseau<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is like himself; and the Discourses on Elocution,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and on the Liberty of Music,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are divine. He has added to his translations from Tacitus;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and (what is remarkable) though that Author's manner more nearly resembles the best
         French Writers of the present age, than any thing, he totally fails in the attempt.
         Is it his fault, or that of the language?
      </p>
      <p>I have received another Scotch packet<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with a third specimen,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> inferior in kind, (because it is merely description) but yet full of nature and noble
         wild imagination. Five Bards pass the night at the Castle of a Chief (himself a principal
         Bard); each goes out in his turn to observe the face of things, and returns with an
         extempore picture of the changes he has seen (it is an October night, the harvest-month
         of the Highlands). This is the whole plan; yet there is a contrivance, and a preparation
         of ideas, that you would not expect. The oddest thing is, that every one of them sees
         Ghosts (more or less). The idea, that struck and surprised me most, is the following.
         One of them (describing a storm of wind and rain) says 
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>Ghosts ride on the tempest to-night: <br /> Sweet is their voice between the gusts of wind; <br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Their songs are of other worlds!</span></p>
      </div>
      <p> Did you never observe (<span style="font-style:italic">while rocking winds are piping loud</span>)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that pause, as the gust is recollecting itself, and rising upon the ear in a shrill
         and plaintive note, like the swell of an Ã†olian harp? I do assure you there is nothing
         in the world so like the voice of a spirit. Thomson had an ear sometimes: he was not
         deaf to this; and has described it gloriously, but given it another different turn,
         and of more horrour. I cannot repeat the lines: it is in his Winter.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> There is another very fine picture in one of them. It describes the breaking of the
         clouds after the storm, before it is settled into a calm, and when the moon is seen
         by short intervals.
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>The waves are tumbling on the lake, <br /> And lash the rocky sides. <br /> The boat is brim-full in the cove, <br /> The oars on the rocking tide. <br /> Sad sits a maid beneath a cliff, <br /> And eyes the rolling stream: <br /> Her Lover promised to come, <br /> She saw his boat (when it was evening) on the lake; <br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Are these his groans in the gale?</span> <br /> <span style="font-style:italic">Is this his broken boat on the shore?</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
