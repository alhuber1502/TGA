            <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>It is always time to write, (whether Louisbourg be taken, or not) &amp; I am always alike glad to
					hear from you. I am glad however to repay you with the King of Prussia: there is a Man for you at a dead lift, that has beat &amp; baffled his three most powerful enemies, who had
					swallow'd him up in Idea! not that I look upon this last exploit, however seasonable, as his most
					heroick exploit; I suppose it was only butchering a great flock of slaves &amp; savages, a conquest, that, but for the necessity of it,
					he would have disdain'd. what use our little supply is like to be of in Germany I can not say; I only know, that my Ld Granby with his horse had a bridge, wch broke under them, &amp; that he (the Marquiss) was sore bruised, &amp; laid
					up: but I think the Electorate may be saved for all this.</p>
         <p>Old Pa: wrote to me from Scarborough three weeks ago. he had seen more in his journey than ever he
					saw before in his life, &amp; was to see twice as much more in his way to Glamis. he is become
					acquainted with rocks &amp; precipices, &amp; despises the tameness and insipidity of all we call fine in the South. Mr. Pitt, &amp; he, did not propose being at Glamis till the end of August: My Ld (I
					think) set out from Rainton on the 27th.</p>
         <p>If I had been at the great gambling dinner, I should have desired, somebody would help me to a collop of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> great Turtle, tho' I believe, 'tis vile meat. you tell me nothing about the good family at Ripton, that were to come together from all quarters &amp; be so happy this summer: has any ill chance hinder'd
					their meeting, or have you not paid them a visit this vacation? it is an infinite while, since I heard from M:n, I know no more of him
					than you do, but I hope Caractacus will profit of our losses. if pleasure or application take up his thoughts I am half content. </p>
         <p>My health I can not complain of, but as to my spirits they are always many degrees below changeable, &amp; I seem to myself to
					inspire every thing around me with ennuy &amp; dejection; but some time or other all these things must come to a conclusion, till which
					day I shall remain very sincerely </p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Yours </salute>
            <signed>TG: </signed>
         </closer>
         <postscript>
            <p>commend me to any, that enquire after me, particularly Mr Talbot.
