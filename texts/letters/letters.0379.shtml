         <div class="salute">Dear Mr Gray</div>
      </div>
      <p>I thank you much for your Criticisms But at present shall not take notice of them.
         They will stand me in good stead whenever I put the Elegy in my just<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> volume and till then let them pass.</p>
      <p>I thank you also very much for Your Georgiana. if they be genuine I thank you as an
         Englishman; and prefer them before evry thing that ever ended in Ana; but you are
         mistaken in your Preacher, it was Dr Thomas Wilson<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Westminster, who they say is a Rogue, the other is only a Coxcomb, but a sort
         of Coxcomb that I hate almost as much as a Rogue.</p>
      <p>If the nouvelle Eloise<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> be Rousseaus, pity me because I live at Aston, &amp; have not seen it, &amp; be sure send
         me some account of it and that with speed. I find there is a new report that Ld H<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is to go to Ireland this has inducd poor Fred: Hervey<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (glad of such an opportunity of renewing our Correspondence) to write to me, &amp; to
         tell me that His Friends have hopes of making him first Chaplain, but that he begs
         first to know whether it will interfere with me &amp; whether it might not be made compatible
         with my interest, all this was so Jellied over with Friendship that he thought I fancy
         I should scarce know the Dish he presented me with. The letter I shall tye up in a
         Bundle with one of Archbishop Huttons<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; some others wch I keep as Curiositys in their way, I have however in pity to his
         Wife &amp; family of small Children<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> sent him an answer not so tart as he deservd, &amp; given him full liberty of useing
         all his interest in this matter. However Keep this a Secret because I promisd to do
         it &amp; because also I should not have broke my promise could I have thought of any thing
         better to write at present.</p>
      <p>I am glad at Heart to find this annihilation of Toryism, wch you give me an acct of.
         Fobus, besides Lying, had only one other ministerial Art in his possession wch too
         was a Species of Lying, And this he exerted in making evry Man who was not a friend
         to the Ministry a Tory. Was he askd to explain this? he had not skill enough in English
         History &amp; the constitution of his country to do it; &amp; therefore he explaind himself
         by saying a Tory was a Jacobite, &amp; a Jacobite a Tory. Thus you may remember one of
         his tools who could not cleverly make you either Tory or Jacobite said you was worse
         you was a Republican.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> May God send this measure a happy ending, &amp; may the next Generation be only distinguishd
         by the style &amp; title of Friends to their Country.</p>
      <p>You have by this time heard Elisi<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> pray give me an account of him or it as soon as possible &amp; send me also your Recipe
         for Chevichi,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in plain terms.</p>
      <p>Have you made up your mind about Gothic Architecture &amp; consequently given over Your
         Genealogical Studies<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch it seems are so intimately connected with that Science. for my part I am metamorphosing
         some good Old Homilies into new-fashiond Sermons &amp; consequently spoiling every period
         of them. But what better can I do, living as I here do in almost absolute solitude,
         &amp; in that state of Life wch My old Friend Jeremy Taylor so well describes in his Sermon
         aptly entituled the Marriage ring.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> 'Celibate Life (sayth he) like the <span style="font-style:italic">Flie</span> in the <span style="font-style:italic">heart of an Apple dwells in a perpetual sweetness,</span> but sits alone, &amp; is confind, and <span style="font-style:italic">dies in singularity,</span> but Marriage like the useful Bee builds a house gathers sweetness from evry flowr
         labors and unites into Societys &amp; republics &amp;c.' If I survive You, &amp; come to publish
         your Works, I shall quote this passage, from whence you so evidently (without ever
         seeing it) took that thought <span style="font-style:italic">Poor Moralist, and what art thou,</span> &amp;c.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> But the Plagiarism had been too glaring had you taken <span style="font-style:italic">the heart of the Apple</span> In wch however the great beauty of the thought consists. After all why will you not
         read Jeremy Taylor? take my word once more for it he is the Shakespeare of Divines.</p>
