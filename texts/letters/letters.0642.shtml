      <p>I am glad to hear from Molly<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> today, that there is no particular charge against you in your office, for if it is
         only the greediness of the Corporation,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I will think it will be easily disappointed, the assurance Mr Shelvocke<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has given you, that you are secure weighs much with me: so much, that I doubt it
         was hardly necessary to speak to Ld Besborough<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on that head, for to petition before one is accused of any thing, may appear as if
         we were conscious of having done somewhat amiss: however my Letter is gone, &amp; can
         not be recalled, if it is unne[cessary]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> so much the better.</p>
      <p>I believe &amp; hope, you may continue ve[ry sure] on this head. let it only caution you
         to see the bus[iness] of your office diligently executed, &amp; to avoid even the least
         occasion of complaint, and then you have little to fear. </p>
