         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor</div>
      </div>
      <p>I am quite of Mr Alderman's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> opinion; provided you have a very fair prospect of success (for I do not love repulses,
         tho' I believe in such cases they are not attended with any disgrace) such an employment<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> must necessarily give countenance &amp; name to one in your profession, not to mention
         the use it must be of in refreshing &amp; keeping alive the Ideas of Practise you have
         already got, &amp; improving them by new observation. it can not but lead to other business
         too in a more natural way, than perhaps any other; for whatever lucky chance may have
         introduced into the world here &amp; there a Physician of great vogue, the same chance
         may hardly befall another in an age; &amp; the indirect &amp; by-ways, that doubtless have
         succeeded with many, are rather too dirty for you to tread. as to the time it would
         take up, so much the better. whenever it interferes with more advantageous practise,
         it is in your power to quit it. in the mean time it will prepare you for that trouble
         &amp; constant attendance, wch much business requires a much greater degree of. for you
         are not to dream of being your own Master, till Old-age &amp; a satiety of gain shall
         set you free. I tell you my notions of the matter, as I see it at a distance, wch
         you, who stand nearer, may rectify at your pleasure.</p>
      <p>I have continued the Soap every other day from the time I left you, except an interval
         or two of a week or ten days at a time, wch I allow'd in order to satisfy myself,
         whether the good effects of it were lasting, or only temporary. I think, I may say
         it has absolutely cured that complaint I used to mention to you, &amp; (what is more)
         the ill-habit, wch perhaps was the cause of that, &amp; of the flying pains I have every
         now &amp; then felt in my joints. whenever I use it, it much increases my appetite, &amp;
         the Heart-burn is quite vanish'd. so I may venture to say, it does good to my Stomach.
         when I shall speak of its bad effects, you are no longer to treat me as a whimsical
         body, for I am certain now, that it disorders the head, &amp; much disturbs one's sleep.
         this I now avoid by taking it immediately before dinner; &amp; besides these things are
         trifles compared with the good it has done me. in short I am so well, it would be
         folly to take any other medecine: therefore I reserve Lime-water for some more pressing
         occasion. I should be glad to know the particulars of Ld Northumb:d<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the Archbish:ps<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> illnesses, &amp; how far it has eased them in the Gout.</p>
      <p>I am glad you admire Machiavel, &amp; are entertained with Buffon,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; edified with the Divine Ashton.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the first (they say) was a good Man, as much as he has been abused; &amp; we will hope
         the best of the two latter. Mr. [Bedingfield],<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who (as [ ]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> sent me word) desired to be acquainted with me, call'd here (before I came down)
         &amp; would pay a visit to my rooms. he made Dr Long<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> conduct him thither, left me a present of a Book<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (not of his own writing) &amp; a Note with a very civil Compliment. I wrote to him<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to thank him, &amp; have received an answer, that fifteeen years ago might have turn'd
         my head. I know [ ]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> will abuse him to you, but I insist he is a Slanderer, &amp; shall write a Satire upon
         him, if he does not do Justice to my new Admirer. I have not added a line more to
         old Caradoc;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when I do, you will be sure to see it. you who give yourself the trouble to think
         of my health, will not think me very troublesome if I beg you to bespeak me a Rope-Ladder
         (for my Neighbours every day make a great progress in drunkenness, wch gives me reason
         to look about me) it must be full 36 Foot long, or a little more, but as light &amp; manageable
         as may be, easy to unroll, &amp; not likely to entangle. I never saw one, but I suppose
         it must have strong hooks, or something equivalent, a-top, to throw over an iron bar<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to be fix'd withinside of my window. however you will chuse the properest form, &amp;
         instruct me in the use of it. I see an Ephraim Hadden near Hermitage Stairs Wapping,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that advertises them, but perhaps you may find a better Artisan near you. this with
         a Canister of Tea &amp; another of Snuff, wch I left at your house, &amp; a Pound of Soap
         from Mr. Field<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (for mine is not so good here) will fill a Box, wch I beg the favour of you to send
         [me],<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when you can conveniently. my best Compliments to M[rs].<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Wharton.</p>
