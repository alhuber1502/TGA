   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>I write to make you write, for I have not much to tell you. I have recovered no spirits
         as yet; but, as I am not displeased with my company, I sit purring by the fire-side
         in my arm-chair with no small satisfaction. I read too sometimes, and have begun Tacitus,
         but have not yet read enough to judge of him; only his Pannonian sedition in the first
         book of his annals, which is just as far as I have got, seemed to me a little tedious.
         I have no more to say, but to desire you will write letters of a handsome length,
         and always answer me within a reasonable space of time, which I leave to your discretion.
