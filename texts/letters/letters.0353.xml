            <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I know not what to say to you after so long a silence, but that I have been down at Stoke to see poor Lady Cobham, &amp; after about
					three weeks pass'd there, she being obliged to come for advice (as they call it) to Town, I return'd with her, &amp; have been
					eversince, till about ten days ago, by her desire in the house with her in Hanover Square. she is
					dying (as it now plainly appears) of a Dropsy, &amp; the contemplation of ling'ring death is not apt to raise the spirits of any
					Spectator [ ]
				</p>
         <p>I have had an enquiry from Mr. Jonathan about painted glass, &amp; have given him such information,
					as I could procure. the manufacture at York seems to be the thing for your purpose, but the name of the Person I can not learn. he at Worcester sells it for two Shillings a pound (for
					it is sold by weight). I approve very well of the canopy-work border on the sides of each light descending to the bottom, provided it
					do not darken the window too much, &amp; take up so much of the 20 inches space, as to make the plain glass in the middle appear
					over-narrow. but I have been more used to see the whole top of colour'd glass (from where the Arch begins to turn) the gloom above
					contributing much to the beauty of the clear view below. I can not decide: the first is more Gothic &amp; more uncommon. the latter
					more convenient, &amp; more chearful. Green glass is not classical, nor ever seen in a real Church-window, but where there is History
					painted, &amp; there the Green is remarkably bad. I propose, the rich amethyst-purple instead of it. the mosaic pattern can hardly come
					amiss, only do not let too much yellow &amp; scarlet come together, if I could describe the Mosaïc at Mr. W:s it would be of no use to you, because it is not merely made of squares put together, but painted in a
					pattern by Price, &amp; shaded. it is as if little Balaustines, or Pomegranate-flowers, were set four
					together, &amp; formed a lozenge. these are of a golden yellow with a white Pearl at the junctions, &amp; the spaces inclosed by them
					are scarlet, or blew. this repeated makes a Diaper-work, &amp; fills the whole top of the window. I am sorry any of your designs depend
					upon Virginia; I fear it will fail you. St:r tells me, you have a
					neighbouring scene [superi]or to any banks of the Thames, where I am to live. [ ] lodge me? Mason has
					been in [ ] to Aston, where he [ ] tration are as [young] [ ] &amp; flourishing state of his country. [ ] clever, and forced from him by a nonsensical speech of
					Beckford's. the second was a studied &amp; puerilc declamation on funeral honours (on proposing a Monument for Wolf). in the course of it he wiped his eyes with one handkerchief, &amp; Beckford (who seconded him) cried too,
					&amp; wiped with two handkerchiefs at once, wch was very moving. the third was about Gen: Amhurst,
					&amp; in commendation of the industry &amp; ardour of our American Commanders, very spirited &amp; eloquent. this is a very critical
					time, an action being hourly expected between the two great Fleets, but no news as yet.</p>
         <p>I don't know where my Thermometer left off, but I do not find any observations till the 8th of
					Sept:r.</p>
