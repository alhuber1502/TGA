					       <dateline>Dec: 19. 1757. </dateline>
					       <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>Tho' I very well know the bland emollient saponaceous qualities both of Sack &amp; Silver, yet if
					any great Man would say to me, 'I make you <hi rend="italic">Rat-Catcher</hi> to his Majesty with a salary of 300Â£ a-year &amp; two
					Butts of the best Malaga; and tho' it has been usual to catch a mouse or two (for form's sake) in publick once a year, yet to You, Sr,
					we shall not stand upon these things'. I can not say, I should jump at it. nay, if they would drop the very name of the Office, &amp;
					call me <hi rend="italic">Sinecure</hi> to the Kg's majesty I should still feel a little awkward, &amp; think every body, I saw, smelt
					a Rat about me: but I do not pretend to blame any one else, that has not the same sensations. for my part I would rather be
					Serjeant-Trumpeter, or Pin-Maker to the Palace. nevertheless I interest myself a little in the History of it, &amp; rather wish
					somebody may accept it, that will retrieve the credit of the thing, if it be retrievable, or ever had
					any credit. Rowe was, I think, the last Man of character that had it. as to Settle, whom you mention, he belong'd to my Ld Mayor, not to the King. Eusden was a
					Person of great hopes in his youth, tho' at last he turned out a drunken Parson. Dryden was as
					disgraceful to the Office from his character, as the poorest Scribler could have been from his verses.
					[In sh]ort the office itself has always humbled the Pos[sess]or
					hitherto (even in an age, when Kings were somebody) if he were a poor Writer by making him more conspicuous, and if he were a good one,
					by setting him at war with the little fry of his own profession, for there are poets little enough to envy even a Poet-Laureat.</p>
				     <p>I am obliged to you for your news, pray send me some more, &amp; better of the sort. I can tell you nothing in return, so your
					generosity will be the greater. only Dick is going to give up his rooms, &amp; live at Ashwell. Mr Treasurer sets Sr M:w Lambe at naught,
					&amp; says, he has sent him reasons half a sheet at a time; &amp; Mr Brown attests his veracity, as an eye-witness. I have had nine
					pages of criticism on the Bard sent me in an anonymous letter, directed to the <hi rend="italic">Revd</hi> Mr G: at Strawberry-Hill,
					&amp; if I have a mind to hear as much more on the other Ode, I am told, where I may direct. he seems
					a good sensible Man, &amp; I dare say, a Clergyman. he is very frank, &amp; indeed much ruder, than he means to be.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu, Dear Mason, &amp; believe, that I am too. </salute>
