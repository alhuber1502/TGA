      <p>I am sorry I am forced to tell you, that I can not have the Satisfaction of seeing
         you now at Strawberry. here is a D<span class="super">r</span> Wharton (whose Name you remember) a particular Friend of mine, that I have not seen
         in several Years: his Errand hither has been chiefly to see me, &amp; till he leaves the
         Place, it will be impossible for me to stir.
      </p>
      <p>I wish your Invitation had been some Weeks later, but as it is, I must be content
         to lose that Pleasure, as I do most others, &amp; only send my Love to M<span class="super">r</span> Chute, &amp; Compliments to M<span class="super">r</span> Bentley.
