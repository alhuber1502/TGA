         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I want to know a hundred things about you. are you fix'd in your house, for I hear
         many vague reports of Miss A:s inclination to part with the estate, &amp; that the <span style="font-style:italic">Loves</span> are desirous of the purchase, &amp; would bid high? what part of the mansion (where I
         used to tremble at a breath of air) was blown down in the high wind? did not you bless
         your stars for that dreary flat, that lay between you &amp; Corton, &amp; bar'd all sight
         of the sea in its fury, &amp; of the numberless wrecks, that strew'd all your coast? as
         to our little &amp; unpicturesque events you know them, I find, &amp; have congratulated Mr
         Presendent, who is now our Master, in due form: but you do not know, that it never
         rains but it pours: he goes to Town on Monday for institution to the Living of Streatham
         in the Isle of Ely worth from two to three hundred pound a-year &amp; given him by the
         King's Majesty. the detail is infinite, the attacks, the defences, the evasions, the
         circumventions, the sacrifices, the perjuries, are only to be told by word of mouth:
         suffice it to say, that it is carried swimmingly &amp; triumphantly against two Lords
         temporal &amp; one spiritual, who sollicited for their several Protegés in vain: so our
         good Uncle Toby will have about 400£ a-year, no uncomfortable pittance! I have had
         several capricious letters from Berne. he has sent me some pretty views of his native
         country, &amp; its inhabitants. the portrait too is arrived done at Paris, but no more
         like <span style="font-style:italic">than I to Hercules:</span>  you would think, it was intended for his Father, so grave &amp; so composed: doubtless
         he meant to look, like an Englishman or an owl. pray send me the letter, &amp; do not
         suppose I grudge postage.
      </p>
      <p>I rejoice you have met with Froissart: he is the Herodotus of a barbarous age. had
         he but had the luck of writing in as good a language, he might have been immortal!
         his locomotive disposition (for then there was no other way of learning things) his
         simple curiosity, his religious credulity, were much like those of the old Grecian.
         our Ancestors used to read the Mort d'Arthur, Amadis de Gaul, &amp; Froissart, all alike,
         that is, they no more suspected the good faith of the former than they did of the
         latter, but took it all for history. when you have <span style="font-style:italic">tant chevauché</span>  as to get to the end of him, there is Monstrelet waits to take you up, &amp; will set
         you down at <span style="font-style:italic">Philip de Comines.</span>  but previous to all these you should have read <span style="font-style:italic">Villehardouin,</span>  &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">Joinville.</span>  I do not think myself bound to defend the character of even the best of Kings. pray
         slash them, &amp; spare not. my best compliments to Mrs Nicholls.
