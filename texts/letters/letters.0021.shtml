      <p>A thousand thanks for the thousand happy New-years you sent me, &amp; which, I suppose,

      <p>I need not wish anything further, since (as I wish, what you do) to be sure you know
         my wishes already: Wise folks say the wise mans happiness is in himself; pray, are
         you the wise man? they tell you too, that mortal happiness is not of long continuance;
         heaven send, yours may last, till you wish for a little misery; nay! and longer still:
         I can't tell whither our situations are much changed, since this time twelvemonth;
         certain I am however, that there is a great alteration: I don't succeed to your diversions
         in town, I believe, &amp; yet am absent from Cambridge without regret, nay with pleasure,
         tho' not infinitely happier here: â&#x80;&#x93;I have very little to tell you, as to the place,

         I went to King Arthur<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> last night, which is exceeding fine; they have a new man to [suppl]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>y Delane's place, one Johnson,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with ye finest person &amp; face in the world to all appearance; but as awkward, as a

         if all the Women run mad for him: the inchanted part of the play, is not Machinery,
         but actual magick: the second scene is a British temple enough to make one go back
         a thousand years, &amp; really be in ancient Britain: the Songs are all Church-musick,
         &amp; in every one of ye Chorus's Mrs Chambers<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> sung ye chief part, accompanied with</p>

         at first, by a Creature, yt was more like a Devil by half, than Grimbald<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> himself; she took herself for Madame la Confidente, but every body else took her
         to be in the Circumstances of Damnation: when Emmeline comes to her sight, she beholds

      <p>which set the people into such a laugh, as lasted the whole Act: the Frost Scene is
         excessive fine; the first Scene of it is only a Cascade, that seems frozen; with the
         Genius of Winter asleep &amp; wrapt in furs, who upon the approach of Cupid, after much
         quivering, &amp; shaking sings the finest song in the Play: just after, the Scene opens,
         &amp; shows a view of arched rocks coverd with Ice &amp; Snow to ye end of ye Stage; between
         the arches are upon pedestals of Snow eight Images of old men &amp; women, that seem frozen
         into Statues, with Icicles hanging about them &amp; almost hid in frost, &amp; from ye end
         come Singers, viz: Mrs Chambers, &amp;c: &amp; Dancers all rubbing their hands &amp; chattering
         with cold with fur gowns &amp; worsted gloves in abundance; there are several more beautiful
         Scenes; but rather than describe 'em, I ought to beg pardon for interrupting your
         happiness so long, and conclude myself </p>
