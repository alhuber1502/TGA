         <div class="dateline">Jan: 3–  London [           ]</div>
      </div>
      <p>A thousand thanks for the thousand happy New-years you sent me, &amp; which, I suppose,
         a thousand good-natured people have made you a present of, in the overflowings of
         their zeal:
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>– May each revolving year <br /> With blessings crown'd, like this, returning smile <br /> On [     ], the happiest of his Kind–
         </p>
      </div>
      <p>I need not wish anything further, since (as I wish, what you do) to be sure you know
         my wishes already: Wise folks say the wise mans happiness is in himself; pray, are
         you the wise man? they tell you too, that mortal happiness is not of long continuance;
         heaven send, yours may last, till you wish for a little misery; nay! and longer still:
         I can't tell whither our situations are much changed, since this time twelvemonth;
         certain I am however, that there is a great alteration: I don't succeed to your diversions
         in town, I believe, &amp; yet am absent from Cambridge without regret, nay with pleasure,
         tho' not infinitely happier here: –I have very little to tell you, as to the place,
         call'd London:– Adriano expired a few days ago, &amp; his auncient Predecessour Artaxerxes
         succeeds him for the present, w<span class="super">ch</span> I think to visit to night: the [Town (in submissio]n to your judgement) don't much
         admire Delane; Mrs Porter acts in ye Albion Queens, but I shall stay for another Play,
         before I see her; neither have I much inclination for old Cibber in Sr Courtly Nice,
         nor for young Mrs Cibber in Voltaire's Zara, in w<span class="super">ch</span> she performs the principal part for ye first time of her appearance in that way:
         I went to King Arthur last night, which is exceeding fine; they have a new man to
         [suppl]y Delane's place, one Johnson, with ye finest person &amp; face in the world to
         all appearance; but as awkward, as a Button-maker; in short, if he knew how to manage
         his Beauties to advantage, I should not wonder, if all the Women run mad for him:
         the inchanted part of the play, is not Machinery, but actual magick: the second scene
         is a British temple enough to make one go back a thousand years, &amp; really be in ancient
         Britain: the Songs are all Church-musick, &amp; in every one of ye Chorus's Mrs Chambers
         sung ye chief part, accompanied with
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>Roarings, Squawlings &amp; Squeakations dire</p>
      </div>
      <p>Mrs Giffard is by way of Emmeline, &amp; should be blind, but, heaven knows! I would not
         wish to see better than she does, &amp; seems to do; for when Philidel restores her to
         sight, her eyes are not at all better than before; she is led in at first, by a Creature,
         yt was more like a Devil by half, than Grimbald himself; she took herself for Madame
         la Confidente, but every body else took her to be in the Circumstances of Damnation:
         when Emmeline comes to her sight, she beholds this Mrs Matilda first, &amp; cries out
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>Are Women all like thee? such glorious Creatures!</p>
      </div>
      <p>which set the people into such a laugh, as lasted the whole Act: the Frost Scene is
         excessive fine; the first Scene of it is only a Cascade, that seems frozen; with the
         Genius of Winter asleep &amp; wrapt in furs, who upon the approach of Cupid, after much
         quivering, &amp; shaking sings the finest song in the Play: just after, the Scene opens,
         &amp; shows a view of arched rocks coverd with Ice &amp; Snow to ye end of ye Stage; between
         the arches are upon pedestals of Snow eight Images of old men &amp; women, that seem frozen
         into Statues, with Icicles hanging about them &amp; almost hid in frost, &amp; from ye end
         come Singers, viz: Mrs Chambers, &amp;c: &amp; Dancers all rubbing their hands &amp; chattering
         with cold with fur gowns &amp; worsted gloves in abundance; there are several more beautiful
         Scenes; but rather than describe 'em, I ought to beg pardon for interrupting your
         happiness so long, and conclude myself
