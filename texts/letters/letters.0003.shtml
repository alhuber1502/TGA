      <p>This comes to let you know, that I am in good health; but that I should not have been
         so, if it had not been for your kind promise of coming to tend me yourself, &amp; see
         the effect of your own Prescription: and I should desire of you, so please you, as
         how that, you would be so good as to be so kind, as to do me the favour of bringing
         down with you a quantity of it, prepared as your Grandmothers Aunt, poor Mrs Hawthorn
         (God<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> rest her soul, for she was as well a natured, a good Gentlewoman, as ever broke bread,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or trod upon Shoe-leather;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> though I say it, that should not say it; for you know, she was related to me, &amp; marry!
         not a jot the worse, I trow) used to make it: now I would not put you to this trouble,
         if I could provide myself of the Ingredients here; but truly, when I went to the Poticaries
         for a drachm of Spirit of Ridicule; the saucy Jackanapes of a Prentice-Boy fleered
         at me, I warrant ye, as who should say, you don't know your Errand: so by my troth,
         away ambles me I (like a fool as I came) home again, &amp; when I came to look of your
         Receipt; to be sure, there was Spt of RIDICULE in great Letters, as plain as the nose
         in one's face: &amp; so, back hurries I in a making-Water-while, as one may say,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; when I came there, says I; you stripling, up-start, worsted-stocking, white-liver'd,

         pocky, rascally, damned Son of a Bitch, says I–for you know, when he put me in such
         a perilous Passion, how could one help telling him his own–why, 'twould have provoked

         <p>If I should undertake to prove to you, that everything is Tobacco, it might be looked
            upon as an Absurdity after the revrd &amp; learnd Dn Swift has made it so manifest, that
            every thing is a Pudding:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but I conceive it will not be so difficult to shew, that Tobacco is every thing (at
            least here) for there is not a soul in our Colledge (a body I should say) who does
            not smoke or chew: there's nothing but Whiffing from Fellow to Sizer; nay, even the
            very Chimnies, that they may'nt be thought partic'lar, must needs smoke, like the
            rest: whilst unfashionable I labour thro' clouds of it, with as much pains, as Milton's
            poor Devil took, when he travel'd through Chaos:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>–but, as to the Guzzling affair, you mistook in thinking it was the Old fellows, that
            were with me; no 'twas a thousand times worse; they were all young ones–do but imagine
            me pent up in a room hired for the purpose, &amp; none of the largest, from 7 a-clock
            at night, till 4 in the morning! 'midst hogsheads of Liquor &amp; quantities of Tobacco,
            surrounded by 30 of these creatures, infinitely below the meanest People you could
            even form an Idea off; toasting bawdy healths &amp; deafned with their unmeaning Roar;
            Jesus!<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but I must tell you of a fat Mortal, who stuck close to me, &amp; was as drunk (as Miss
            Edwards<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>–which story I'm afraid by the by, was too well-fancied, to be real) well! he was
            so maudlin &amp; so loving &amp; told me long Stories, interrupted by the sourest Interjections,
            with moral Discourses upon God knows what! that I was almost drunk too: oh–I must
            just beg lea[ve to men]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>tion one more, who, they tell me, has no fault, but that, he's a little too <span style="font-style:italic">foppish</span> &amp; talks like a London-Rake; this fine Gentleman is quite master of the Spectator
            &amp; retails it for ever; among the rest, he gave his humble Opinion of the present state
            of the Play-house; that Stevens<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> had a very graceful Motion, spoke well, &amp;c, but that he must needs give his Voice
            for Mr Quin;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mrs Thurmond<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> too was in great favour with him: as for the Opera's he could not understand them,
            but had heard Margaretta<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Nicolini<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> highly commended by those, that were judges: by God, says another, those Opera's
            are the ruin of the nation; no honest people can go to 'em, &amp; those, that do, are
            ashamed of themselves; else why should they go in Masques &amp; Disguises thither–no body
            in the company found out his blunder, so no body laugh'd but I, which was taken for
            applause. you'll think it a strange compliment, when I tell you how often I thought
            of you, all the while: but will forgive me, when you recollect, that 'twas a great
            piece of Philosophy in me, to be able, in ye midst of Noise &amp; Disturbance, to call
            to mind the most agreeable thing in nature: when you could give me so much Pleasure,
            absent; what must you do, when with me? tho' perhaps its policy in you to stay away
            so long, that you may increase my Desire of seeing you: in your next send me word,
            how soon you design, to come to the relief</p>
