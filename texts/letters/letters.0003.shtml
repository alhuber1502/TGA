      <p>This comes to let you know, that I am in good health; but that I should not have been
         so, if it had not been for your kind promise of coming to tend me yourself, &amp; see
         the effect of your own Prescription: and I should desire of you, so please you, as
         how that, you would be so good as to be so kind, as to do me the favour of bringing
         down with you a quantity of it, prepared as your Grandmothers Aunt, poor Mrs Hawthorn
         (God rest her soul, for she was as well a natured, a good Gentlewoman, as ever broke
         bread, or trod upon Shoe-leather; though I say it, that should not say it; for you
         know, she was related to me, &amp; marry! not a jot the worse, I trow) used to make it:
         now I would not put you to this trouble, if I could provide myself of the Ingredients
         here; but truly, when I went to the Poticaries for a drachm of Spirit of Ridicule;
         the saucy Jackanapes of a Prentice-Boy fleered at me, I warrant ye, as who should
         say, you don't know your Errand: so by my troth, away ambles me I (like a fool as
         I came) home again, &amp; when I came to look of your Receipt; to be sure, there was Spt
         of RIDICULE in great Letters, as plain as the nose in one's face: &amp; so, back hurries
         I in a making-Water-while, as one may say, &amp; when I came there, says I; you stripling,
         up-start, worsted-stocking, white-liver'd, lath-backed, impudent Princox, says I;
         abuse me! that am your betters every day in the week, says I; you ill-begotten, pocky,
         rascally, damned Son of a Bitch, says I–for you know, when he put me in such a perilous
         Passion, how could one help telling him his own–why, 'twould have provoked any Christian
         in the world, tho' twere a Dog–to speak; &amp; so if you'll be so kind, I'll take care
         you shall be satisfied for your trouble: so, this is all at present from
      </p>

         <p>If I should undertake to prove to you, that everything is Tobacco, it might be looked
            upon as an Absurdity after the revrd &amp; learnd Dn Swift has made it so manifest, that
            every thing is a Pudding: but I conceive it will not be so difficult to shew, that
            Tobacco is every thing (at least here) for there is not a soul in our Colledge (a
            body I should say) who does not smoke or chew: there's nothing but Whiffing from Fellow
            to Sizer; nay, even the very Chimnies, that they may'nt be thought partic'lar, must
            needs smoke, like the rest: whilst unfashionable I labour thro' clouds of it, with
            as much pains, as Milton's poor Devil took, when he travel'd through Chaos:–but, as
            to the Guzzling affair, you mistook in thinking it was the Old fellows, that were
            with me; no 'twas a thousand times worse; they were all young ones–do but imagine
            me pent up in a room hired for the purpose, &amp; none of the largest, from 7 a-clock
            at night, till 4 in the morning! 'midst hogsheads of Liquor &amp; quantities of Tobacco,
            surrounded by 30 of these creatures, infinitely below the meanest People you could
            even form an Idea off; toasting bawdy healths &amp; deafned with their unmeaning Roar;
            Jesus! but I must tell you of a fat Mortal, who stuck close to me, &amp; was as drunk
            (as Miss Edwards–which story I'm afraid by the by, was too well-fancied, to be real)
            well! he was so maudlin &amp; so loving &amp; told me long Stories, interrupted by the sourest
            Interjections, with moral Discourses upon God knows what! that I was almost drunk
            too: oh–I must just beg lea[ve to men]tion one more, who, they tell me, has no fault,
            but that, he's a little too <span style="font-style:italic">foppish</span> &amp; talks like a London-Rake; this fine Gentleman is quite master of the Spectator
            &amp; retails it for ever; among the rest, he gave his humble Opinion of the present state
            of the Play-house; that Stevens had a very graceful Motion, spoke well, &amp;c, but that
            he must needs give his Voice for Mr Quin; Mrs Thurmond too was in great favour with
            him: as for the Opera's he could not understand them, but had heard Margaretta &amp; Nicolini
            highly commended by those, that were judges: by God, says another, those Opera's are
            the ruin of the nation; no honest people can go to 'em, &amp; those, that do, are ashamed
            of themselves; else why should they go in Masques &amp; Disguises thither–no body in the
            company found out his blunder, so no body laugh'd but I, which was taken for applause.
            you'll think it a strange compliment, when I tell you how often I thought of you,
            all the while: but will forgive me, when you recollect, that 'twas a great piece of
            Philosophy in me, to be able, in ye midst of Noise &amp; Disturbance, to call to mind
            the most agreeable thing in nature: when you could give me so much Pleasure, absent;
            what must you do, when with me? tho' perhaps its policy in you to stay away so long,
            that you may increase my Desire of seeing you: in your next send me word, how soon
            you design, to come to the relief
