					       <salute> Dear Sir </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p> I troubled you some time ago, by M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason, with a petition on behalf of M<hi rend="super">r</hi> T.
						Warton, who is digesting his history of E. Poetry, and wishes very much to know what your idea was
					for the scheme of such a work. I told him, I did not know what progress you had made in that design,
					or whether you had drawn out a plan of it, but that, if you had, I believed you would readily acquaint him with it. This passed in the
					Summer, &amp; since that I have heard nothing of him. But as I suppose you are now in college, after your various wanderings by sea and
					land, you will give me a pleasure to let me know what I shall further say on this subject to M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Warton. If you
					have any papers to communicate to him, &amp; will send them to me, I will take care they shall be transmitted safely to Oxford. I
					believe I may answer to you for him, that he will make no improper use of your favours.</p>
				     <p> Of M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason I hear nothing, except, by D<hi rend="super">r</hi> Gisburne,
					that he is now at Aston. He complains, that you and I are hyper-critical, or rather hyper-political: But in this he is mistaken: We
					only wish to see his Georgic, truly Virgilian.</p>
				     <p> M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Nevile has sent me his <hi>Imitations</hi>. They are not to be
					considered, as <hi>Satires</hi>, for popular reading; but as <hi>classical amusements</hi>, sometimes copying the sense, &amp;
					sometimes the manner, of his originals. And in this light, they have frequently great merit.</p>
				     <p> You did not send me a copy of the Installation Ode; which piqued me, so much, that I was greatly disappointed when, with so good a
					disposition to find fault, I was obliged, with all the world, to commend &amp; admire it</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute> I am very truly, Dear Sir, <lb/> Your affectionate humble Servant </salute>
