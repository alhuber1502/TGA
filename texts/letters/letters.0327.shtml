      <p>I have asked no body's advice: but I conclude, as poor M<span class="super">rs</span> P: died after your Aunt, her legacy must belong to her, &amp; consequently to her husband;
         &amp; this, (as I told you, &amp; still wonder at it) is also the opinion of M<span class="super">rs</span> O: for once: she is pure &amp; hearty again, God bless her old soul. Bob returns home
         tomorrow, but without any letter of attorney. I know (but this is a <span class="hi">violent secret</span>) she had made her will before he came. You will think consequently, that you are
         cut short; but be easy, &amp; hold your tongue: it is not so.
