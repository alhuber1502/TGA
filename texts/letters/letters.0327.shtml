      <p>I have asked no body's advice: but I conclude, as poor M<span class="super">rs</span> P:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> died after your Aunt,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> her legacy must belong to her, &amp; consequently to her husband;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; this, (as I told you, &amp; still wonder at it) is also the opinion of M<span class="super">rs</span> O:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for once: she is pure &amp; hearty again, God bless her old soul. Bob<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> returns home tomorrow, but without any letter of attorney. I know (but this is a
         <span class="hi">violent secret</span>) she had made her will<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> before he came. You will think consequently, that you are cut short; but be easy,
         &amp; hold your tongue: it is not so.</p>
