            <salute>Dear Sir, </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>You will not imagine me the less grateful for the long letter you were so good to write me some time since, because I have omitted to
					answer it, especially if you know what has since happened. Mrs. Rogers died in the end of September; and what with going to town to
					prove her will and other necessary things, what with returning back hither to pay debts, make inventories, and other such delightful amusements, I have really been almost wholly taken
					up. I might perhaps make a merit even of writing now, if you could form a just idea of my situation, being joint executor with another
						aunt, who is of a mixed breed between â€” and the Dragon of Wantley. So much for her. I next proceed to tell you that I saw Mason in town, who stayed there a day on my account,
					and then set out (not in a huff) with a laudable resolution to pass his winter at Aston, and save a curate. My Lord has said something to him, which I am glad of, that looked like an
					excuse for his own dilatoriness in preferring him; but this is a secret. He told me he had seen you, and that you were well. Dr.
					Wharton continues dispirited, but a little better than he was. The first act of Caractacus is just arrived here, but I have not read it
					over.</p>
         <p>I am very disagreeable; but who can help that?</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu, my best Mr. Brown; I am ever yours, </salute>
            <signed>T. G. </signed>
         </closer>
         <postscript>
            <p>I shall hardly be at Cambridge before Christmas. I recollect that it is very possible you may have
						paid my bills; if so, pray inform me what they amount to, that I may send the money when I get to
						London, or sooner, if you please.</p>
