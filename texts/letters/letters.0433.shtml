      <p>Having been upon the ramble, I have neglected all my duties, in hopes of finding pleasures
         in their room; which, after all (as you know well), one never finds. My conscience
         reproaches me with your obliging letter; and would (I really think) carry me into
         Somersetshire, did not poverty and winter stare me in the face, and bid me sit still.
         I well remember Dr. Ross's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> kind invitation, and in better days still hope to accept it. Doubt not but my inclinations
         will be quickened by the hopes I entertain of seeing you in so many new lights; the
         travelled Mr. Robinson, with a thousand important airs and graces, so much <span style="font-style:italic">virtÃ¹,</span> so much <span style="font-style:italic">scavoir-vivre!</span> the husband, the father, the rich clergyman, warm, snug, and contented as a bishop.
         My mouth waters: but sure â&#x80;&#x93; the family will be in town this winter, and I shall
         see you there in November. Is this the fine autumn you promised me? Oh! I hear you
         (not curse: you must not, but) ... this untoward climate. I doubt not but you write
         to Mason, though he does not tell me so. There is he, repining at his four-and-twenty
         weeks residence at York, unable to visit his bowers, the work of his own hands, at
         Aston, except in the depth of winter; and longing for the fleshpots and coffee-houses
         of Cambridge. There is nobody contented but you and I â&#x80;&#x93; oh yes, and Dr. Ross; who
         (I shrewdly suspect) is the happiest of the three.</p>

         <div class="salute">Adieu, dear Sir, and believe me sincerely<br /> Your friend and humble servant,</div>

      <div class="postscript">
         <p>Present my compliments to Mrs. Robinson. Some time or other I hope to have the honour
            of being better known to her. Mr. Brown is well, and much obliged to you for your
            kind remembrance of him. </p>
