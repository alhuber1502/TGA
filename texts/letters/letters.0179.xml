					       <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p> You have indeed conducted with great decency my little <hi rend="italic">misfortune</hi>: you have taken a paternal care of it, and
					expressed much more kindness than could have been expected from so near a relation. But we are all frail; and I hope to do as much for
					you another time. Nurse Dodsley has given it a pinch or two in the cradle, that (I doubt) it will bear the marks of as long as it
					lives. But no matter: we have ourselves suffered under her hands before now; and besides, it will
					only look the more careless, and by <hi rend="italic">accident</hi>
					 as it were. I thank you for your advertisement, which saves my honour, and in a manner <hi rend="italic">bien flatteuse pour moi,</hi> who should be put to it even to make myself a compliment in good English.</p>
				     <p>You will take me for a mere poet, and a fetcher and carrier of singsong, if I tell you that I
					intend to send you the beginning of a drama, not mine, thank God, as you'll believe, when you hear it
					is finished, but wrote by a person whom I have a very good opinion of. It is (unfortunately) in the manner of the ancient drama, with
					choruses, which I am, to my shame, the occasion of; for, as great part of it was at first written in that form, I would not suffer him
					to change it to a play fit for the stage, as he intended, because the lyric parts are the best of it, and they must have been lost. The
					story is Saxon, and the language has a tang of Shakespeare, that suits an old-fashioned fable very well. In short, I don't do it merely
					to amuse you, but for the sake of the author, who wants a judge, and so I would lend him <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>: yet not without
					your leave, lest you should have us up to dirty our stockings at the bar of your house for wasting the time and politics of the <hi rend="italic">nation.</hi>
         </p>
