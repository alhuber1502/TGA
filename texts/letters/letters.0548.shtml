         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>Here am I once again, &amp; have sold my estate, &amp; got a thousand guineas, &amp; fourscore
         pound a year for my old Aunt, &amp; a 20Â£ prize in the lottery, &amp; Lord knows what arrears
         in the Treasury, &amp; am a rich Fellow enough, go to; &amp; a Fellow, that hath had losses,
         &amp; one, that hath two gowns, &amp; every thing handsome about him! &amp; in a few days I shall
         have curtains, are you avised of that; ay, &amp; a matterass to lie upon.
      </p>
      <p>And there's Dr Hallifax tells me, there are three or four fellow-commoners got into
         the lodge. but they will be out in a week's time, &amp; all ready for Mrs Nicholls's reception
         &amp; yours. so do your pleasures, I invite nobody. and there's Dr Thomas may be Bp of
         Carlisle, if he pleases; &amp; (if not) Dr. Powell: &amp; in the first case Dr Ross will be
         Dean of Ely and so I am
