      <p>And so you have a garden of your own, &amp; you plant &amp; transplant &amp; are dirty &amp; amused!
         are not you ashamed of yourself? why, I have no so such thing, you monster; nor ever
         shall be either dirty or amused as long as I live! my gardens are in the window,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> like those of a Lodger up three pair of stairs in Petticoat-lane<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or Camomile-street,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; they go to bed regularly under the same roof that I do. dear, how charming it must
         be to walk out in one's own garding, &amp; sit on a bench in the open air with a fountain,
         &amp; a leaden statue, &amp; a rolling stone,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; an arbour! have a care of sore-throats tho', &amp; the <span style="font-style:italic">agoe.</span></p>

         see it torn piece-meal in the North-Briton, before it is born. the musick is as good
         as the words: the former might be taken for mine, &amp; the latter for Dr. Randal's.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if you will come, you shall see it &amp; sing in it with Mr Norris,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Mr Clerke,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Clergyman, and Mr Reinholt,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Miss Thomas,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> great names at Salisbury &amp; Gloster musick-meeting, and well-versed in Judas-Maccab√¶us.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Dr Marriott is to have Ld Sandwich<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the Attorney-General<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at his Lodge, not to mention foreign Ministers, who are to lie with Dr Hallifax,
         or in the stables. Ld North<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is at King's, Ld Weymouth<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Mrs Arbuthnot's, they talk of the D: of Bedford, who (I suppose), has a bed in
         King's-Chappel. the Archbishop<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is to be at Christ's, Bps of London<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Clare-Hall, of Lincoln<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Dr Gordon's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Chester<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Peter-House, of Norwich<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Jesus, of St David's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Caius, of Bangor,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at the Dog &amp; Porridge-pot, Marq: of Granby<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Woodyer's.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Yorkes &amp; Townshends will not come. Soulsby the Taylor lets his room for 11 guineas
         the 3 days, Woodyer aforesaid for 15. Brotherton asks 20. I have a bed over the way
         offer'd me at 3 half-crowns a night, but it may be gone, before you come. I believe,
         all that are unlett will be cheap, as the time approaches. I wish it were once over,
         &amp; immediately I go for a few days to London, &amp; so (with Mr Brown) to Aston, tho' I
         fear it will rain the whole summer, &amp; Skiddaw will be invisible &amp; inaccessible to
         mortals. I forgot to tell you, that on the Monday (after his Grace has breakfasted
         on a Divinity-act) twelve Noblemen &amp; Fellow-commoners are to settle his stomach with
         verses made &amp; repeated by themselves. Saturday next<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (you know) is the great day, &amp; he goes away on Monday after this repast.</p>
      <p>I have got <span style="font-style:italic">De la Lande's</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Voyage thro' Italy in 8 vol:s. he is a Member of the Acad: of Sciences, &amp; pretty
         good to read. I have read an 8vo volume of Shenstone's letters.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> poor Man! he was always wishing for money, for fame, &amp; other distinctions, &amp; his
         whole philosophy consisted in living against his will in retirement, &amp; in a place,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch his taste had adorn'd; but wch he only enjoy'd, when People of note came to see
         &amp; commend it. his correspondence is about nothing else but this place &amp; his own writings
         with two or three neighbouring Clergymen, who wrote verses too.</p>
      <p>I will send the Wilton-book<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> directed to Payne for you, tho' I know it will be lost, &amp; then you will say, it was
         not worth above a shilling, wch is a great comfort to me. I have just found the beginning
         of a letter, wch somebody had drop'd: I should rather call it first thoughts for the
         beginning of a letter, for there are many scratches &amp; corrections. as I can not use
         it myself (having got a beginning already of my own) I send it for your use upon some
         great occasion.</p>
