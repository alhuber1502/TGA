      <p>And so you have a garden of your own, &amp; you plant &amp; transplant &amp; are dirty &amp; amused!
         are not you ashamed of yourself? why, I have no so such thing, you monster; nor ever
         shall be either dirty or amused as long as I live! my gardens are in the window, like
         those of a Lodger up three pair of stairs in Petticoat-lane or Camomile-street, &amp;
         they go to bed regularly under the same roof that I do. dear, how charming it must
         be to walk out in one's own garding, &amp; sit on a bench in the open air with a fountain,
         &amp; a leaden statue, &amp; a rolling stone, &amp; an arbour! have a care of sore-throats tho',
         &amp; the <span style="font-style:italic">agoe.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Odicle</span>  has been rehearsed again &amp; again, &amp; the boys have got scraps by heart: I expect
         to see it torn piece-meal in the North-Briton, before it is born. the musick is as
         good as the words: the former might be taken for mine, &amp; the latter for Dr. Randal's.
         if you will come, you shall see it &amp; sing in it with Mr Norris, &amp; Mr Clerke, the Clergyman,
         and Mr Reinholt, &amp; Miss Thomas, great names at Salisbury &amp; Gloster musick-meeting,
         and well-versed in Judas-Maccab√¶us. Dr Marriott is to have Ld Sandwich &amp; the Attorney-General
         at his Lodge, not to mention foreign Ministers, who are to lie with Dr Hallifax, or
         in the stables. Ld North is at King's, Ld Weymouth at Mrs Arbuthnot's, they talk of
         the D: of Bedford, who (I suppose), has a bed in King's-Chappel. the Archbishop is
         to be at Christ's, Bps of London at Clare-Hall, of Lincoln at Dr Gordon's, of Chester
         at Peter-House, of Norwich at Jesus, of St David's at Caius, of Bangor, at the Dog
         &amp; Porridge-pot, Marq: of Granby at Woodyer's. the Yorkes &amp; Townshends will not come.
         Soulsby the Taylor lets his room for 11 guineas the 3 days, Woodyer aforesaid for
         15. Brotherton asks 20. I have a bed over the way offer'd me at 3 half-crowns a night,
         but it may be gone, before you come. I believe, all that are unlett will be cheap,
         as the time approaches. I wish it were once over, &amp; immediately I go for a few days
         to London, &amp; so (with Mr Brown) to Aston, tho' I fear it will rain the whole summer,
         &amp; Skiddaw will be invisible &amp; inaccessible to mortals. I forgot to tell you, that
         on the Monday (after his Grace has breakfasted on a Divinity-act) twelve Noblemen
         &amp; Fellow-commoners are to settle his stomach with verses made &amp; repeated by themselves.
         Saturday next (you know) is the great day, &amp; he goes away on Monday after this repast.
      </p>
      <p>I have got <span style="font-style:italic">De la Lande's</span>  Voyage thro' Italy in 8 vol:s. he is a Member of the Acad: of Sciences, &amp; pretty
         good to read. I have read an 8vo volume of Shenstone's letters. poor Man! he was always
         wishing for money, for fame, &amp; other distinctions, &amp; his whole philosophy consisted
         in living against his will in retirement, &amp; in a place, wch his taste had adorn'd;
         but wch he only enjoy'd, when People of note came to see &amp; commend it. his correspondence
         is about nothing else but this place &amp; his own writings with two or three neighbouring
         Clergymen, who wrote verses too.
      </p>
      <p>I will send the Wilton-book directed to Payne for you, tho' I know it will be lost,
         &amp; then you will say, it was not worth above a shilling, wch is a great comfort to
         me. I have just found the beginning of a letter, wch somebody had drop'd: I should
         rather call it first thoughts for the beginning of a letter, for there are many scratches
         &amp; corrections. as I can not use it myself (having got a beginning already of my own)
         I send it for your use upon some great occasion.

         <p>After so long silence the hopes of pardon &amp; prospect of forgiveness might seem entirely

            insufficient to counterballance it, or alleviate my fault. how then shall my deficiency
