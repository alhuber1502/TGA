         <p>Sure You are not out of your Wits! this I know, if you suffer my Head to be printed, you infallibly
					will put me out of mine. I conjure you immediately to put a stop to any such design. who is at the Expence of engraving it, I know not;
					but if it be Dodsley, I will make up the Loss to him. the thing, as it was, I know will make me ridiculous enough; but to appear in
					proper Person at the head of my works, consisting of half a dozen Ballads in 30 Pages, would be worse than the Pillory. I do assure
					you, if I had received such a Book with such a frontispice without any warning, I believe, it would have given me a Palsy. therefore I
					rejoice to have received this Notice; &amp; shall not be easy, till you tell me all thoughts of it are laid aside. I am extremely in
					earnest, &amp; can't bear even the Idea!</p>
         <p>I had wrote to Dodsley to tell him, how little I liked the Title he had prefix'd, but your letter has put all that out of my Head. if
					you think it necessary to print these Explanations for the use of People that have no eyes, I could
					be glad, they were a little alter'd. I am to my shame in your debt for a long letter, but I can not think of anything else, till you
					have set me at ease.</p>
