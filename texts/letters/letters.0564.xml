            <p>Wd at N:W. clouds &amp; sunshine. a mile &amp; Â½ from Brough on a hill lay a great army
							encamp'd. to the left open'd a fine valley with green meadows &amp; hedge-rows, a Gentleman's house
						peeping forth from a grove of old trees. on a nearer approach appear'd myriads of horses &amp; cattle in the road itself &amp; in all
						the fields round me, a brisk stream hurrying cross the way, thousands of clean healthy People in their best party-color'd apparel,
						Farmers &amp; their families, Esquires &amp; their daughters, hastening up from the dales &amp; down the fells on every side,
						glittering in the sun &amp; pressing forward to join the throng: while the dark hills, on many of whose tops the mists were yet
						hanging, served as a contrast to this gay &amp; moving scene, wch continued for near two miles more along the road, and the crowd
						(coming towards it) reach'd on as far as Appleby. </p>
            <p>On the ascent of the hill above Appleby the thick hanging wood &amp; the long reaches of the Eden (rapid, clear, &amp; full as ever)
						winding below with views of the Castle &amp; Town gave much employment to the mirror: but the sun was
						wanting &amp; the sky overcast. oats &amp; barley cut every where, but not carried in. passed Kirby-thore, Sr W: Dalston's house at Acorn bank, Whinfield-park, Harthorn-oaks, Countess-pillar, Brougham-Castle, Mr Brown (one of ye
						six Clerks) his large new house, cross'd the Eden &amp; the Eimot
						(pronounce <hi rend="italic">Eeman</hi>) with its green vale, &amp; at 3 o'clock dined with Mrs Buchanan, at <hi rend="italic">Penrith</hi> on trout &amp; partridge. in the afternoon walk'd up the <hi rend="italic">Beacon-hill</hi> a mile to the top, saw
						Whinfield and Lowther-parks, &amp; thro' an opening in the bosom of that cluster of mountains, wch the Doctor well remembers, the Lake
						of Ulz-water, with the craggy tops of a hundred nameless hills. these to W: &amp; S:, to the N: a great extent of black &amp; dreary
						plains, to E: <hi rend="italic">Cross-fell</hi> just visible thro' mists &amp; vapours hovering round it.</p>
            <p>Oct: 1. Wd at S:W: a grey autumnal day, air perfectly calm &amp; gentle. went to see <hi rend="italic">Ulz-water</hi> 5 miles
						distant. soon left the Keswick-road &amp; turn'd to the left thro' shady lanes along the Vale of <hi rend="italic">Eeman,</hi> wch
						runs rapidly on near the way, ripling over the stones. to the right is <hi rend="italic">Delmaine,</hi> a large fabrick of pale red
						stone with 9 windows in front &amp; 7 on the side built by Mr Hassel, behind it a fine lawn
						surrounded by woods &amp; a long rocky eminence rising over them. a clear &amp; brisk rivulet runs by the house to join the Eeman,
						whose course is in sight &amp; at a small distance.</p>
            <p>Farther on appears <hi rend="italic">Hatton St John,</hi>
						 a castle-like old mansion of Mr Huddleston. approach'd <hi rend="italic">Dunmallert,</hi> a fine
						pointed hill, cover'd with wood planted by old Mr Hassle beforemention'd, who lives always at home &amp; delights in planting. walk'd
						over a spungy meadow or two &amp; began to mount this hill thro' a broad &amp; strait green alley among the trees, &amp; with some
						toil gain'd the summit. from hence saw the Lake opening directly at my feet majestic in its calmness, clear &amp; smooth as a blew
						mirror with winding shores &amp; low points of land cover'd with green inclosures, white farm-houses looking out among the trees,
						&amp; cattle feeding. the water is almost every where border'd with cultivated lands gently sloping upwards till they reach the feet
						of the mountains, wch rise very rude &amp; aweful with their broken tops on either hand. directly in front at better than 3 mile's
						distance, <hi rend="italic">Place-Fell,</hi>
						 one of the bravest among them, pushes its bold broad breast into the midst of the Lake &amp; forces
						it to alter it's course, forming first a large bay to the left &amp; then bending to the right.</p>
            <p>I descended <hi rend="italic">Dunmallert</hi> again by a side avenue, that was only not perpendicular, &amp; came to <hi rend="italic">Barton</hi>-bridge over the <hi rend="italic">Eeman,</hi> then walking thro' a path in the wood round the bottom of the
						hill came forth, where the <hi rend="italic">Eeman</hi> issues out of the lake, &amp; continued my way along it's western shore close
						to the water, &amp; generally on a level with it. Saw a cormorant flying over it &amp; fishing.... (to be continued)</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I hope you got safe and well home after that troublesome night: I long to hear you say so. for me I have continued well, been so
						favour'd by the weather, that my walks have never once been hinder'd till yesterday, (that is during a fortnight &amp; 3 or 4 days,
						&amp; a journey of 300 miles, &amp; more) &amp; am now at Aston for two days. tomorrow I go towards Cambridge: Mason is not here, but
						Mr Alderson receives me. my best respects to the family!</p>

               <salute>Adieu! I am ever <lb/> Yours (pray, tell me about Stonhewer).
