         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Hence vain deluding Joys</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is our motto hier, written on every feature, and ourly spoken by every solitary Chapel
            bel; So that decently you cant expect no other but a very grave letter. I realy beg
            you pardon to wrap up my thoughts in so smart a dress as an in quarto sheet. I know
            they should apear in a folio leave, but the Ideas themselves shall look so solemn
            as to belie their dress.–Tho' I wear not yet the black gown, and am only an inferior
            Priest in the temple of Meditation, yet my countenance is already consecrated. I never
            walk but with even steps and musing gate, and looks comercing with the skyes; and
            unfold my wrinkles only when I see mr. Gray, or think of you. Then nothwithstanding
            all your learnings and knowledge, I feel in such occasions that I have a heart, which
            you know is as some others a quite prophane thing to carry under a black gown.</p>
         <p>I am in a hurry from morning till evening.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> At 8 o Clock I am roused by a young square Cap, with whom I follow Satan through
            Chaos and night. He explaind me in Greek and latin, the <span style="font-style:italic">sweet reluctant amorous Delays</span> of our Grandmother Eve. We finish our travels in a copious breakfeast of muffins
            and tea. Then apears Shakespair and old Lineus<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> strugling together as two ghost would do for a damned Soul. Sometimes the one get
            the better sometimes the other. Mr Gray, whose acquaintance is my greatest debt to
            you, is so good as to shew me Macbeth, and all witches Beldams, Ghost and Spirits,
            whose language I never could have understood without his Interpretation. I am now
            endeavouring to dress all those people in a french dress, which is a very hard labour.</p>
         <p>I am afraid to take a room, which Mr. Gray shall keep still much better. So I stop
            hier my everrambling pen. My respectful Compliments to Md. Nichole. Only remember
            that you have no where a better or more grateful friend than your de Bonstetten. –I
            loosd Mr. Wheeler<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> letter and his direction.</p>
