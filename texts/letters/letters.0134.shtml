   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>I am not lost: here am I at Stoke, whither I came on Tuesday,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; shall be again in Town on Saturday,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; at Cambridge on Wednesday or Thursday.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you may be curious to know what has past.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I wrote a Note the Night I came,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; immediately received a very civil Answer. I went the following Evening<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to see <span style="font-style:italic">the Party</span> (as Mrs. Foible<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> says) was something abash'd at his Confidence: he came to meet me, kiss'd me on both
         Sides with all the Ease of one, who receives an Acquaintance just come out of the
         Country, squatted me into a Fauteuil, begun to talk of the Town &amp; this &amp; that &amp; t'other,
         &amp; continued with little Interruption for three Hours, when I took my Leave very indifferently
         pleased, but treated with wondrous Good-breeding. I supped with him next night (as
         he desired) Ashton was there, whose Formalities tickled me inwardly, for he I found
         was to be angry about the Letter I had wrote him.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> however in going home together our Hackney-Coach jumbled us into a Sort of Reconciliation:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he hammer'd out somewhat like an Excuse; &amp; I received it very readily, because I
         cared not two pence, whither it were true or not. so we grew the best Acquaintance
         imaginable, &amp; I set<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with him on Sunday some Hours alone, when he inform'd me of abundance of Anecdotes
         much to my Satisfaction, &amp; in short open'd (I really believe) his Heart to me with
         that Sincerity, that I found I had still less Reason to have a good Opinion of him,
         than (if possible) I ever had before. next Morning<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I breakfasted alone with Mr W: when we had all the Eclaircissement I ever expected,
         &amp; I left him far better satisfied, than I had been hitherto. when I return, I shall
         see him again. such is the Epitome of my four Days.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mr &amp; Mrs Simms &amp; Madlle Nanny<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> have done the Honours of Leaden Hall<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to a Miracle, &amp; all joyn in a Compliment to the Doctor. your Brother<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is well, the Books are in good Condition. Madme Chenevix<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has frightened me with Ecritoires she asks three Guinea's for, that are not worth
         three half pence: I have been in several Shops &amp; found nothing pretty. I fear it must
         be bespoke at last.
      </p>
      <p>the Day after I went you received a little Letter directed to me, that seems wrote
         with a Skewer. please to open it, &amp; you'll find a receipt of Dan: Adcock for ten Pound,
         wch I will beg you to receive of Gillham<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for me. if the Letter miscarried, pray take care the Money is paid to no one else.
         I expect to have a Letter from you when I come to Town, at your Lodgeings....<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Adieu, Sr,
