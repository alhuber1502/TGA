            <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>Excuse me, if I begin to wonder a little, that I have heard no news of you in so long a time. I conclude, you received Dodsley's
					packet at least a week ago, &amp; made my presents. you will not wonder therefore at my curiosity, if
					I enquire of you, what you hear said? for tho' in the rest of the world I do not expect to hear, that any body says much, or thinks
					about the matter yet among <hi rend="italic">mes Confreres,</hi> the Learned, I know there is alway leisure at least to find fault, if
					not to commend.</p>
         <p>I have been lately much out of order; &amp; confined at home, but now I go abroad again. Mr Garrick &amp; his Wife have pass'd some
					days at my Lady Cobham's, &amp; are shortly to return again; they &amp; a few other people, that I see
					there, have been my only entertainment till this week: but now I have purchased some volumes of the Great French Encyclopedie, &amp; am trying to amuse myself within doors.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>pray tell me a great deal, &amp; believe me ever most faithfully<lb/> Yours </salute>
