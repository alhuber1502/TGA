         <p>(Which is a dear more than I give any body else. it is very odd to begin with a Parenthesis,
            but) You may think me a Beast, for not haveing sooner wrote to you, &amp; to be sure a
            Beast I am. now when one owns it, I don't see what you have left to say. I take this
            opportunity to inform you (an opportunity I have had every week this twelvemonth)
            that I am arrived safe at Calais, &amp; am at present at Florence, a city in Italy in
            I don't know how many degrees N: latitude. under the Line I am sure it is not, for
            I am at this instant expireing with Cold. You must know, that not being certain what
            circumstances of my History would particularly suit your curiosity, &amp; knowing that
            all I had to say to you would overflow the narrow limits of many a good quire of Paper,
            I have taken this method of laying before you the contents, that you may pitch upon
            what you please, &amp; give me your orders accordingly to expatiate thereupon: for I conclude
            you will write to me; won't you? oh! yes, when you know, that in a week I set out
            for Rome, &amp; that the Pope is dead,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; that I shall be (I should say, God willing; &amp; if nothing extraordinary intervene;
            &amp; if I'm alive, &amp; well; &amp; in all human probability) at the Coronation of a new one.
            now as you have no other correspondent there, &amp; as if you do not, I certainly shall
            not write again (observe my impudence) I take it to be your interest to send me a
            vast letter, full of all sorts of News, &amp; Bawdy, &amp; Politics, &amp; such other ingredients,
            as to you shall seem convenient with all decent expedition. only do not be too severe
            upon the Pretender;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;, if you like my Style, pray say so. this is à la Françoise; &amp; if you think it a
            little too foolish, &amp; impertinent; you shall be treated alla Toscana with a thousand
            Signoria Illustrissima's. in the mean time I have the honour to remain
