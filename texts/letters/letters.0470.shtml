   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>At my return from Scotland instead of seeing you I find an empty house, &amp; an uncomfortable
         account of your situation: that you have been very ill with the gout in both feet,
         that you have been some time in France<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for your health, that you have got no farther than Paris, have again been confined
         there, &amp; are just beginning to go abroad again. at the hazard of being call'd an old
         woman I will take upon me to desire, when the fit is actually upon you, that you will
         make no sudden changes in your diet, I do not say in quantity, but in quality. that
         when you are recovering &amp; the pain is gone, but has left behind it a weakness in the
         joint, you will not be too indulgent to that weakness: but give yourself so much of
         motion &amp; exercise, as you can well endure. above all, keep your legs warmer at all
         times, whether you are well or ill, in bed or up, than you have commonly used to do,
         &amp; as far as may be, always in the same temperature. the quantity of wine you have
         commonly used has been so inconsiderable, that I do not believe it ever did, or will
         hurt you: but if you leave it off, mix a little quantity of spirit, brandy or whatever
         else is palatable to you, with your water. remember, it is only the wine-drinking
         nations, that know what the gout is: whereas those, that even indulge themselves in
         distill'd liquours, as well the laborious &amp; hard-faring people, as the indolent &amp;
         luxurious, tho' subject to many other disorders, are utter strangers to this. my prescriptions
         are simple, but they are such as I use myself, who am a Fellow-sufferer with you,
         about your own age,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> have (unhappily for me) a better right to this malady than you, begun to feel it
         earlier, &amp; yet have hitherto felt it mildly, &amp; never in my stomach or head. I only
         say, they are better than French Nostrums, or People of Qualitie's receipts. you will
         do me pleasure (if you are able) in telling me yourself, how you do, for I have no
         body but your Servants to inform me.</p>
      <p>I am come back from the Highlands very much the better for my journey &amp; (what I little
         expected) very much pleased with what I have seen.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I would send you <span style="font-style:italic">English news,</span> but that I know, you receive it from much better hands. they tell me <span style="font-style:italic">our</span> Ministry will stand upon its legs, tho' they have lost the Duke.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there are three separations I hear talk'd of in the married world, the Boling:s,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Shelb:s<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the Warkw:;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the last I believe may be true.</p>
