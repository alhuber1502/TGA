         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>I ought to have informed you sooner, that I had received the Ticket<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you were so good to buy for me, but I have been obliged to go every day almost to
         Stoke-house,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> where the Garricks have been all the last week. they are now gone, &amp; I am not sorry
         for it, for I grow so old, that, I own, People in high spirits &amp; gayety overpower
         me, &amp; entirely take away mine. I can yet be diverted with their sallies, but if they
         appear to take notice of my dullness, it sinks me to nothing. I do not know, whether
         you will blame me, but I found so good an opportunity given me of entering into the
         quarrel between M:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and him, that I could not help seizing it, &amp; trying to shew him the folly of hearkening
         to half-witted friends &amp; tale-bearers; and the greater folly of attempting to hurt,
         or merely to pique, so worthy &amp; so estimable a Man. if I did nothing else, I at least
         convinced him, that I spoke entirely from myself; &amp; that I had the most entire good
         opinion &amp; most unalterable respect as well as kindness for M:n.
      </p>
      <p>I congratulate you on our successes, &amp; condole with you on our misfortunes:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but do you think we draw the nearer to any happy conclusion of the war, or that we
         can bear so great a burthen much longer. the K: of Prussia's situation embarrasses
         me, surrounded as he is, &amp; reduced to the defence of his own little Marquisate.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Your Encyclopedie<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is the object of my envy. I am reduced to French plays &amp; novels, Willis's mitred
         Abbies,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the History of Norfolk<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in 3 volumes Folio. these latter Authors have, I think, the most wit, tho' the others
         know rather more of the World.
      </p>
      <p>I wish the air of Hampstead were not so necessary to you all, but am glad you always
         know where to find health, &amp; that she<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> lives so near you. I continue better than has been usual for me in the summer, tho'
         I neither walk, nor take any thing: 'tis in mind only, that I am weary &amp; disagreeable.
         Mrs R:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is declining every day, her stomach gone, very weak, sometimes giddy, &amp; subject to
         disorders in her bowels: yet I do not apprehend any immediate danger, but believe
         she will be reduced to keep her bed entirely.
      </p>
      <p>My best compliments to Mrs Wharton. pray let me hear from you as often as you are
         in a humour for writing, tho' from hence I can requite your kindness with so little
         to amuse you.
      </p>
