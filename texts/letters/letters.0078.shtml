      </div>
      <p>Scavez vous bien, mon cher ami, que je vous hais, que je vous deteste? voila des termes
         un peu forts; and that will save me, upon a just computation, a page of paper and
         six drops of ink; which, if I confined myself to reproaches of a more moderate nature,
         I should be obliged to employ in using you according to your deserts. What! to let
         any body reside three months at Rheims, and write but once to them? Please to consult
         Tully de Amicit. page 5, line 25, and you will find it said in express terms, 'Ad
         amicum inter Remos relegatum mense uno quinquies scriptum esto;' nothing more plain,
         or less liable to false interpretations. Now because, I suppose, it will give you
         pain to know we are in being, I take this opportunity to tell you that we are at the
         ancient and celebrated Lugdunum, a city situated upon the confluence of the Rhône
         and Saône (Arar, I should say) two people, who, though of tempers extremely unlike,
         think fit to join hands here, and make a little party to travel to the Mediterranean
         in company; the lady comes gliding along through the fruitful plains of Burgundy,
         incredibili lenitate, ita ut oculis in utram partem fluat judicari non possit; the
         gentleman runs all rough and roaring down from the mountains of Switzerland to meet
         her; and with all her soft airs she likes him never the worse; she goes through the
         middle of the city in state, and he passes incog. without the walls, but waits for
         her a little below. The houses here are so high, and the streets so narrow, as would
         be sufficient to render Lyons the dismallest place in the world, but the number of
         people, and the face of commerce diffused about it, are, at least, as sufficient to
         make it the liveliest: Between these two sufficiencies, you will be in doubt what
         to think of it; so we shall leave the city, and proceed to its environs, which are
         beautiful beyond expression; it is surrounded with mountains, and those mountains
         all bedroped and bespeckled with houses, gardens, and plantations of the rich Bourgeois,
         who have from thence a prospect of the city in the vale below on one hand, on the
         other the rich plains of the Lyonnois, with the rivers winding among them, and the
         Alps, with the mountains of Dauphiné, to bound the view. All yesterday morning we
         were busied in climbing up Mount Fourviere, where the ancient city stood perched at
         such a height, that nothing but the hopes of gain could certainly ever persuade their
         neighbours to pay them a visit: Here are the ruins of the Emperors' palaces, that
         resided here, that is to say, Augustus and Severus; they consist in nothing but great
         masses of old wall, that have only their quality to make them respected. In a vineyard
         of the Minims are remains of a theatre; the Fathers, whom they belong to, hold them
         in no esteem at all, and would have showed us their sacristy and chapel instead of
         them: The Ursuline Nuns have in their garden some Roman baths, but we having the misfortune
         to be men, and heretics, they did not think proper to admit us. Hard by are eight
         arches of a most magnificent aqueduct, said to be erected by Antony, when his legions
         were quartered here: There are many other parts of it dispersed up and down the country,
         for it brought the water from a river many leagues off in La Forez. Here are remains
         too of Agrippa's seven great roads which met at Lyons; in some places they lie twelve
         feet deep in the ground: In short, a thousand matters that you shall not know, till
         you give me a description of the Païs de Tombridge, and the effect its waters have
         upon you.
