					       <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>You are so forgetful of me, that I should not forgive it, but that I suppose Caractacus may be the better for it. yet I hear nothing
					from him neither in spite of his promises: there is no faith in Man, no, not in a Welch-Man, and yet Mr Parry has been here, &amp; scratch'd out such ravishing blind Harmony, such tunes of a thousand year old with
					names enough to choak you, as have set all this learned body a'dancing, &amp; inspired them with due reverence for <hi rend="italic">Odikle,</hi> whenever it shall appear. Mr Parry (you must know) it was, that has put Odikle in motion again, &amp; with much exercise
					it has got a <hi rend="italic">tender Tail</hi> grown, like Scroddles, and here it is. if you don't like it, you may kiss it.</p>
				     <p>You remember the <hi rend="italic">Visions of Glory,</hi> that descended on the heighths of Snowdon, &amp; unroll'd their glitt'ring
					skirts so slowly.
				</p>
				     <q>
					       <p>ANTIST: 3a. </p>
					       <p>Haughty Knights, &amp; Barons bold <lb/> With dazzling helm &amp; horrent spear, <lb/> And gorgeous Dames, &amp; Statesmen old
						<lb/> Of bearded majesty, appear: <lb/> In the midst a Form divine; <lb/> Her Eye proclaims her born of Arthur's line, <lb/> Her
						lyon-port, her awe-commanding face, <lb/> Attemper'd sweet to Virgin-grace. <lb/> What strings symphonious tremble in the air?
						<lb/> What strains of vocal transport round her play? <lb/> Hear from the grave, great Taliessin, hear! <lb/> They breath a Soul to
						animate thy clay. <lb/> Bright Rapture wakes, &amp; soaring, as she sings, <lb/> Waves in the eye of heaven her many-colour'd wings. </p>
					       <p>EPODE 3a. </p>
					       <p>The Verse adorn again <lb/> Fierce War &amp; faithful Love, <lb/> And Truth severe by fairy Fiction drest. <lb/> In mystic
						measures move <lb/> Pale Grief, &amp; pleasing Pain, <lb/> With Horror wild, that chills the throbbing breast. <lb/> A Voice as of
						the Cherub-Quire <lb/> Gales from blooming Eden bear; <lb/> And distant warblings lessen on my ear, <lb/> That lost in long
						futurity expire. <lb/> Fond impious Man! thinkst thou, yon sanguine cloud <lb/> Raised by thy breath has quench'd the Orb of Day?
						<lb/> Tomorrow he repairs the golden flood, <lb/> And warms the Nations with redoubled ray. <lb/> Enough for me. with joy I see
						<lb/> The diff'rent doom our Fates assign: <lb/> Be thine Despair, &amp; sceptred care; <lb/> To triumph &amp; to die are mine.
						<lb/> He spoke, &amp; headlong from the mountain's height <lb/> Deep in the roaring tide he sunk to endless night.
					</p>
				     </q>
				     <p>I am well aware of many weakly things here, but I hope the End will do. pray, give me your full &amp; true opinion, &amp; that not
					upon deliberation, but forthwith. Mr Hurd himself allows, that <hi rend="italic">lyon-port</hi> is not too bold for Q: Elizabeth. all
					here are well, &amp; desire their respects to you. I read yesterday of a Canonry of Worc:r vacant in the News-paper.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu, dear Mason, &amp; believe me most truly<lb/> Yours. </salute>
				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p>It will not be long, before I shall go to London. </p>
