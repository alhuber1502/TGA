      <p>I received from Mr Williamson<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that very obliging mark you were pleased to give me of your remembrance. had I not
         entertain'd some slight hopes of revisiting Scotland this summer, &amp; consequently of
         seeing you at Aberdeen, I had sooner acknowledged by letter the favor you have done
         me. those hopes are now at an end: but I do not therefore despair of seeing again
         a country, that has given me so much pleasure; nor of telling you in person how much
         I esteem you, &amp; (as you chuse to call them) your <span style="font-style:italic">amusements.</span> the specimen<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of them, wch you were so good to send me, I think excellent. the sentiments are such
         as a melancholy imagination naturally suggests in solitude &amp; silence, &amp; that (tho'
         light &amp; business may suspend or banish them at times) return with but so much the
         greater force upon a feeling heart. the diction is elegant &amp; unconstrain'd, not loaded
         with epithets &amp; figures, nor flagging into prose. the versification is easy &amp; harmonious.
         my only objection is to the first part of this line

      </div>
      <p> where the consonants are harsh &amp; frequent, tho' the image is good &amp; the words in
         all other respects well chosen. a Friend<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of mine, to whom I shew'd these verses, rather blames the choice of your measure,
         as appropriated to comic, or at most to pastoral subjects: but I do not think his
         criticism of much weight. you see, Sr, I take the liberty you indulged me in, when
         I first saw you, &amp; therefore I make no excuses for it, but desire you would take your
         revenge on me in kind.
      </p>
      <p>I have read over (but too hastily) Mr Ferguson's book.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there are uncommon strains of eloquence in it, &amp; I was surprised to find not one
         single idiom of his country (I think) in the whole work. he has not the fault you
         mention: his application to the heart is frequent, &amp; often successful. his love of
         Montesquiou &amp; Tacitus has led him into a manner of writing too short-winded &amp; sententious,
         wch those great Men had they lived in better times &amp; under a better government would
         have avoided.
      </p>
      <p>I know no pretence, that I have, to the honor Lord Gray is pleased to do me:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but if his Ldp chuses to own me, it certainly is not my business to deny it. I say
         not this merely on account of his quality: but because he is a very worthy &amp; accomplish'd
         Person. I am truly sorry for the great loss<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he has had, since I left Scotland. if you should chance to see him, I will beg you
         to present my respectful humble service to his Lordship.
      </p>
      <p>I gave Mr Williamson all the information I was able in the short time he stay'd with
         me. he seem'd to answer well the character you gave me of him: but what I chiefly
         envied in him was his ability of walking all the way from Aberdeen to Cambridge, &amp;
         back again, wch if I possess'd, you would soon see
