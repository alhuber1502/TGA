      </div>
      <p>I grow impatient to be in Town, &amp; hope for the pleasure of seeing you on Tuesday next.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I must confess, the present revolution of affairs,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch are settling so slowly, is some spur to my curiosity, tho' my own interests have
         no more concern in it, than those of any Cottager in the nation. I flatter myself,
         that necessity will at last throw the management of affairs into more capable, if
         not more honest hands, than usual. my Gazette<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> says, that Mr. P:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> will be Sec: of State, &amp; has accepted it (tho' ill of the Gout in the Country) that
         the D: of Devonshire<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has consented (wch was one of the conditions of acceptance) to be at the head of
         the Treasury. Ld Temple<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of the Admiralty. G: Grenville,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Paymaster. Mr Legge<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Chanc:r of the Exchequer. Sr G: Lee<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Sec: at War. Mr. F:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> nothing. how far all this is fact, you know by this time. I do not forget your letter,
         when I say this, &amp; to whom it was wrote; but I much doubt, whether you would have
         received more benefit from his good-offices, while he continued in, than now he is
         in effect out.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I am concerned too for another person,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who surely can never continue, where he is (if he should, it is a wonderful proof
         of the force of insignificancy) &amp; if he does not, a good Friend<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of ours must feel it a little in a part very tender to most people, his hopes; but
         he very wisely has been arming it for some time, I believe, with a reasonable insensibility,
         &amp; taking, by way of precaution a dose of my sovereign anodyne Fastidium.
      </p>
      <p>Don't fancy to yourself, that I have been doing any thing here. I am as stupid as
         a Post, &amp; have not added a syllable,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but in plain prose am still
