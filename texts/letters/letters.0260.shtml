      <p>I grow impatient to be in Town, &amp; hope for the pleasure of seeing you on Tuesday next.
         I must confess, the present revolution of affairs, wch are settling so slowly, is
         some spur to my curiosity, tho' my own interests have no more concern in it, than
         those of any Cottager in the nation. I flatter myself, that necessity will at last
         throw the management of affairs into more capable, if not more honest hands, than
         usual. my Gazette says, that Mr. P: will be Sec: of State, &amp; has accepted it (tho'
         ill of the Gout in the Country) that the D: of Devonshire has consented (wch was one
         of the conditions of acceptance) to be at the head of the Treasury. Ld Temple of the
         Admiralty. G: Grenville, Paymaster. Mr Legge Chanc:r of the Exchequer. Sr G: Lee Sec:
         at War. Mr. F: nothing. how far all this is fact, you know by this time. I do not
         forget your letter, when I say this, &amp; to whom it was wrote; but I much doubt, whether
         you would have received more benefit from his good-offices, while he continued in,
         than now he is in effect out. I am concerned too for another person, who surely can
         never continue, where he is (if he should, it is a wonderful proof of the force of
         insignificancy) &amp; if he does not, a good Friend of ours must feel it a little in a
         part very tender to most people, his hopes; but he very wisely has been arming it
         for some time, I believe, with a reasonable insensibility, &amp; taking, by way of precaution
         a dose of my sovereign anodyne Fastidium.
      </p>
      <p>Don't fancy to yourself, that I have been doing any thing here. I am as stupid as
         a Post, &amp; have not added a syllable, but in plain prose am still
      </p>
