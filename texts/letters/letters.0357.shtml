   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>I am so charmed with the two specimens of Erse poetry,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that I cannot help giving you the trouble to enquire a little farther about them,
         and should wish to see a few lines of the original, that I may form some slight idea
         of the language, the measures, and the rhythm.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Is there anything known of the author or authors, and of what antiquity are they supposed
         to be? </p>
      <p>Is there any more to be had of equal beauty, or at all approaching to it?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I have been often told that the poem called Hardicanute (which I always admired, and
         still admire) was the work of somebody that lived a few years ago.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> This I do not at all believe, though it has evidently been retouched in places by
         some modern hand: but, however, I am authorised by this report to ask, whether the
         two poems in question are certainly antique and genuine. I make this enquiry in quality
         of an antiquary, and am not otherwise concerned about it: for, if I were sure that
         any one now living in Scotland had written them to divert himself and laugh at the
         credulity of the world, I would undertake a journey into the Highlands only for the
         pleasure of seeing him.</p>
