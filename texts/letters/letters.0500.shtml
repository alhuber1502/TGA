         <div class="salute">Dear Mason </div>
      </div>
      <p>We are a-coming, but not so fast as you think for, because Mr Brown can not think
         of stirring till Whitsun-week is over. the Monday following<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> we propose to set out in our chaise: do not think of sending Benjamin,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I charge you. we shall find our way from Bautry very cleverly.</p>
      <p>I shall bring with me a drawing,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch Stuart<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has made. he approves your sketch highly, &amp; therefore (I suppose) has alter'd it
         in every particular, not at all for the better in my mind. he says, you should send
         him an account of the place &amp; position, &amp; a scale of the dimensions; this is what
         I modestly proposed before, but you give no ear to me. the relief, in artificial stone,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he thinks, would come to about eight guineas.</p>
      <p>Poor Mr Fitzherbert<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> had a second Son, who was at Caen: he complain'd of a swelling &amp; some pain in his
         knee, wch rather increasing upon him, his Father sent for him over. the Surgeons agreed,
         it was a White-swelling, &amp; he must lose his leg. he underwent the operation with great
         fortitude, but died the second day after it.</p>
