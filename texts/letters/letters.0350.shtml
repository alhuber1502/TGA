      <p>If you have been happy, where you are, or merely better in health for any of your
         employments, or idlenesses, you need no apologies with me: my end is answer'd, &amp; I
         am satisfied. one goes to school to the World some time, before one learns precisely
         how long a Visit ought to last. at this day I do not pretend to know it exactly, &amp;
         very often find out (when it is too late) that I have stay'd half an hour too long.
         I shall not wonder therefore, if your Friend should make a mistake of half a year,
         if your occasions did not call you to Town sooner. when you come, I should hope, you
         would stay the winter, but can advise nothing in a point, where my own interest is
         so much concerned. pray, let me know of your arrival immediately, that I may cut short
         my visitation here, or at least (if you are taken up always at Sion,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or Kensington<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>) may meet you at Hounslow,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or at Billy Robinson's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or somewhere. my only employment &amp; amusement in Town (where I have continued all
         the summer (till Michaelmas) has been the MusÃ¦um: but I have been rather historically
         than poetically given. with a little of your encouragement perhaps I may return to
         my old Lydgate &amp; Occleve,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whose works are there in abundance. I can write you no news from hence; yet I have
         lately heard <span style="font-style:italic">ill-news,</span> wch I shall not write.</p>

         <p>Your Friend, Dr Plumptree,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has lately sate for his picture to Wilson.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Motto in large letters (the measure of wch he himself prescribed) is, Non magna
