         <p>[ ] oming. I am sorry to tell you a sad story of our friend over the way. young V: who is now Chaplain to your new Bishop, &amp; has had the promise of it for some time, applied to his little red Ldship, as a friend to him &amp; to his family, to put him into orders. he begun by a direct Lie, &amp; told him,
					he knew the B:p was absolutely engaged to two People of Oxford, whom he named. then he drill'd him on
					with various trifling pretences, &amp; at last went to town without ordaining him, or appointing any time, when he would. in the mean
					time V: being press'd by Letters from home, went to town &amp; was immediately ordain'd by the A:p of York, &amp; soon after appointed Chaplain. he was inform'd from a very sure hand, that all this time his friend
					of Ch:r had been making interest for R–ss against him, &amp;
					particularly had said, that V: could not have it, for he was a young man, <hi rend="italic">not in Orders</hi> yet: I assure you, they
					are very angry (&amp; with reason), at R: Castle; [ ] Birch, [ ] between great Fact [ ] of none:
					however it is to be read. [I am reading Mad:] de Maintenon's Letters; they are undoubtedly genuine.
					they begin very early in her Life, before she married Scarron; &amp; continue after the King's Death
					to within a little while of her own. they bear all the Marks of a noble Spirit, (in her adversity particularly) of Virtue, &amp;
					unaffected Devotion, insomuch that I am almost persuaded she indulged Lewis the 14th in no Liberties, till he actually married her,
					&amp; this not out of Policy &amp; Ambition, but Conscience; for she was what we should call a Bigot, yet with great good-sense. in
					short she was too good for a Court; Misfortunes in the beginning of her Life had form'd her Mind (naturally lively &amp; impatient) to
					reflexion, &amp; a habit of piety; she was always miserable, while she had the care of Mad: de Montespan's children; timid &amp; very cautious of making Use of that unlimited Power she rose to afterwards for fear
					of trespassing on the King's Friendship for her; &amp; after his death, not at all afraid of meeting her own. I don't know what to say
					to you with regard to Racine: it sounds to me as if any body should fall upon Shakespear, who indeed lies infinitely more open to
					Criticism of all kinds, but I should not care to be the person that undertook it. if you don't like Athaliah, or Britannicus, there is
					no more to be said. I have done.</p>
         <p> Ross bears, or dissembles his disappointment better, than I expected of him: perhaps indeed it may not turn out to his disadvantage
					at the end. he is in London about something. have you seen Bishop Hall's Satires, call'd Virgidemiæ, republish'd lately. they are full of spirit &amp; poetry; as much of the first, as Dr Donne,
					&amp; far more of the latter. they were wrote at this University, when he was about 23 years old, in Q: Elizabeth's time.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu [ Brown &amp; Tuthill] send their best Compliments, with mine, to you &amp; Mrs
						Wharton. I am ever<lb/> Very sincerely yours, </salute>
