         <p>[ ] oming. I am sorry to tell you a sad story of our friend over the way. young V: who is now Chaplain to your new Bishop, &amp; has had the promise of it for some time, applied to his little red Ldship, as a friend to him &amp; to his family, to put him into orders. he begun by a direct Lie, &amp; told him,
					he knew the B:p was absolutely engaged to two People of Oxford, whom he named. then he drill'd him on
					with various trifling pretences, &amp; at last went to town without ordaining him, or appointing any time, when he would. in the mean
					time V: being press'd by Letters from home, went to town &amp; was immediately ordain'd by the A:p of York, &amp; soon after appointed Chaplain. he was inform'd from a very sure hand, that all this time his friend
					of Ch:r had been making interest for Râ€“ss against him, &amp;
					particularly had said, that V: could not have it, for he was a young man, <hi rend="italic">not in Orders</hi> yet: I assure you, they
					are very angry (&amp; with reason), at R: Castle; [ ] Birch, [ ] between great Fact [ ] of none:
					however it is to be read. [I am reading Mad:] de Maintenon's Letters; they are undoubtedly genuine.
					they begin very early in her Life, before she married Scarron; &amp; continue after the King's Death
					to within a little while of her own. they bear all the Marks of a noble Spirit, (in her adversity particularly) of Virtue, &amp;
					unaffected Devotion, insomuch that I am almost persuaded she indulged Lewis the 14th in no Liberties, till he actually married her,
					&amp; this not out of Policy &amp; Ambition, but Conscience; for she was what we should call a Bigot, yet with great good-sense. in
					short she was too good for a Court; Misfortunes in the beginning of her Life had form'd her Mind (naturally lively &amp; impatient) to
					reflexion, &amp; a habit of piety; she was always miserable, while she had the care of Mad: de Montespan's children; timid &amp; very cautious of making Use of that unlimited Power she rose to afterwards for fear
					of trespassing on the King's Friendship for her; &amp; after his death, not at all afraid of meeting her own. I don't know what to say
					to you with regard to Racine: it sounds to me as if any body should fall upon Shakespear, who indeed lies infinitely more open to
					Criticism of all kinds, but I should not care to be the person that undertook it. if you don't like Athaliah, or Britannicus, there is
					no more to be said. I have done.</p>
         <p> Ross bears, or dissembles his disappointment better, than I expected of him: perhaps indeed it may not turn out to his disadvantage
					at the end. he is in London about something. have you seen Bishop Hall's Satires, call'd VirgidemiÃ¦, republish'd lately. they are full of spirit &amp; poetry; as much of the first, as Dr Donne,
					&amp; far more of the latter. they were wrote at this University, when he was about 23 years old, in Q: Elizabeth's time.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu [ Brown &amp; Tuthill] send their best Compliments, with mine, to you &amp; Mrs
						Wharton. I am ever<lb/> Very sincerely yours, </salute>
