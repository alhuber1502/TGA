         <p>Wd at N:W. clouds &amp; sunshine. a mile &amp; Â½ from Brough on a hill lay a great army encamp'd.
            to the left open'd a fine valley with green meadows &amp; hedge-rows, a Gentleman's house
            peeping forth from a grove of old trees. on a nearer approach appear'd myriads of
            horses &amp; cattle in the road itself &amp; in all the fields round me, a brisk stream hurrying
            cross the way, thousands of clean healthy People in their best party-color'd apparel,
            Farmers &amp; their families, Esquires &amp; their daughters, hastening up from the dales
            &amp; down the fells on every side, glittering in the sun &amp; pressing forward to join the
            throng: while the dark hills, on many of whose tops the mists were yet hanging, served
            as a contrast to this gay &amp; moving scene, wch continued for near two miles more along
            the road, and the crowd (coming towards it) reach'd on as far as Appleby.
         </p>
         <p>On the ascent of the hill above Appleby the thick hanging wood &amp; the long reaches
            of the Eden (rapid, clear, &amp; full as ever) winding below with views of the Castle
            &amp; Town gave much employment to the mirror: but the sun was wanting &amp; the sky overcast.
            oats &amp; barley cut every where, but not carried in. passed Kirby-thore, Sr W: Dalston's
            house at Acorn bank, Whinfield-park, Harthorn-oaks, Countess-pillar, Brougham-Castle,
            Mr Brown (one of ye six Clerks) his large new house, cross'd the Eden &amp; the Eimot
            (pronounce <span style="font-style:italic">Eeman</span>) with its green vale, &amp; at 3 o'clock dined with Mrs Buchanan, at <span style="font-style:italic">Penrith</span> on trout &amp; partridge. in the afternoon walk'd up the <span style="font-style:italic">Beacon-hill</span> a mile to the top, saw Whinfield and Lowther-parks, &amp; thro' an opening in the bosom
            of that cluster of mountains, wch the Doctor well remembers, the Lake of Ulz-water,
            with the craggy tops of a hundred nameless hills. these to W: &amp; S:, to the N: a great
            extent of black &amp; dreary plains, to E: <span style="font-style:italic">Cross-fell</span> just visible thro' mists &amp; vapours hovering round it.
         </p>
         <p>Oct: 1. Wd at S:W: a grey autumnal day, air perfectly calm &amp; gentle. went to see <span style="font-style:italic">Ulz-water</span> 5 miles distant. soon left the Keswick-road &amp; turn'd to the left thro' shady lanes
            along the Vale of <span style="font-style:italic">Eeman,</span> wch runs rapidly on near the way, ripling over the stones. to the right is <span style="font-style:italic">Delmaine,</span> a large fabrick of pale red stone with 9 windows in front &amp; 7 on the side built by
            Mr Hassel, behind it a fine lawn surrounded by woods &amp; a long rocky eminence rising
            over them. a clear &amp; brisk rivulet runs by the house to join the Eeman, whose course
            is in sight &amp; at a small distance.
         </p>
         <p>Farther on appears <span style="font-style:italic">Hatton St John,</span>  a castle-like old mansion of Mr Huddleston. approach'd <span style="font-style:italic">Dunmallert,</span> a fine pointed hill, cover'd with wood planted by old Mr Hassle beforemention'd,
            who lives always at home &amp; delights in planting. walk'd over a spungy meadow or two
            &amp; began to mount this hill thro' a broad &amp; strait green alley among the trees, &amp; with
            some toil gain'd the summit. from hence saw the Lake opening directly at my feet majestic
            in its calmness, clear &amp; smooth as a blew mirror with winding shores &amp; low points
            of land cover'd with green inclosures, white farm-houses looking out among the trees,
            &amp; cattle feeding. the water is almost every where border'd with cultivated lands gently
            sloping upwards till they reach the feet of the mountains, wch rise very rude &amp; aweful
            with their broken tops on either hand. directly in front at better than 3 mile's distance,
            <span style="font-style:italic">Place-Fell,</span>  one of the bravest among them, pushes its bold broad breast into the midst of the
            Lake &amp; forces it to alter it's course, forming first a large bay to the left &amp; then
            bending to the right.
         </p>
         <p>I descended <span style="font-style:italic">Dunmallert</span> again by a side avenue, that was only not perpendicular, &amp; came to <span style="font-style:italic">Barton</span>-bridge over the <span style="font-style:italic">Eeman,</span> then walking thro' a path in the wood round the bottom of the hill came forth, where
            the <span style="font-style:italic">Eeman</span> issues out of the lake, &amp; continued my way along it's western shore close to the
            water, &amp; generally on a level with it. Saw a cormorant flying over it &amp; fishing....

            <div class="salute">Dear Dr </div>
         </div>
         <p>I hope you got safe and well home after that troublesome night: I long to hear you
            say so. for me I have continued well, been so favour'd by the weather, that my walks
            have never once been hinder'd till yesterday, (that is during a fortnight &amp; 3 or 4
            days, &amp; a journey of 300 miles, &amp; more) &amp; am now at Aston for two days. tomorrow I
            go towards Cambridge: Mason is not here, but Mr Alderson receives me. my best respects
            to the family!
         </p>
