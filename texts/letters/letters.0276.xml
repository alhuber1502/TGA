				     <p>I am extremely sorry to hear of poor Mr Bentley's illness. what I can not account for is, that You or He should trust such a Dog of
					an Apothecary, after he had shew'd himself, to do any thing, even to sell medecines; when it is just as easy for him to put in a grain
					of slow poison, as to administer a dose of pure &amp; innocent brown-Paper. </p>
				     <p>Dodsley sent me some copies last week: they are very pleasant to the eye, &amp; will do no dishonour
					to your Press. as you are but young in the trade, you will excuse me if I tell you, that some little inaccuracies have escaped your
					eye, as in the 9th page <hi rend="italic">Lab'rinth's</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Echo's,</hi>
					 (wch are Nominat:s plural,) with Apostrophes after them, as tho' they were Genitives singular; &amp;
					P: 16, sorrow &amp; solitude without capital letters. besides certain Commas here &amp; there omitted.
					if you do not commit greater faults in your next work, I shall grow jealous of Hentzerus.
				</p>
				     <p>I am going to add to the trouble I have given you by desiring you would tell me, what you hear any body say, (I mean, if any body
					says any thing). I know you will forgive this vanity of an Author, as the vanity of a Printer is a little interested in the same cause.
					the Garricks have been here for three days much to my entertainment. if you see him, do not fail to
					make him tell you the story of <hi rend="italic">Bull &amp; Poker.</hi>
