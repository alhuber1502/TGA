      <p>The inclosed which I have this minute received from Mr Bentley, explains much that
         I had to say to you – yet I have a question or two more.
      </p>
      <p>Who &amp; what sort of Man is a Mr Sharp<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Bennet? I have received a most obliging &amp; genteel letter<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> from him, with the very letter of Edw. 6th which you was so good as to send me. I
         have answered his, but shoud like to know a little more about him. Pray thank the
         Dean of Lincoln too for me; I am much obliged to him for his offer, but had rather
         draw upon his <span style="font-style:italic">Lincolnship</span> than his <span style="font-style:italic">Cambridgehood.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> In the library of the former are some original letters of Tiptoft,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as you will find in my Catalogue. When Dr. Greene is there, I shall be glad if he
         will let me have them copied.
      </p>
      <p>I will thank you if you will look in some provincial history of Ireland for Odo (Hugh)
         Oneil King of Ulster;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when did he live? I have got a most curious Seal of his, &amp; know no more of him than
         of Ouacraw King of the Paw-waws.
      </p>
      <p>I wanted to ask you whether you or anybody that you beleive in, beleive in the Q.
         of Scots' letter to Q. Elizabeth – If it is genuine, I dont wonder she cut her head
         off – but I think it must be some forgery that was not made use of.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Now to my distress – you must have seen an Advertisement, perhaps the book itself,
         the villainous book itself, that has been published to defend me against the Critical
         Review.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have been childishly unhappy about it, &amp; had drawn up a protestation or Affidavit
         of my knowing nothing of it, but my friends woud not let me publish it. I sent to
         the printer who woud not discover the Author – nor coud I guess. They tell me nobody
         can suspect my being privy to it, but there is an Intimacy affected that I think will
         deceive many – &amp; yet I must be the most arrogant fool living if I coud know &amp; suffer
         anybody to speak of me in that Style – For God's sake do all you can for me, and publish
         my Abhorrence. Today I am told that it is that puppy Dr Hill,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who has chosen to make war with the Magazines thro my Sides. I coud pardon him any
         abuse, but I never can forgive this <span style="font-style:italic">Friendship.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
