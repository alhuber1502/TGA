      <p>I have seen Dr Hurd, &amp; find the story I told you is not true, tho' (I thought) I had
         it on very good authority. he was indeed ill at Thurcaston, but not so since, &amp; walk'd
         an hour in Lincoln's-Inn walks with me very hearty, tho' his complexion presages no
         good. St: is come to town, &amp; in good health. the weather &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">the times</span> look very gloomy, &amp; hang on my spirits, tho' I go to the Italian Puppet-Shew (the
         reigning diversion) to exhilarate them. I return to Camb: on Tuesday next, where I
         desire you would send me a more exhilarating letter.
