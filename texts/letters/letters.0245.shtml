         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>Tho' I had no reasonable excuse for myself before I received your last letter, yet
         since that time I have had a pretty good one, having been taken up in quarrelling
         with Peter-house, &amp; in removing myself from thence to Pembroke.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> this may be look'd upon as a sort of Ã&#x86;ra<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in a life so barren of events as mine, yet I shall treat it in Voltaire's manner,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; only tell you, that I left my lodgings, because the rooms were noisy, &amp; the People
         of the house dirty. this is all I would chuse to have said about it; but if you in
         private should be curious enough to enter into a particular detail of facts &amp; minute
         circumstances, Stonhewer who was witness to them will probably satisfy you. all, I
         shall say more, is, that I am for the present extremely well lodged here,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; as quiet as in the Grande Chartreuse; &amp; that every body (even the Dr Longs<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Dr Mays<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>) are as civil, as they could be to Mary de Valence<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in person. with regard to any advice I can give as to the Hospital,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I freely own it ought to give way to Dr. H:s<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> counsels, who is a much better judge, &amp; (I should think) disinterested. I love refusals
         no more than you do; but as to your Effluvia, I maintain, that one sick <span style="font-style:italic">rich</span> has more of pestilence &amp; putrefaction about him, than a whole ward of sick Poor.</p>
      <p>You should have received Mason's present<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as last Saturday.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I desire you to tell me your critical opinion of the new Ode:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; also whether you have found out two lines, wch he has inserted in another of them,
         that are superlative.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> we do not expect, that the world, wch is just going to be <span style="font-style:italic">invaded,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> will bestow much attention on them. if you hear any thing, you will tell us.</p>
      <p>The similitude between the Italian Republicks &amp; those of ancient Greece has often
         struck me, as it does you. I do not wonder, that Sully's Memoirs<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> have highly entertain'd you. but can not agree with you in thinking him or his Master
         two of the <span style="font-style:italic">best Men</span> in the world. the King<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was indeed one of the best-natured Men, that ever lived. but it is owing only to
         chance, that his intended Marriage with Mad: d'EstrÃ©es, or with the Marq:se de Verneuil,
         did not involve him &amp; the kingdom in the most inextricable confusion; &amp; his design
         upon the Princess of CondÃ©<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (in his old age) was worse still. as to the Minister, his base application to Concini<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> after the murther of Henry has quite ruin'd him in my esteem,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; destroy'd all the merit of that honest surly Pride, for wch I honour'd him before.
         yet I own, that as Kings &amp; Ministers go, they were both extraordinary Men. pray look
         at the end of Birch's State Papers of Sr T: Edmonde's, for the Character of the French
         Court at that time, written by Sr George Carew.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Pray don't suspect me of any such <span style="font-style:italic">suspicions,</span> as you mention. I would hardly believe you were tired of me, tho' you told me so
         yourself, sensible as I am nevertheless, that you might have reason enough to be so.
         to prove what I say, I have thoughts of coming to you for three days in April. there
         is to be a Concerto Spirituale, in wch the Mingotti<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (who has just lain in) &amp; Ricciarelli will sing the <span style="font-style:italic">Stabat Mater</span> of Pergolesi.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> You &amp; Mason &amp; I are to be at it together, so pray make no excuses, nor put-offs.
         saving to you however the liberty of saying whether you have a bed to spare (I mean
         for me, not for him) in your house.</p>
