         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>Tho' I had no reasonable excuse for myself before I received your last letter, yet
         since that time I have had a pretty good one, having been taken up in quarrelling
         with Peter-house, &amp; in removing myself from thence to Pembroke. this may be look'd
         upon as a sort of Æra in a life so barren of events as mine, yet I shall treat it
         in Voltaire's manner, &amp; only tell you, that I left my lodgings, because the rooms
         were noisy, &amp; the People of the house dirty. this is all I would chuse to have said
         about it; but if you in private should be curious enough to enter into a particular
         detail of facts &amp; minute circumstances, Stonhewer who was witness to them will probably
         satisfy you. all, I shall say more, is, that I am for the present extremely well lodged
         here, &amp; as quiet as in the Grande Chartreuse; &amp; that every body (even the Dr Longs
         &amp; Dr Mays) are as civil, as they could be to Mary de Valence in person. with regard
         to any advice I can give as to the Hospital, I freely own it ought to give way to
         Dr. H:s counsels, who is a much better judge, &amp; (I should think) disinterested. I
         love refusals no more than you do; but as to your Effluvia, I maintain, that one sick
         <span style="font-style:italic">rich</span> has more of pestilence &amp; putrefaction about him, than a whole ward of sick Poor.
      </p>
      <p>You should have received Mason's present as last Saturday. I desire you to tell me
         your critical opinion of the new Ode: &amp; also whether you have found out two lines,
         wch he has inserted in another of them, that are superlative. we do not expect, that
         the world, wch is just going to be <span style="font-style:italic">invaded,</span>  will bestow much attention on them. if you hear any thing, you will tell us.
      </p>
      <p>The similitude between the Italian Republicks &amp; those of ancient Greece has often
         struck me, as it does you. I do not wonder, that Sully's Memoirs have highly entertain'd
         you. but can not agree with you in thinking him or his Master two of the <span style="font-style:italic">best Men</span> in the world. the King was indeed one of the best-natured Men, that ever lived. but
         it is owing only to chance, that his intended Marriage with Mad: d'Estrées, or with
         the Marq:se de Verneuil, did not involve him &amp; the kingdom in the most inextricable
         confusion; &amp; his design upon the Princess of Condé (in his old age) was worse still.
         as to the Minister, his base application to Concini after the murther of Henry has
         quite ruin'd him in my esteem, &amp; destroy'd all the merit of that honest surly Pride,
         for wch I honour'd him before. yet I own, that as Kings &amp; Ministers go, they were
         both extraordinary Men. pray look at the end of Birch's State Papers of Sr T: Edmonde's,
         for the Character of the French Court at that time, written by Sr George Carew.
      </p>
      <p>Pray don't suspect me of any such <span style="font-style:italic">suspicions,</span> as you mention. I would hardly believe you were tired of me, tho' you told me so
         yourself, sensible as I am nevertheless, that you might have reason enough to be so.
         to prove what I say, I have thoughts of coming to you for three days in April. there
         is to be a Concerto Spirituale, in wch the Mingotti (who has just lain in) &amp; Ricciarelli
         will sing the <span style="font-style:italic">Stabat Mater</span> of Pergolesi. You &amp; Mason &amp; I are to be at it together, so pray make no excuses,
         nor put-offs. saving to you however the liberty of saying whether you have a bed to
         spare (I mean for me, not for him) in your house.
      </p>
