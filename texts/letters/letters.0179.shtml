         <div class="salute">My dear Sir,</div>
      </div>
      <p>You have indeed conducted with great decency my little <span style="font-style:italic">misfortune</span>: you have taken a paternal care of it, and expressed much more kindness than could
         have been expected from so near a relation. But we are all frail; and I hope to do
         as much for you another time. Nurse Dodsley has given it a pinch or two in the cradle,
         that (I doubt) it will bear the marks of as long as it lives. But no matter: we have
         ourselves suffered under her hands before now;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and besides, it will only look the more careless, and by <span style="font-style:italic">accident</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as it were. I thank you for your advertisement, which saves my honour, and in a manner
         <span style="font-style:italic">bien flatteuse pour moi,</span> who should be put to it even to make myself a compliment in good English.</p>
      <p>You will take me for a mere poet, and a fetcher and carrier of singsong,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if I tell you that I intend to send you the beginning of a drama,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> not mine, thank God, as you'll believe, when you hear it is finished, but wrote by
         a person whom I have a very good opinion of. It is (unfortunately) in the manner of
         the ancient drama, with choruses, which I am, to my shame, the occasion of; for, as
         great part of it was at first written in that form, I would not suffer him to change
         it to a play fit for the stage, as he intended, because the lyric parts are the best
         of it, and they must have been lost. The story is Saxon, and the language has a tang
         of Shakespeare, that suits an old-fashioned fable very well. In short, I don't do
         it merely to amuse you, but for the sake of the author, who wants a judge, and so
         I would lend him <span style="font-style:italic">mine</span>: yet not without your leave, lest you should have us up to dirty our stockings at
         the bar of your house for wasting the time and politics of the <span style="font-style:italic">nation.</span></p>
