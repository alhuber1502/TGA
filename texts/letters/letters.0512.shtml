   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>You have indeed brought yourself into a little scrape. I would, if it were my own
         case, say to Ld L: (supposing you were pressed by him) that I had not received yet
         any letter from T:;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in the mean time I would write instantly to him in Devonshire, tell him my difficulty,
         &amp; how I got into it, &amp; desire his consent to shew Ld L: so much of his letter, as
         might be proper. I would then (supposing him not averse) have a cold or the tooth-ach,
         &amp; be detain'd at Richmond,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> from whence I would (transcribing so much of this very letter as may be fit for his
         Ldp to see) send it to him in Town, as the substance of what I had <span style="font-style:italic">just then</span> received in answer to my own. he will have suspicions (you will say) from my not
         shewing him the original. no matter! you are nothing to Ld L:; perhaps you had written
         to T: about other affairs, that you can not shew him; he will not be so uncivil as
         to ask for it; in short let him suspect, what he pleases: any thing is better, than
         to shew it him. and yet I would omitt nothing in my copy but what relates to <span style="font-style:italic">Berwick</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and to <span style="font-style:italic">the addition</span> that he should have made to the parsonage-house.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the kindness express'd for him toward the latter part of the letter will (if he cares
         for T:) make up for all the rest.</p>
      <p>By the way T: does himself much credit with me by this letter, &amp; I did not (begging
         his pardon) suspect him of writing so well. but yet I must stand up a little for Ld
         L:. what occasion pray for so many cordial letters (wch, if he were good for nothing
         at bottom, must have cost him some pains of head) &amp; for the bribe of a living, only
         to gain T:s vote &amp; interest, wch as a Relation &amp; Friend he would have had for nothing
         at all. is not the date he sets to the beginning of Ld L:s coldness to him carried
         a little too far back? did it not really begin a little later, when he had brought
         his wife to Mamhead, &amp; they did not much like her? these indeed are only conjectures,
         but they may be true. I have to be sure a little prejudice to Madam; but yet I must
         be candid enough to own that the parsonage-house sticks a little in my stomach. </p>
      <p>My best remembrances to Temple, &amp; tell him, I wish, he would not give too much way
         to his own sensibilities; &amp; still less (in this case) to the sensibilities of <span style="font-style:italic">other People.</span> it is always time enough to quarrel with one's Friends.</p>
