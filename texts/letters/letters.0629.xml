					       <dateline>Curzon Street: March 27th.</dateline>
					       <salute>Dear Mr Gray </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I find from Stonhewer that he has now £129 - 10 - 6, as appears by the acct on the opposite page.
					If therefore it be not inconvenient to you I should be glad to borrow £100 of you, for a little pocket money during the present
					sequestration of my Ecclesiastical &amp; temporal concerns. I wish you would favor me with a line as
					soon as may be on this matter, &amp; if you do not object to my proposal I will immediatly send you my Note wch I have the vanity to
					presume is as good as My bond. </p>
				     <p>S is perfectly well. The forthnights rest wch his feverish complaint obligd him to take totally removd his other malady; so that he
					has never had occasion to recur to his former applications wch both you &amp; I thought dangerous, &amp; I always unnecessary. </p>
				     <p>Wilson was with me yesterday. He has very gladly accepted the Tutoring of Mr Pierse, &amp; will
					write to Mr Brown shortly on that subject. I therefore turn the matter over entirely to him &amp; the Master.
				</p>
				     <p>The general opinion of what will be the business of the day is that the Lord Mayor on acct of his
					Gout will not be sent to the Tower but committed to the care of Bonfoy; whose pizzy-wizzy-ship will
					be horribly frighted on the occasion. The Mob is nothing in comparison of what you would [have]
					thought respectable when you interested yourself in those matters and attended them in Bloomsbury square.
				</p>
				     <p>I am much amused at present in being privy to a great Court secret known only to myself, the King,
					&amp; about 5 or 6 persons more in the world. I found it out by a Penetration wch would have done honour to a First Minister in the
					best of days, even in the days of Sr Robert or Fobus. When it is ripe for discovery I shall perhaps
					let you into some parts of it that will never be made public, in the meanwhile Mum is the word from</p>

				     </closer>

					       <p>I am glad the Master likes his Chairs my true love to him </p>
