      </div>
      <p>I am return'd from Aston, &amp; now wait your commands. my idea is, that we might meet
         on the first or second of July at Huntingdon or at the Wheat-Sheaf,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> 5 miles further on the Northern road (for I do not like to be here at the Commencement)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; thence find our way cross by Thrapston<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> into Warwickshire, so thro' Worcestershire, Shropshire, &amp; other of the midland counties
         for about three weeks; but the particular route &amp; objects we are to see I leave to
         be determined on joint consultation. the Wheat-sheaf I only mention as a very good
         Inn (tho' a little out of our way) where I possibly may go, &amp; wait a day or two for
         you. send me word, whether it suits you, &amp; precisely tell me the day you can come.
         my compliments to Mrs Nicholls.</p>
