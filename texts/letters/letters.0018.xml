					       <dateline>From Cambridge, 1735.</dateline>
            <lb/> In the style of Addison's <hi rend="italic">Travels.</hi>
            <lb/>
					       <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I believe you saw in the newspapers that I was going to make the tour of Italy; I shall therefore
					give you some account of the places I have seen, which are not to be found in Mr. Addison, whose method I shall follow. On 9th of Octr., 1735, we set out from Lodone<note anchored="true" n="a" place="margin">London.</note> (the
					Lugdunum of the Ancients), the capital city of Lombardy, in a chariot-and-four. About 11 o'clock, we arrived at a place the Italians
					call Tempialbulo.<note anchored="true" n="b" place="margin">White-chapel.</note> Virgil seems to have prophesied of this town when he
					says–</p>
				     <q>
					       <hi rend="italic">Amisit verum vetus Albula nomen.</hi>
					       <p>By <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> the founder's great design was crost, And <hi rend="italic">Albula</hi> its genuine title lost.</p>
				     </q>
				     <p>Here are no remains of Roman antiquity but a statue of Marc Aurelius,<note anchored="true" n="c" place="margin">Statue of King
						William at a stone-cutter's.</note> which the Lombards call Guglielmo Terzo, one of their kings, and some learned men<note anchored="true" n="d" place="margin">See Addison, <title>Trav.</title>, p. 26.<ref target="tg1b.4fm"/>
            </note> St. George and the
					Dragon. It is an equestrian statue, and almost equal to that of Charlemagne, at the Great Cross,<note anchored="true" n="e" place="margin">Statue of King Charles at Charing Cross.</note> at Lodone. The church is an old Gothic building, and reckoned the most
					ancient in Italy. Here was some time ago an altar-piece of the Lord's Supper, in which the painter having quarrelled with the
						Abbot<note anchored="true" n="f" place="margin">Dr. White Kennet, Bishop of Peter-borough.</note> of this church, represented him like
						Judas, with this epigram:–</p>
				     <q>
					       <hi rend="italic">Falleris, hâc qui te pingi sub imagine credis,</hi>
            <lb/>
					       <hi rend="italic">Non similis Judas est tibi–poenituit.</hi>
					       <lb/>
					       <lb/> Think not, vain man, thou here art represented, <lb/> Thou art not like to <hi rend="italic">Judas</hi>–he repented. </q>
				     <p>From thence we made the best of our way to a town, which in English we should call Stony-Stratford, and corresponds with the
					description which Virgil has given of it–</p>
				     <q> – <hi rend="italic">vivo praetervehor Ostia Saxo<lb/> Stratfordi, Megarosque sinus, Tapsumque iacentem.</hi>
				     </q>
				     <p>Those that follow are little dirty towns, that seem to have been built only to be 'knocked<note anchored="true" n="g" place="margin">Expression of Addison on this line.</note>' on the head, like</p>
				     <q>
					       <hi rend="italic">Antitheum, Glaucumque, Medontaque, Thersilochumque.</hi>
				     </q>
				     <p>The next town of note is Arc,<note anchored="true" n="h" place="margin">Bow.</note> so called from its being built in the shape of a
						bow–<hi rend="italic">ab Eoo curvatur in Arcum.</hi> From Arc we travelled through a very pleasant country to Epino,<note anchored="true" n="i" place="margin">Epping.</note> whose forest is celebrated by Virgil in these lines:–</p>
				     <q>
					       <hi rend="italic">Sylva Epini latè dumis, atque ilice nigrâ</hi>
            <lb/>
					       <hi rend="italic">Horrida, quam densi complerant undique sentes;</hi>
            <lb/>
					       <hi rend="italic">Rara per occultos ducebat semita calles.</hi>
					       <lb/>
					       <lb/>
					       <hi rend="italic">Epinum's</hi> woods with shrubs and gloomy oak<lb/> Horrid, and all with brambles thick o'ergrown, <lb/> Through
					which few narrow paths obscurely led. <lb/>
					       <bibl>
               <hi rend="italic">Mr. Trap.</hi>
            </bibl>
				     </q>
				     <p>We were here shown, at a distance, the thickets rendered so famous by the robberies of Gregorio.<note anchored="true" n="j" place="margin">Gregory, a noted highwayman. See Addison, <title>Trav.</title>, p. 1.<ref target="tg1b.10fm"/>
            </note> Here I was met
					by a very distant and troublesome relation. My namesake hints at such an one in those lines of his–</p>
				     <q>
					       <hi rend="italic">Accurrit quidam notus mihi nomine tantùm</hi>
            <lb/>
					       <hi rend="italic">Arreptâque manu, Quid agis, Cosinissime, rerum?</hi>

					       <bibl>Horace.</bibl>
            <lb/>
					       <lb/> There stepp'd up one to me I hardly knew, <lb/> Embraced me, and cried, Cousin, how d'ye do? <lb/>
					       <bibl>
               <hi rend="italic">Mr. Creech.</hi>
            </bibl>
				     </q>
				     <p>We lay that night at Oggerell,<note anchored="true" n="k" place="margin">Hockerel.<ref target="tg1b.11fm"/>
            </note> which is famous
					for nothing but being Horace's Oppidulo, <hi rend="italic">quod versu dicere non est.</hi>
				     </p>
				     <p>In our way to Parvulun,<note anchored="true" n="l" place="margin">Littlebury.</note> we saw a great castle,<note anchored="true" n="m" place="margin">Audley Inn, the seat of the Earl of Suffolk.</note> belonging to the Counts of Suffolcia: it is a vast pile of
					building, but quite in the old taste. Parvulun is a small village, but formerly remarkable for several miracles,<note anchored="true" n="n" place="margin">Winstanley's Wonders, or Tricks in Mechanics.</note> said to be performed there by a Welsh saint, who, like Jupiter, was suckled by a goat, whence they think it</p>
				     <q>
					       <hi rend="italic">Porrum et Caepe nefas violare.</hi> Juv.
				</q>
				     <p>The wonders of Parvulun are in great repute all over Lombardy. We have very bad ways from hence to Pont Ossoria,<note anchored="true" n="o" place="margin">Bone Bridge.</note> where are the ruins of a bridge that gives name to the town. The account they give of it is
					as follows:–St. Bona being desirous to pass over the river, met with a man who offered to carry her over; he took her up in his
					arms, and under pretence of doing her service, was going to ravish her; but she praying to the Virgin Mary for help, the wretch fell
					into the stream and was drowned, and immediately this bridge rose out of the water for her to go over. She was so touched with this
					signal deliverance, that she would not leave the place, but continued there till her death in exercises of devotion, and was buried in
					a little chapel at the foot of the bridge, with her story at length and this epitaph–<hi rend="italic">Hâc sita sunt fossâ Bonae
						Venerabilis ossa!</hi>
            <note anchored="true" n="p" place="margin">Epitaph of Venerable Bede.</note>
				     </p>
				     <p>From Pont Ossoria we travelled by land to Nuovo Foro<note anchored="true" n="q" place="margin">New-market.</note> (the Novum Forum of
					Jockius), where are held the greatest races in all Italy. We were shown in the treasury of the Benedictines' Convent an ancient gold
					cup which cost an hundred guineas (a great sum in those days), and given, as the friar told us that
					attended us, by a certain German Prince, he did not very well know who, but he believed his name was one King George.<note anchored="true" n="r" place="margin">See p. 78.</note> The inhabitants are wonderfully fond of horses, and to this day tell you most
					surprising stories of one Looby, a Boltognian. I saw a book dedicated to the head of that family, intituled <hi rend="italic">A
						Discourse on the Magnanimity of Bucephalus, and of the Duke of Boltogne's Horse Looby.</hi>
            <note anchored="true" n="s" place="margin">See p. 30.<ref target="tg1b.18fm"/> Duke of Bolton. <ref target="tg1b.19fm"/>
            </note>
					
				     </p>
				     <p>I staid here three days, and in my way to Pavia<note anchored="true" n="t" place="margin">Cambridge.</note> stopped at the Palace of
						Delfini,<note anchored="true" n="u" place="margin">Lord Godolphin's house on Gogmagog Hills.</note> which is built on the top of a
					large barren mountain, and at a distance looks like the Ark resting on Mount Ararat. This mountain is called Gog, and opposite to one
					called Magog. They are very dangerous precipices, and occasioned the famous verse –</p>
				     <q>
					       <hi rend="italic">Incidit in Gogum qui vult vitare Magogon.</hi>
            <note anchored="true" n="v" place="margin">Incidit in Scyllam qui vult
						vitare Charibdim.</note>
				     </q>
				     <p>I need not repeat the history of Gog and Magog, it being known to every child, and to be found at large in most books of travels. </p>
				     <p>Pavia and its University are described by Mr. Addison, so I shall only mention a circumstance which I wonder escaped that learned
					gentleman. It is the name of the town, which is derived from the badness of the streets: <hi rend="italic">Pavia à non pavendo,</hi> as
						<hi rend="italic">Lucus à non lucendo.</hi>
				     </p>
				     <p>Till next post, adieu! </p>
