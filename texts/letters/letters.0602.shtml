         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>When I return'd to Cambridge, I found a long letter from De B:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> expressing much kindness, but in a style <span style="font-style:italic">un peu trop alambiqu√©,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; yesterday I had another shorter,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; making bad excuses for not writing oftener: he seems at present to give into all
         the French nonsense &amp; to be employ'd much like an English boy broke loose from his
         Governor. I want much to know, whether he has wrote to you yet: if not, I am seriously
         angry, tho' to little purpose. A <span style="font-style:italic">Marquis de Villevielle,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who is here with the French Embassador,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has found me out, &amp; seems a quiet good sort of young Man. he knows &amp; tries to speak
         English, &amp; has <span style="font-style:italic">translated me</span> by way of exercise. that is our bond of union, but I have seen no specimen yet. he
         returns home soon with Mr de Chatelet; but means to return &amp; acquaint himself better
         with this country.
      </p>
      <p>On Monday or Tuesday<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I mean to leave this place &amp; after passing two or three days at Cambridge proceed
         to Aston,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> where Mason expects me. now if you like to accompany me, you will meet me at Camb:
         &amp; we pursue our way together, trees blooming &amp; nightingales singing all round us.
         let me know your mind &amp; direct to me at Camb:ge.
      </p>
      <p>I have not forgot your microscope, but my Mr Ramsden<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (Mason's Favourite) is such a Lyar &amp; a Fool, that ten to one it is not finish'd this
         month or two. my respects to Mrs. Nicholls! I hope the sermon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is compleated<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> between you.
