         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>When I return'd to Cambridge, I found a long letter from De B: expressing much kindness,
         but in a style <span style="font-style:italic">un peu trop alambiqu√©,</span>  &amp; yesterday I had another shorter, &amp; making bad excuses for not writing oftener:
         he seems at present to give into all the French nonsense &amp; to be employ'd much like
         an English boy broke loose from his Governor. I want much to know, whether he has
         wrote to you yet: if not, I am seriously angry, tho' to little purpose. A <span style="font-style:italic">Marquis de Villevielle,</span>  who is here with the French Embassador, has found me out, &amp; seems a quiet good sort
         of young Man. he knows &amp; tries to speak English, &amp; has <span style="font-style:italic">translated me</span> by way of exercise. that is our bond of union, but I have seen no specimen yet. he
         returns home soon with Mr de Chatelet; but means to return &amp; acquaint himself better
         with this country.
      </p>
      <p>On Monday or Tuesday I mean to leave this place &amp; after passing two or three days
         at Cambridge proceed to Aston, where Mason expects me. now if you like to accompany
         me, you will meet me at Camb: &amp; we pursue our way together, trees blooming &amp; nightingales
         singing all round us. let me know your mind &amp; direct to me at Camb:ge.
      </p>
      <p>I have not forgot your microscope, but my Mr Ramsden (Mason's Favourite) is such a
         Lyar &amp; a Fool, that ten to one it is not finish'd this month or two. my respects to
         Mrs. Nicholls! I hope the sermon is compleated between you.
      </p>
