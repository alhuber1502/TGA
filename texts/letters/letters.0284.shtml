         <div class="salute">Dear Doctr</div>
      </div>
      <p>I am greatly obliged to your care &amp; kindness for considering with more attention,
         than it deserves, the article of my health. at present I am far better, &amp; take long
         walks again, have better spirits, &amp; am more capable of amusement. the offer you make
         me of your lodgings for a time I should gladly embrace both for the sake of seeing
         you, &amp; for variety, &amp; because it will answer another end by furnishing me with a reason
         for not going into the country to <span style="font-style:italic">a place, where I am invited.</span>  (I think, you understand me) but the truth is, I can not afford to hurry about from
         place to place; so I shall continue, where I am, &amp; trust to <span style="font-style:italic">illness,</span> or some other cause for an excuse, since to <span style="font-style:italic">that place</span> I am positive, I will not go. it hurts me beyond measure, that I am forced to make
         these excuses, but go I can not, &amp; something must be said. these are cruel things!
      </p>
      <p>The family you mention near me are full as civil as ever; Miss Sp: seems to understand;
         &amp; to all such, as do not, she says <span style="font-style:italic">Φωναντα</span> <span style="font-style:italic">συνετοισι</span>  in so many words. and this is both my Motto &amp; Comment. I am afraid, you mistake
         Mr. Roper's complaisance for approbation. Dr. Brown (I hear) says, they are the best
         Odes in our language. Mr. Garrick, the best in ours, <span style="font-style:italic">or any other.</span> I should not write this immodest panegyrick, did not you guess at the motive of their
         applause. Ld Lyttelton &amp; Mr Shenstone admire, but wish they were a little clearer.
         Ld Barrington's explanation, I think, I told you before, so will not repeat it. Mr.
         Fox thinks, if the Bard sung his song but once over, King Edward could not possibly
         understand him. indeed I am of his opinion &amp; am certain, if he had sung it fifty times,
         it was impossible the King should know a jot the more about Edwd the 3d, &amp; Q: Elizabeth,
         &amp; Spencer, &amp; Milton, &amp;c: Mr Wood (Mr Pitt's Wood) is disappointed in his expectations.
         Dr. Akenside criticises opening <span style="font-style:italic">a source</span> with <span style="font-style:italic">a key.</span>  the Critical Review you have seen, or may see. he is in raptures (they say, it is
         Professor Franklin) but mistakes the Æolian lyre for the <span style="font-style:italic">Harp of Æolus,</span> &amp; on this mistake founds a compliment &amp; a criticism. this is, I think, all I have
         heard, that signifies.
      </p>
      <p>The Encyclopedie, I own, may cloy one, if one sets down to it. but you will own, that
         out of one great good dinner a number of little good dinners may be made, that would
         not cloy one at all. there is a long article sur <span style="font-style:italic">le Beau</span>  that for my life I can not understand. several of the geographical articles are
         carelessly done, &amp; some of the antiquities, or ancient history.
      </p>
      <p>My best Compliments to Mrs Wharton. I hope the operation going forward on your children
         will succeed to your wishes.
