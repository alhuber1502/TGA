      <p>I have been in Town at your house, &amp; left a note there for you: on my return hither
         I have received your second letter. on Monday I am going with the Cobhams<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to Hampton, &amp; propose to come from thence to Strawberry on Wednesday evening, or
         Thursday before dinner. I am sorry to hear of Mr C:s<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> illness: it is likely, he will not be able to go into the country; but if he does,
         I shall be glad to attend you thither, &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">back again,</span> if you will take that trouble upon you.</p>
