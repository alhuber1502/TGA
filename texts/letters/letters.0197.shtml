         Lie, &amp; told him, he knew the B:p was absolutely engaged to two People of Oxford, whom
         he named. then he drill'd<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> him on with various trifling pretences, &amp; at last went to town without ordaining
         him, or appointing any time, when he would. in the mean time V: being press'd by Letters
         from home, went to town &amp; was immediately ordain'd by the A:p of York,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; soon after appointed Chaplain. he was inform'd from a very sure hand, that all
         this time his friend of Ch:r<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> had been making interest for R–ss<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> against him, &amp; particularly had said, that V: could not have it, for he was a young
         man, <span style="font-style:italic">not in Orders</span> yet: I assure you, they are very angry (&amp; with reason), at R:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Castle; [ ] Birch, [ ] between great Fact [ ] of none: however it is to be read.
         [I am reading Mad:]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> de Maintenon's Letters; they are undoubtedly genuine. they begin very early in her
         Life, before she married Scarron;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; continue after the King's Death to within a little while of her own. they bear
         all the Marks of a noble Spirit, (in her adversity particularly) of Virtue, &amp; unaffected
         Devotion, insomuch that I am almost persuaded she indulged Lewis the 14th in no Liberties,
         till he actually married her, &amp; this not out of Policy &amp; Ambition, but Conscience;
         for she was what we should call a Bigot, yet with great good-sense. in short she was
         too good for a Court; Misfortunes in the beginning of her Life had form'd her Mind
         (naturally lively &amp; impatient) to reflexion, &amp; a habit of piety; she was always miserable,
         while she had the care of Mad: de Montespan's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> children; timid &amp; very cautious of making Use of that unlimited Power she rose to
         afterwards for fear of trespassing on the King's Friendship for her; &amp; after his death,
         not at all afraid of meeting her own. I don't know what to say to you with regard
         to Racine: it sounds to me as if any body should fall upon Shakespear, who indeed
         lies infinitely more open to Criticism of all kinds, but I should not care to be the
         person that undertook it. if you don't like Athaliah, or Britannicus, there is no
         more to be said. I have done.</p>
      <p>Ross bears, or dissembles his disappointment better, than I expected of him: perhaps
         indeed it may not turn out to his disadvantage at the end. he is in London about something.
         have you seen Bishop Hall's Satires, call'd Virgidemiæ, republish'd lately.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> they are full of spirit &amp; poetry; as much of the first, as Dr Donne,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; far more of the latter. they were wrote at this University, when he was about 23
         years old, in Q: Elizabeth's time.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
