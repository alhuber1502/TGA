         <p>The title-page will probably suffice you; but if you would know any more of him, he has read nothing but the common chronicles, and
					those without attention: for example, speaking of Anne the queen, he says, she was <hi rend="italic">barren,</hi> of which Richard had
					often complained to Rotheram. He extenuates the murder of Henry VI. and his son: the first, he says, might be a malicious accusation,
					for that many did suppose he died of mere melancholy and grief: the latter cannot be proved to be the action of Richard (though
					executed in his presence); and if it were, he did it out of love to his brother Edward. He justifies the death of the lords at Pomfret,
					from reasons of state, for his own preservation, the safety of the commonwealth, and the ancient nobility. The execution of Hastings he
					excuses from necessity, from the dishonesty and sensuality of the man: what was his crime with respect to Richard, he does not say. Dr.
					Shaw's sermon was not by the king's command, but to be imputed to the preacher's own ambition: but if
					it was by order, <hi rend="italic">to charge his mother with adultery was a matter of no such great moment, since it is no wonder in
						that sex.</hi> Of the murder in the Tower he doubts; but if it were by his order, the offence was to God, not to his people; and <hi rend="italic">how could he demonstrate his love more amply, than to venture his soul for their quiet?</hi> Have you enough, pray? You
					see it is an idle declamation, the exercise of a school-boy that is to be bred a statesman.</p>
         <p>I have looked in Stowe: to be sure there is no proclamation there. Mr. Hume, I suppose, means <hi rend="italic">Speed,</hi> where it is given, how truly I know not; but that he had seen the original is sure, and seems to quote the
					very words of it in the beginning of that speech which Perkin makes to James IV. and also just afterwards, where he treats of the
					Cornish rebellion.</p>
         <p>Guthrie, you see, has vented himself in the Critical Review. His History I never saw, nor is it
					here, nor do I know any one that ever saw it. He is a rascal, but rascals may chance to meet with curious records; and that commission
					to sir J. Tyrrell (if it be not a lye) is such: so is the order for Henry the sixth's funeral. I would
					by no means take notice of him, write what he would. I am glad you have seen the Manchester-roll.
				</p>
         <p>It is not I that talk of Phil. de Comines; it was mentioned to me as a thing that looked like a voluntary omission: but I see you
					have taken notice of it in the note to p. 71, though rather too slightly. You have not observed that
					the same writer says, c. 55, <hi rend="italic">Richard tua de sa main, ou fit tuer en sa presence, quelque lieu apart, ce bon homme le
						roi Henry.</hi> Another oversight I think there is at p. 43, where you speak of the <hi rend="italic">roll of parliament</hi> and the
					contract with lady Eleanor Boteler, as things newly come to light; whereas Speed has given at large
					the same roll in his History.</p>
