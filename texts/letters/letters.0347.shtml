         <div class="salute">My dear Sir, </div>
      </div>
      <p>I wonder whether you think me capable of all the gratitude I really feel for the late
         marks you have given me of your friendship, I will venture to say if you knew my heart
         you wou'd be content with it, but knowing my exterior so well as you do You can easily
         conceive me Vain of the Partiallity you show me; in return for puting me in good humour
         with myself I will give you pleasure by assuring you Lady Cobham is surprizingly well
         &amp; most extremely oblig'd to you for the Anxiety you express'd on her account.–we now
         take the Air ev'ry day and are returnd to our old way of living and hope we shall
         go on in the same way many Years.
      </p>
      <p>we are both scandaliz'd at your being in Town at this time of year, not because (as
         you may think) that it is unfashionable, but because we think it very unwholsome from
         the heat of the Season – now I know you are insensible to heat or cold, not but that
         your Body suffers by either extreme, but you have not attention enough to your self
         to seek a remedy, we beg now to point out one against the Excessive heat of London,
         by desiring you wou'd come down to Stoke where you will find Ev'ry thing cool but
         the reception we shall give you–there is always a Bed Air'd for you &amp; one for your
         Servt; indeed I can make use of the Strongest argument to tempt you which is that
         at this time it will be a deed of Charity as we are absolutely alone. Mrs Clavering
         and Mr Crane the Apothecary left us Yesterday, I dont know whether you are acquainted
         with the latter but I have such a partiallity from his attendance on Lady Cobham that
         I almost wish for a Slight fit of illness that I may have something to do with him
         – if you are at present an invalide let that prompt you to come, for from the <span style="font-style:italic">affected creature</span> you knew me, I am nothing now but a comfortable nurse –
      </p>
      <p>You sent me dreadfull News in regard to the K. of P. I now begin to fear for him,
         it was vastly good of you to Give us a detail of what passes in the World for few
         People will be at that trouble, indeed a certain Countess with whom I correspond does
         not Spare pains, but such news as she sends is not always to be depended on – I have
         kept her last Letter for your Entertainment;
      </p>
      <p>I am au desespoire about my friend L. G. S. and am sorry from different hands to hear
         that his narative is about as much in his favor as you seem to think his Letter to
         Co:l Fitzroy – I hope to talk all these matters over with you soon therefore shall
         add no more at present but that I am with great truth
      </p>
