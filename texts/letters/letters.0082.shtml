      <p>In my last I gave you the particulars of our little journey to Geneva: I have only
         to add, that we stayed about a week, in order to see Mr. Conway settled there: I do
         not wonder so many English choose it for their residence; the city is very small,
         neat, prettily built, and extremely populous; the Rhône runs through the middle of
         it, and it is surrounded with new fortifications, that give it a military compact
         air; which, joined to the happy, lively countenances of the inhabitants, and an exact
         discipline always as strictly observed as in time of war, makes the little republic
         appear a match for a much greater power; though perhaps Geneva, and all that belongs
         to it, are not of equal extent with Windsor and its two parks. To one that has passed
         through Savoy, as we did, nothing can be more striking than the contrast, as soon
         as he approaches the town. Near the gates of Geneva runs the torrent Arve, which separates
         it from the King of Sardinia's dominions; on the other side of it lies a country naturally,
         indeed, fine and fertile; but you meet with nothing in it but meager, ragged, bare-footed
         peasants, with their children, in extreme misery and nastiness; and even of these
         no great numbers: You no sooner have crossed the stream I have mentioned, but poverty
         is no more; not a beggar, hardly a discontented face to be seen; numerous, and well-dressed
         people swarming on the ramparts; drums beating, soldiers, well cloathed and armed,
         exercising; and folks, with business in their looks, hurrying to and fro; all contribute
         to make any person, who is not blind, sensible what a difference there is between
         the two governments, that are the causes of one view and the other. The beautiful
         lake, at one end of which the town is situated; its extent; the several states that
         border upon it; and all its pleasures, are too well known for me to mention them.
         We sailed upon it as far as the dominions of Geneva extend, that is, about two leagues
         and a half on each side; and landed at several of the little houses of pleasure, that
         the inhabitants have built all about it, who received us with much politeness. The
         same night we eat part of a trout, taken in the lake, that weighed thirty-seven pounds;
         as great a monster as it appeared to us, it was esteemed there nothing extraordinary,
         and they assured us, it was not uncommon to catch them of fifty pounds; they are dressed
         here, and sent post to Paris upon some great occasions; nay, even to Madrid, as we
         were told. The road we returned through was not the same we came by: We crossed the
         Rhône at Seyssel, and passed for three days among the mountains of Bugey, without
         meeting with any thing new: At last we came out into the plains of La Bresse, and
         so to Lyons again. Sir Robert has written to Mr. Walpole, to desire he would go to
         Italy; which he has resolved to do; so that all the scheme of spending the winter
         in the South of France is laid aside, and we are to pass it in a much finer country.
         You may imagine I am not sorry to have this opportunity of seeing the place in the
         world that best deserves it: Besides as the Pope (who is eighty-eight, and has been
         lately at the point of death) cannot probably last a great while, perhaps we may have
         the fortune to be present at the election of a new one, when Rome will be in all its
         glory. Friday next we certainly begin our journey; in two days we shall come to the
         foot of the Alps, and six more we shall be in passing them. Even here the winter is
         begun; what then must it be among those vast snowy mountains where it is hardly ever
         summer? We are, however, as well armed as possible against the cold, with muffs, hoods,
         and masks of bever, fur-boots, and bear skins. When we arrive at Turin, we shall rest
         after the fatigues of the journey. [...]
