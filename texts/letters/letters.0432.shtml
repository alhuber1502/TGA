      </div>
      <p>I rejoice. but has she common sense,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is she a Gentlewoman? has she money? has she a nose? I know, she sings a little,
         &amp; twiddles on the harpsichord, hammers at sentiment, &amp; puts herself in an attitude,
         admires a cast in the eye,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; can say Elfrida by heart: but these are only the virtues of a Maid. do, let her
         have some wifelike qualities, &amp; a double portion of prudence, as she will have not
         only herself to govern, but you also, &amp; that with an absolute sway. your Friends,
         I doubt not, will suffer for it: however we are very happy, &amp; have no other wish than
         to see you settled in the world. we beg you would not stand fiddleing about it, but
         be married forthwith, &amp; then take chaise, and come consummating all the way to Cambridge
         to be touch'd<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> by Mr Brown, &amp; so to London, where to be sure she must pass the first winter. if
         good reasons (&amp; not your own, nor her Coquetry) forbid this: yet come hither yourself,
         for our Copuses<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and Welch Rabbets are impatient for you.</p>
      <p><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have compared Helvetius &amp; Elfrida, and find thirteen parallel passages, five of
         which at least are so direct &amp; close, as to leave no shadow of a doubt, &amp; therefore
         confirm all the rest. it is a Phænomenon, that you will be in the right to inform
         yourself about, &amp; that I long to understand. another Phænomenon is, that I read it
         without finding it out. All I remember is, that I thought it not at all <span style="font-style:italic">English,</span> &amp; did not much like it; and the reason is plain; for the lyric flights &amp; choral flowers
         suited not at all with the circumstances or character, as he had contrived it.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I sent your letter to Algarotti<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> directly. my <span style="font-style:italic">Coserelle</span> came a long while ago: from Mr Holles,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I suppose; who sent me (without a name), a set of his engravings, when I was last
         in Town, wch (I reckon) is what you mean by your fine presents. the <span style="font-style:italic">Congresso di Citera</span> was not one of the books: that was my mistake.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I like his treatises very well.</p>
      <p>I hope in God the dedicatorial Sonnet<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has not staid for me. I object nothing to the 2d line, but like it the better for
         Milton, and with him I would read in penult: (give me a shilling) <span style="font-style:italic">his ghastly smile,</span> &amp;c.:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but if you won't put it in, then read <span style="font-style:italic">wonted</span> smile, &amp; a little before <span style="font-style:italic">secure from envy.</span> I see nothing to alter. what I said was the best line is the best line still. do
         come hither, &amp; I will read and criticize</p>
