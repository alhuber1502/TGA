         <div class="salute">Dear Sr,</div>
      </div>
      <p>I hope in God it is your Uncle, or his Son (for News-Papers are apt to confound ye)
         but from the Circumstances I fear it must be you, that have had so very narrow an
         Escape from Death. excuse me, if I am sollicitous to know how you are after such a
         Surprise; &amp; whether you have really met with no considerable Hurt from this Accident.
         or was it an Accident, &amp; did they only mean to rob you?
      </p>
      <p>I sincerely rejoice at your Deliverance, &amp; hope soon to tell you so in Town; but in
         the mean time should be glad to know from yourself how it happen'd; &amp; how it feels,
         when one returns back from the very Brink of Destruction. believe me, my dear Sr,
         ever 
      </p>
