         <div class="salute">Dear Sr,</div>
      </div>
      <p>I hope in God it is your Uncle,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or his Son<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (for News-Papers are apt to confound ye) but from the Circumstances I fear it must
         be you, that have had so very narrow an Escape from Death. excuse me, if I am sollicitous
         to know how you are after such a Surprise; &amp; whether you have really met with no considerable
         Hurt from this Accident. or was it an Accident, &amp; did they only mean to rob you?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I sincerely rejoice at your Deliverance, &amp; hope soon to tell you so in Town; but in
         the mean time should be glad to know from yourself how it happen'd; &amp; how it feels,
         when one returns back from the very Brink of Destruction. believe me, my dear Sr,
         ever 
      </p>
