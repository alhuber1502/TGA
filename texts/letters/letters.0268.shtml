         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>If I did not immediately answer your kind enquiry, you will attribute it to the visit,
         wch I was obliged to do the honours of for two or three days, &amp; wch is now over. I
         find nothing new to add to my uneasiness here; on the contrary it is considerably
         abated, &amp; quiet, I hope, is gradually returning.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I am extremely glad to hear your country residence<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> promises so well, &amp; has been so serviceable to Mrs. Wharton already.</p>
      <p>You desire to know how I like my visit. Lord N:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is a sensible well-bred young Man, a little too fine even for me, who love a little
         finery: he never will be popular, &amp; it is well, if he be not very much hated. his
         party were Lord Villers,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Mr Spencer,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but I did not see a great deal of them. Ld John<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been with me all this morning. the D: of Bedford<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is now here to settle his Son<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at Trinity, &amp; Mr Rigby<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is come to assist him with his advice.</p>
