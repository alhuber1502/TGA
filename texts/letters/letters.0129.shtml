         <div class="salute">My dear Ashton,</div>
      </div>
      <p>This melancholy day is the first that I have had any notice of my Loss in poor West,
         and that only by so unexpected a Means as some Verses publishd in a Newspaper (they
         are fine &amp; true &amp; I believe may be your own).<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I had indeed some reason to suspect it some days since from receiving a letter of
         my own<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to him sent back unopen'd. The stupid People had put it no Cover, nor thought it
         worth while to write one Line to inform me of the reason, tho' by knowing how to direct,
         they must imagine I was his friend. I am a fool indeed to be surprizd at meeting with
         Brutishness or want of Thought among Mankind; what I would desire is, that you would
         have the goodness to tell me, what you know of his death, more particularly as soon
         as you have any Leisure; my own Sorrow does not make me insensible to your new Happiness,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which I heartily congratulate you upon, as the means of Quiet, and Independence,
         &amp; the Power of expressing your benevolence to those you love. neither my Misfortune,
         nor my joy shall detain you longer at a time, when doubtless you are a good deal employd;
         only believe me sincerely yours
      </p>

         <p>P.S. Pray do not forget my impatience, – especially if you do not happen to be in
            London. I have no one to enquire of but yourself. 'tis now three weeks, that I have
            been in the Country, but shall return to Town in 2 days.
