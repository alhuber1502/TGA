         <p>It feels to me as if it were a long while, since I heard from you. not a word to flatter or to abash the vanity of an Author! suffer
					me then to tell you, that I hear, we are not at all popular. the great objection is obscurity, no body knows what we would be at. one
					Man (a Peer) I have been told of, that thinks the last Stanza of the 2d Ode relates to Charles the
					first &amp; Oliver Cromwell. in short the <hi rend="italic">Î£Ï&#x85;Î½ÎµÏ&#x84;Î¿á½·</hi>
					 appear to be still fewer, than even I expected.</p>
         <p>You will imagine all this does not go very deep; but I have been almost eversince I was here exceedingly dispirited, besides being
					really ill in body. no gout, but something feverish, that seems to come almost every morning, &amp; disperses soon after I am up. the
						Cobhams are here, &amp; as civil as usual. Garrick &amp; his Wife have been down with them some days,
					&amp; are soon to come again. except the little amusement they give me, &amp; two volumes of the Encyclopedie now almost exhausted, I have nothing but my own thoughts to feed upon, &amp; you know they are of the gloomy
					cast. write to me then for <hi rend="italic">sweet St Charity,</hi>
					 &amp; remember, that while I am my own, I am most faithfully</p>
