         <div class="salute">My dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>You seem to forget me: if it were for any other reason, than that you are very busy,
         that is, very happy, I should not so easily pass it over.</p>
      <p>I send you a Swedish &amp; English Calendar. the first Column is by Berger,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a Disciple of LinnÃ¦us;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the 2d by Mr Stillingfleet,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the 3d (very imperfect indeed) by me. you are to observe, as you tend your plantations
         &amp; take your walks, how the Spring advances in the North, &amp; whether Old-Park most resembles
         Upsal, or Stratton.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> this latter has on one side a barren black heath, on the other a light sandy loam;
         all the country about it is a dead flat. you see, it is necessary you should know
         the situation (I do not mean any reflection upon any body's place) &amp; this is Mr. Stillingfleet's
         description of his Friend Mr Marsham's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Seat, to wch in summer he retires, &amp; botanizes. I have lately made an acquaintance
         with this Philosopher, who lives in a garret here in the winter, that he may support
         some near relations, who depend upon him. he is always employ'd, &amp; always chearful,
         &amp; seems to me a very worthy honest Man. his present scheme is to send some Persons
         properly qualified to reside a year or two in Attica to make themselves acquainted
         with the climate, productions, &amp; natural history of the country, that we may understand
         Aristotle &amp; Theophrastus,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c: who have been heathen-Greek to us for so many ages. this he has got proposed
         to Ld Bute, who is no unlikely Person to put it in execution, being himself a Botanist,
         &amp; having now in the press a new System of Botany of his own writing in several volumes,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the profits of wch he gives to Dr Hill<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (the Inspector) who has lately got the place of Master-Gardiner at Kensington, reckon'd
         worth near 2000Â£ a-year. there is an odd thing for you!</p>
      <p>One hears nothing of the K:,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but what gives one the best opinion of him imaginable: I hope, it may hold. the R:
         F:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> run loose about the world, &amp; people do not know how to treat them, nor they how to
         be treated. they visit &amp; are visited: some come to the Street-door to receive them,
         &amp; that, they say, is too much: others to the head of the stairs, &amp; that they think
         too little. no body sits down with them, not even in their own house, unless at a
         card-table, so the world are like to grow very weary of the honour. none but the D:
         of Y:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> enjoy themselves (you know, he always did) but the world seems weary of this honour
         too, for a different reason. I have just heard no bad story of him. when he was at
         Southampton in the summer, there was a Clergyman in the neighbourhood with two very
         handsome daughters. he had soon wind of them, &amp; drop'd in for some reason or other,
         came again &amp; again, &amp; grew familiar enough to eat a bone of their mutton. at last
         he said to the Father, Miss â&#x80;&#x94; lead a mighty confined life here always at home, why
         can't you let one of them go, &amp; take an airing now and then with me in my chaise?
         Ah! Sr (says the Parson) do but look at them, a couple of hale fresh-colour'd hearty
         Wenches! they need no airing, they are well-enough: but there is their Mother, poor
         Woman, has been in a declining way many years. if your R: H: would give her an airing
         now &amp; then, it would be doing us a great kindness indeed!</p>
      <p>You see, old Wortley-Montagu<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is dead at last at 83. it was not mere avarice, &amp; its companion, abstinence, that
         kept him alive so long. he every day drank (I think, it was) half a pint of Tokay,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch he imported himself from Hungary in greater quantity than he could use, &amp; sold
         the Overplus for any price he chose to set upon it. he has left better than half a
         million of money: to Lady Mary 1200Â£ a-year, in case she gives up her pretensions
         to dowry; &amp; if not, it comes to his Son.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to the same Son 1000Â£ per an: for life only,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; after him to his Daughter, Lady Bute. (now this Son is about 80,000Â£ in debt)
         to all Lady Bute's Children, which are eleven, 2000Â£ a-piece. <span style="font-style:italic">all the remainder</span> to Lady Bute, &amp; after her to her second Son,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who takes the name of Wortley, &amp; (if he fail) to the next in order; &amp; after all these
         &amp; their Children to Ld Sandwich,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to whom <span style="font-style:italic">in present</span> he leaves some old Manuscripts. now I must tell you a story of Lady Mary. as she
         was on her travels, she had occasion to go somewhere by sea, &amp; (to save charges) got
         a passage on board a Man of War: the ship was (I think) Commodore Barnet's.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when he had landed her, she told him, she knew she was not to offer to pay for her
         passage, but in consideration of his many civilities entreated him to wear a ring
         for her sake, &amp; press'd him to accept it, wch he did. it was an emerald of remarkable
         size &amp; beauty. some time after, as he wore it, some Friend was admiring it, &amp; asking
         how he came by it. when he heard from whom it came, he laugh'd &amp; desired him to shew
         it to a Jeweller, whom he knew. the Man was sent for: he unset it; it was a paste
         not worth 40 shillings.</p>
      <p>The Ministry are much out of joint. Mr P:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> much out of humour, his popularity tottering, chiefly occasion'd by a Pamphlet against
         the German War, written by that <span style="font-style:italic">squeaking</span> acquaintance of ours, Mr. Mauduit:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it has had a vast run. the Irish are very intractable, even the Lds J:s themselves;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> great difficulties about who shall be sent over to tame them: my Ld H:ss<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> again named, but (I am told) has refused it. every body waits for a new Parliament
         to settle their ideas.</p>
      <p>I have had no gout, since you went: I will not brag, lest it return with redoubled
         violence. I am very foolish, &amp; do nothing to mark, that I ever was: I am going to
         C:ge<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to take the <span style="font-style:italic">fresh air</span> this fine winter for a month or so. we have had snow one day this winter, but it
         did not lie: it was several months ago. the 18th of Jan: I took a walk to <span style="font-style:italic">Kentish-Town,</span> wind N: W:, bright &amp; frosty. Therm: at Noon was at 42. the grass remarkably green
         &amp; flourishing. I observed, on dry banks facing the South that Chickweed, Dandelion,
         Groundsel, Red Archangel,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Shepherds-Purse were beginning to flower. this is all I know of the Country.</p>
      <p>My best compliments to Mrs Wharton. I hear her butter is the best in the Bishoprick,
         &amp; that even Deborah<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has learn'd to spin. I rejoice you are all in health, but why are you deaf: &amp; blind
         too, or you could not vote for F: V:!<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have abundance more to say, but my paper won't hear of it.</p>

         <p>Observe, from this Calendar it appears, that there is a wonderful difference between
            the earlier PhÃ¦nomena of the Spring in Sweden &amp; in England, no less than 78 days
            in the flow'ring of the Snow-Drop, 61 days in the appearance of the Wagtail, 62 days
            in the bloom of the Lilac, 43 days in the leafing of the Oak, 40 days in the blooming
            of the Cherry-tree, 36 days in the singing of the Nightingale, 33 in the return of
            the Swallow, 25 in that of the Cuckow, &amp; so on. yet the Summer-flowers nearly keep
            time alike in both climates, the Harvest differs not a fortnight, some of the Fruits
            only 9 days; nay, strawberries come earlier there by 13 days, than with us. the Swallow
            stays with us only 4 days longer than with them, &amp; the Ashtree begins to lose its
            leaves within 3 days of the same time. these differences, &amp; these uniformities I know
            not how to account for. </p>
         <p>Mr Stillingfleet's Kalendar goes no farther than Oct: 26. but I observed, that, on
            Dec: 2, many of our Rosetrees had put out new leaves, and the Laurustine, Polyanthus,
            single yellow, &amp; bloody Wallflowers, Cytisus, &amp; scarlet Geranium were still in flower.
            </p>
         <p>Jan: 15. 1756. the Honeysuckles were in leaf, and single Hepatica &amp; Snowdrop in flower.
            </p>
         <p>As to the noise of Birds, Mr St: marks their times thus in Norfolk. </p>
