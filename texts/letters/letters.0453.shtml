      <p>My instructions, of which you are so desirous, are two-fold: the first part relates
         to what is past, and that will be rather diffuse: the second, to what is to come;
         and that we shall treat more succinctly, and with all due brevity.
      </p>
      <p>First, when you come to Paris you will not fail to visit the cloister of the Chartreuse,
         where Le Sueur (in the history of St. Bruno) has almost equalled Raphael. Then your
         Gothic inclinations will naturally lead you to the Sainte Chapelle built by St. Louis:
         in the treasury is preserved one of the noblest gems of the Augustan age. When you
         take a trip into the country, there is a fine old chapel at Vincennes with admirable
         painted windows; and at Fontainbleau, the remains of Francis the First's magnificence
         might give you some pleasure. In your way to Lyons you will take notice of the view
         over the Saone, from about Tournus and Macon. Fail not to walk a few miles along the
         banks of the Rhone, down the river. I would certainly make a little journey to the
         Grande Chartreuse, up the mountains: at your return out of Italy this will have little
         effect. At Turin you will visit the Capuchins' convent just without the city, and
         the Superga at no great distance, for the sake of the views. At Genoa observe the
         Terreno of the Palace Brignoli, as a model of an apartment elegantly disposed in a
         hot climate. At Parma you will adore the great Madonna and St. Jerom, once at St.
         Antonio Abbate, but now (I am told) in the Ducal Palace. In the Madonna della Steccata
         observe the Moses breaking the tables, a chiaroscuro figure of the Parmeggiano at
         too great a height, and ill lighted, but immense. At the Capuchins, the great Pietá
         of Annib. Caracci; in the Villa Ducale, the room painted by Carlo Cignani; and the
         last works of Agostino Caracci at Modena. I know not what remains now, the flower
         of the collection is gone to Dresden. Bologna is too vast a subject for me to treat:
         the palaces and churches are open; you have nothing to do but to see them all. In
         coming down the Apennine you will see (if the sun shines) all Tuscany before you.
         And so I have brought you to Florence, where to be sure there is nothing worth seeing.
         Secondly,

         <li class="item">6. Eme, quodcunque emendum est; I do not mean pictures, medals, gems, drawings, &amp;c.,
            only; but clothes, stockings, shoes, handkerchiefs, little moveables; every thing
            you may want all your life long: but have a care of the custom house. 
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pray present my most respectful compliments to Mr. Weddell. I conclude when the winter
         is over, and you have seen Rome and Naples, you will strike out of the beaten path
         of English travellers, and see a little of the country, throw yourselves into the
         bosom of the Appennine, survey the horrid lake of Amsanctus (look in Cluver's Italy),
         catch the breezes on the coast of Taranto and Salerno, expatiate to the very toe of
         the continent, perhaps strike over the Faro of Messina, and having measured the gigantic
         columns of Girgenti, and the tremendous caverns of Syracusa, refresh yourselves amidst
         the fragrant vale of Enna. Oh! che bel riposo!
