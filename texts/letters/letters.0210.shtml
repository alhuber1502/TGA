         <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Gray,</div>
      </div>
      <p>You have been rightly informd that I have lost a most affectionate Father. I have
         felt for him, all that a heart not naturally hard, &amp; at the time already softend by
         preceeding anxiety could feel. But my Greiss rest not on him alone, only last tuesday
         my most intimate friend Dr Pricket<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> followd him, a Man who I assure you had more good Qualities of the Heart, than the
         brightest of the Head could outballance either in mine or your estimation, we were
         brought up together from infancy &amp; ever livd in the sincerest affection; in my long
         illness at London he attended me with a Care and assiduity almost unparralelld. I
         endeavord to repay that Care in my turn but alas his Fate did not give me time to
         discharge half the debt, yet what I could, I did.</p>
      <p>O Mr Gray how dreadful is it to sit besides a Dying Friend! to see as I did, reason
         withdraw herself gradually, often return by starts, to a Memory evry Minute less capable
         of furnishing her with Ideas, and a tongue less able to give them utterance. I talk
         nonsence I beleive, but let me do it, it gives me some relief, what makes his Loss
         to me more deplorable is, that I am afraid either the Physician who constantly attended
         him mistook his Case, or that the other who was calld in afterwards hastend his End,
         for a sudden change ensued the alteration of his medicines. But I will check myself
         till I see you and then you must bear with me, if I am even a Child or a Woman in
         my complainings. I must add however that in a Will he made five year ago his Friendship
         bequeathd to me two hundred pounds wch when my Debt is dischargd to his executor will
         be reducd to one, yet the sum will come at present as oportunly as any thing of the
         kind possibly could, as My Father by the Strangest disposition of his affairs that
         can be conceivd has left all my paternal estate to my Mother in Law<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for her life and entaild it so on my little sister, that I can take up no Money upon
         it, so that without this Legacy I should not have had a Shilling at present. I beleive
         I shall be obligd to take a journey to Mr. Huttons<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> near Richmond and may perhaps be at York next sunday,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but this is so exceedingly uncertain that I only just name it but would not have
         you alter your schemes upon it for the sake of a meeting. Because my Mother is at
         present in a fever with three blisters but I hope on the recovery, yet I cannot leave
         her till there appears a greater certainty. Tom<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been also in a feavor and got out only to day, therefore I dont know whether
         he'll be in a condition to travel, and I cant easily relinquish the pomp of travelling
         with a Servt all on a sudden; and my Father's Servt, a Lad of the same age, died the
         week after his Master of a Fever also. from all this you may guess what a time I have
         gone thro lately. yet I am well myself at present except that my hands tremble, and
         my spiritts often, very often sink. yet have they supported me hitherto supprizingly.
         Pray tell Mr Brown when you see him that I fear I cannot be up at College by the tenth
         of October,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> yet I shall get there as soon as ever I can make any end of my perplext [affairs]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> here. I wish you had told me how long you would stay in Buckinghamshire I hope it
         will be short, and that we may meet again at Cambridge soon. adieu. My best complmts
         to Dr Wharton.</p>
