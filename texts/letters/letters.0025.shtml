         <p>Third in the labours of the Disc came on, <br /> With sturdy step and slow, Hippomedon; <br /> Artful and strong he pois'd the well-known weight, <br /> By Phlegyas warn'd, and fir'd by Mnestheus' fate, <br /> That to avoid, and this to emulate. <br /> His vigorous arm he try'd before he flung, <br /> Brac'd all his nerves, and every sinew strung; <br /> Then with a tempest's whirl and wary eye, <br /> Pursu'd his cast, and hurl'd the orb on high; <br /> The orb on high tenacious of its course, <br /> True to the mighty arm that gave it force, <br /> Far overleaps all bound, and joys to see <br /> Its antient lord secure of victory. <br /> The theatre's green height and woody wall <br /> Tremble ere it precipitates its fall, <br /> The ponderous mass sinks in the cleaving ground, <br /> While vales and woods and echoing hills rebound. <br /> As when from Ãƒ&#x86;tna's smoaking summit broke, <br /> The eyeless Cyclops heav'd the craggy rock; <br /> Where Ocean frets beneath the dashing oar, <br /> And parting surges round the vessel roar; <br /> 'Twas there he aim'd the meditated harm, <br /> And scarce Ulysses scap'd his giant arm. <br /> A tyger's pride the victor bore away, <br /> With native spots and artful labour gay, <br /> A Shining border round the margin roll'd, <br /> And calm'd the terrors of his claws in gold.</p>
