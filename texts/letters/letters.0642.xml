				     <p>I am glad to hear from Molly today, that there is no particular charge against you in your office,
					for if it is only the greediness of the Corporation, I will think it will be easily disappointed, the
					assurance Mr Shelvocke has given you, that you are secure weighs much with me: so much, that I doubt
					it was hardly necessary to speak to Ld Besborough on that head, for to petition before one is accused
					of any thing, may appear as if we were conscious of having done somewhat amiss: however my Letter is gone, &amp; can not be recalled,
					if it is unne[cessary] so much the better.</p>
				     <p>I believe &amp; hope, you may continue ve[ry sure] on this head. let it only caution you to see the bus[iness] of your office
					diligently executed, &amp; to avoid even the least occasion of complaint, and then you have little to fear. </p>

					       <salute>I am Madm, <lb/>

				        <p>My love to the Girls. pray tell Molly, I expect to <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> from her again soon.
					she must direct At Mr Jauncey's in Southampton Row, Bloomsbury.</p>
