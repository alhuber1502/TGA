         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I intend to return you the letters by tomorrow's Fly, if nothing hinders. I am never
         the wiser, nor the more able to account for T:s letter to Lady L: (wch gave occasion
         to all the rest) it still looks like the suggestion of his Wife working upon his own
         natural irritability, &amp; the sort of request made in it for the Berwick-living (at
         so improper a time) is not any other way to be accounted for. the <span style="font-style:italic">sensible &amp; manly</span> answer to it (I must own) I can not easily digest, especially the end of it: it is
         plain, as he wrote on, he work'd his temper into a ferment, till at last it absolutely
         turn'd sower. I can not help his temper, but his heart may (for all that) be right.
         in the second letter he is conscious, he had gone too far in his expressions, &amp; tries
         to give them a sense they will not bear: but I allow he is throughout too angry &amp;
         too contemptuous. your last letter to him (tho' I never saw it) I conclude has done
         no hurt, perhaps has softened him a little. every thing depends upon the manner of
         their meeting in Devonshire, wch by this time you probably know. I do not yet see,
         why all this passion, why all this trouble of justifying himself to a Man, for whom
         he never had any kindness or regard, &amp; who can be of little use to him in point of
         interest. Temp: is too precipitate, too rough too in his expressions, too much the
         aggressor, if he thinks Ld L: really his Friend; and if he does not, how in the midst
         of his resentment can he bring himself to shew a desire of accepting farther favours
         from him? I yet have some little hope, that all may come right again, at least right
         enough for our purpose; for I am more convinced of T:s contempt &amp; want of esteem for
         L:, than I am of L:s aversion, or neglect of T:.

      <p>Mason is here with us, &amp; will stay (I should hope) some time: he is even going to
         hire a small house opposite to Peter-house, wch he can not inhabit till next winter.
         Mr. Hutton being dead, he has now a landed estate, the income of which in a few years
         will be considerable.

      <p>old Smith of Trinity is dead, &amp; Dr Hinchliffe will probably succeed him, tho' Dr Ross
         &amp; Brocket are also Competitors for it. are your India-paper, your Axminster-carpets,
         your Sofas &amp; Pech√©s-mortels, in great forwardness? have you read Mr. Anstey, &amp; the
         Historical doubts?
