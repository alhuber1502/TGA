						Dear S<hi rend="super">r</hi>
					       </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>        I received M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Talbot's letter from Bath, &amp; hear today, that he is return'd to
				Cambridge. I should write to him, had I anything worth his notice, that I could tell him in a letter. I hope, he continues to feel the
				good effects of his journey.<lb/>         You probably know as well as I do, that the M: of Rockingham has given a
				considerable living, Keeton (I think, is its name) in Huntingd:<hi rend="super">n[s?]</hi> worth near 300£ a-year, tenable with his
				Mastership, to the V: Chancellour.  it is just under the nose of Hinchinbroke &amp; Kimbolton, &amp; comes very a-propos in all respects.
				I desire to know the policy of Trinity-Hall. there are 10 fellows (not insane) that elect, and I hear 5, if not 6, of them are
				Candidates for the Mastership, among w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> Mat. Robinson is one. D<hi rend="super">r</hi> Calvert (I hear) has got
				the Chancellorship of Worcester.</p>
				     <p>         I am sorry to tell you, that the tragical story of the Prisoners in India,  with those sad circumstances
				you saw in the Papers comes from M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Pigot lately return'd from thence. it is true, he had his intelligence from a
				Black Native of the Country concerning their fate: but it is generally believed here. Clive embarks on Tuesday.<lb/>    
				    You will oblige me in sending Sally's account (I mean the sum total) as soon as you are able, for I know not how soon I
				shall leave London. Nicholls tells me, you are well, &amp; walk to Ditton.</p>
			      <closer>
				        <salute> Adieu! I am sincerely <lb/>Yours.
