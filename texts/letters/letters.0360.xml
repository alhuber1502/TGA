					       <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>First &amp; foremost pray take notice of the Paper, on wch I am writing to you: it is the first, that ever was made of silk-rags,
					upon the encouragement given by your Society of Arts; &amp; (if this were all the fruits) I think you
					need not regret your two Guineas a-year. the colour &amp; texture you see; &amp; besides I am told, it will not burn (at least will not
					flame) like ordinary paper, so that it may be of great use for hanging rooms. it is uncommonly tough, &amp; tho' very thin, you
					observe, is not transparent. here is another sort of it intended for the uses of Drawing. </p>
				     <p>You have lately had a visit, where you are, that I am sure bodes no good, especially just at the
					time that the D: of C:y, &amp; Mr Blacowe died. we attribute it to
					a <hi rend="italic">Miff</hi> about the Garter, &amp; some other humps &amp; grumps, that he has received. alas! I fear, it will never do. the Conde de Fuentes was much at a loss, &amp; had like to have made a quarrel of it, that he had no body but the D: of N: to introduce him: but Miss Chudleigh has appeased him with a Ball.</p>
				     <p>I have sent Mus√¶us to Mr Fraser, scratched here &amp; there;
					&amp; with it I desired him to inclose a bloody Satyr, written against no less Persons than you &amp; me by name. I concluded at first it was Mr Pottinger, because he is your Friend &amp;
					my humble Servant; but then I thought he knew the World too well to call us the favorite Minions of Taste, &amp; of Fashion, especially as to Odes, for to them his abuse is confined. so it is not Secretary
					Pottinger, but Mr Coleman, nephew to my Lady Bath, Author of the Connoisseur, a Member of some of the
					Inns of Court, &amp; a particular Acquaintance of Mr Garrick. what have you done to him? for I never heard his name before. he makes
					very tolerable fun with me, where I understand him (wch is not every where) but seems more angry with you. least People should not
					understand the humour of the thing (wch indeed to do, they must have our Lyricisms at their finger's ends) he writes letters in Lloyd's
					Evening Post to tell them, who &amp; what it was, that he meant; &amp; says, that it is like to
					produce a <hi rend="italic">great combustion</hi> in the Literary World: so if you have any mind to <hi rend="italic">combustle</hi>
					about it, well &amp; good! for me I am neither so literary, nor so combustible.</p>
				     <p>I am going into Oxfordshire for a fortnight to a place near Henley, &amp; then to Cambridge, if
					that Owl Phobus does not hinder me, who talks of going to fizzle there at the Commencement.
				</p>
				     <p>What do you say to Ld Lyttelton (your old Patron), &amp; Mrs
						Montagu, with their second-hand Dialogues of the Dead? &amp; then
					there is your Friend, the little black Man. he has wrote one supplemental Dialogue, but I did not read it.</p>
				     <p>Do tell me of your health, your doings, your designs, &amp; your golden dreams, and try to love me a little better in Yorkshire than
					you did in Middlesex, for I am ever </p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Yours</salute>
