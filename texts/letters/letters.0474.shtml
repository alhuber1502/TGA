         <div class="dateline">Paris, January 25, 1766. </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am much indebted to you for your kind letter and advice; and though it is late to
         thank you for it, it is at least a stronger proof that I do not forget it. However,
         I am a little obstinate, as you know, on the chapter of health, and have persisted
         through this Siberian winter in not adding a grain to my clothes, and in going open-breasted
         without an under-waistcoat. In short, though I like extremely to live, it must be
         in my own way, as long as I can: it is not youth I court, but liberty; and I think
         making one's self tender, is issuing a <span style="font-style:italic">general warrant</span> against one's own person. I suppose I shall submit to confinement, when I cannot
         help it; but I am indifferent enough to life not to care if it ends soon after my
         prison begins.</p>
      <p>I have not delayed so long to answer your letter, from not thinking of it, or from
         want of matter, but from want of time. I am constantly occupied, engaged, amused,
         till I cannot bring a hundredth part of what I have to say into the compass of a letter.
         You will lose nothing by this: you know my volubility, when I am full of new subjects;
         and I have at least many hours of conversation for you at my return. One does not
         learn a whole nation in four or five months; but, for the time, few, I believe, have
         seen, studied, or got so much acquainted with the French as I have. </p>
      <p>By what I said of their religious or rather irreligious opinions, you must not conclude
         their people of quality, atheistsâ&#x80;&#x93;at least not the menâ&#x80;&#x93;Happily for them, poor
         souls! they are not capable of going so far into thinking. They assent to a great
         deal, because it is the fashion, and because they don't know how to contradict. They
         are ashamed to defend the Roman catholic religion, because it is quite exploded; but
         I am convinced they believe it in their hearts. They hate the parliaments and the
         philosophers, and are rejoiced that they may still idolize royalty. At present too
         they are a little triumphant: the court has shown a little spirit, and the parliaments
         much less: but as the duc de Choiseul,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who is very fluttering, unsettled, and inclined to the philosophers, has made a compromise
         with the parliament of Bretagne, the parliaments might venture out again, if, as I
         fancy will be the case, they are not glad to drop a cause, of which they began to
         be a little weary of the inconveniences.</p>
      <p>The generality of the men, and more than the generality, are dull and empty. They
         have taken up gravity, thinking it was philosophy and English, and so have acquired
         nothing in the room of their natural levity and cheerfulness. However, as their high
         opinion of their own country remains, for which they can no longer assign any reason,
         they are contemptuous and reserved, instead of being ridiculously, consequently pardonably,
         impertinent. I have wondered, knowing my own countrymen, that we had attained such
         a superiority.â&#x80;&#x93;I wonder no longer, and have a little more respect for English <span style="font-style:italic">heads</span> than I had.</p>
      <p>The women do not seem of the same country: if they are less gay than they were, they
         are more informed, enough to make them very conversable. I know six or seven with
         very superior understandings; some of them with wit, or with softness, or very good
         sense. </p>
      <p>Madame Geoffrin,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of whom you have heard much, is an extraordinary woman, with more common sense than
         I almost ever met with. Great quickness in discovering characters, penetration in
         going to the bottom of them, and a pencil that never fails in a likenessâ&#x80;&#x93;seldom
         a favourable one. She exacts and preserves, spite of her birth and their nonsensical
         prejudices about nobility, great court and attention. This she acquires by a thousand
         little arts and offices of friendship; and by a freedom and severity, which seems
         to be her sole end of drawing a concourse to her; for she insists on scolding those
         she inveigles to her. She has little taste and less knowledge, but protects artisans<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and authors, and courts a few people to have the credit of serving her dependents.
         She was bred under the famous madame Tencin,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who advised her never to refuse any man; for, said her mistress, though nine in ten
         should not care a farthing for you, the tenth may live to be an useful friend. She
         did not adopt or reject the whole plan, but fully retained the purport of the maxim.
         In short, she is an epitome of empire, subsisting by rewards and punishments. Her
         great enemy, madame du Deffand,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was for a short time mistress of the regent, is now very old and stone blind, but
         retains all her vivacity, wit, memory, judgment, passions, and agreeableness. She
         goes to operas, plays, suppers, and Versailles; gives suppers twice a week; has every
         thing new read to her; makes new songs and epigrams, aye, admirably, and remembers
         every one that has been made these fourscore years. She corresponds with Voltaire,
         dictates charming letters to him, contradicts him, is no bigot to him or any body,
         and laughs both at the clergy and the philosophers. In a dispute, into which she easily
         falls, she is very warm, and yet scarce ever in the wrong: her judgment on every subject
         is as just as possible; on every point of conduct as wrong as possible: for she is
         all love and hatred, passionate for her friends to enthusiasm, still anxious to be
         loved, I don't mean by lovers, and a vehement enemy, but openly. As she can have no
         amusement but conversation, the least solitude and ennui are insupportable to her,
         and put her into the power of several worthless people, who eat her suppers when they
         can eat nobody's of higher rank; wink to one another and laugh at her; hate her because
         she has forty times more partsâ&#x80;&#x93;and venture to hate her because she is not rich.
         She has an old friend whom I must mention, a monsieur Pondevelle,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> author of the Fat Puni, and the Complaisant, and of those pretty novels, the Comte
         de Cominge, the Siege of Calais, and les Malheurs de l'Amour. Would not you expect
         this old man to be very agreeable? He can be so, but seldom is: yet he has another
         very different and very amusing talent, the art of parody, and is unique in his kind.
         He composes tales to the tunes of long dances: for instance, he has adapted the Regent's
         Daphnis and Chloe to one, and made it ten times more indecent; but is so old and sings
         it so well, that it is permitted in all companies. He has succeeded still better in
         les characteres de la danse, to which he has adapted words that express all the characters
         of love. With all this, he has not the least idea of cheerfulness in conversation;
         seldom speaks but on grave subjects, and not often on them; is a humourist, very supercilious,
         and wrapt up in admiration of his own country, as the only judge of his merit. His
         air and look are cold and forbidding; but ask him to sing, or praise his works, his
         eyes and smiles open and brighten up. In short, I can show him to you: the self-applauding
         poet in Hogarth's Rake's Progress, the second print, is so like his very features
         and very wig, that you would know him by it, if you came hitherâ&#x80;&#x93;for he certainly
         will not go to you.</p>
      <p>Madame de Mirepoix's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> understanding is excellent of the useful kind, and can be so when she pleases of
         the agreeable kind. She has read, but seldom shows it, and has perfect taste. Her
         manner is cold, but very civil; and she conceals even the blood of Lorrain, without
         ever forgetting it. Nobody in France knows the world better, and nobody is personally
         so well with the king. She is false, artful, and insinuating beyond measure when it
         is her interest, but indolent and a coward. She never had any passion but gaming,
         and always loses. For ever paying court, the sole produce of a life of art is to get
         money from the king to carry on a course of paying debts or contracting new ones,
         which she discharges as fast as she is able. She advertised devotion to get made dame
         du palais to the queen; and the very next day this princess of Lorrain was seen riding
         backwards with madame Pompadour in the latter's coach. When the king was stabbed and
         heartily frightened, the mistress took a panic too, and consulted d'Argenson,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whether she had not best make off in time. He hated her, and said, By all means.
         Madame de Mirepoix advised her to stay. The king recovered his spirits, d'Argenson
         was banished, and la marechale inherited part of the mistress's credit.â&#x80;&#x93;I must interrupt
         my history of illustrious women with an anecdote of monsieur de Maurepas,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with whom I am much acquainted, and who has one of the few heads that approach to
         good ones, and who luckily for us was disgraced, and the marine dropped, because it
         was his favourite object and province. He employed Pondevelle to make a song on the
         Pompadour: it was clever and bitter, and did not spare even majesty. This was Maurepas
         absurd enough to sing at supper at Versailles. Banishment ensued; and lest he should
         ever be restored, the mistress persuaded the king that he had poisoned her predecessor
         madame de Chateauroux.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Maurepas is very agreeable, and exceedingly cheerful; yet I have seen a transient
         silent cloud when politics are talked of.</p>
      <p>Madame de Boufflers,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who was in England, is a sÃ§avante, mistress of the prince of Conti,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and very desirous of being his wife. She is two women, the upper and the lower. I
         need not tell you that the lower is galant, and still has pretensions. The upper is
         very sensible too, and has a measured eloquence that is just and pleasingâ&#x80;&#x93;but all
         is spoiled by an unrelaxed attention to applause. You would think she was always sitting
         for her picture to her biographer.</p>
      <p>Madame de Rochfort<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is different from all the rest. Her understanding is just and delicate; with a finesse
         of wit that is the result of reflection. Her manner is soft and feminine, and though
         a sÃ§avante, without any declared pretensions. She is the <span style="font-style:italic">decent</span> friend of monsieur de Nivernois;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for you must not believe a syllable of what you read in their novels. It requires
         the greatest curiosity, or the greatest habitude, to discover the smallest connection
         between the sexes here. No familiarity, but under the veil of friendship, is permitted,
         and love's dictionary is as much prohibited, as at first sight one should think his
         ritual was. All you hear, and that pronounced with nonchalance, is, that <span style="font-style:italic">monsieur un tel</span> has had <span style="font-style:italic">madame une telle.</span> The duc de Nivernois has parts, and writes at the top of the mediocre, but, as madame
         Geoffrin says, is <span style="font-style:italic">manquÃ© par tout; guerrier manquÃ©, ambassadeur manquÃ©, homme d'affaires manquÃ©,</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">auteur manquÃ©</span>â&#x80;&#x93; no, he is not <span style="font-style:italic">homme de naissance manquÃ©.</span> He would think freely, but has some ambition of being governor to the dauphin,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and is more afraid of his wife<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and daughter,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who are ecclesiastic fagots. The former out-chatters the duke of Newcastle; and the
         latter, madame de Gisors, exhausts Mr. Pitt's eloquence in defence of the archbishop<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Paris. Monsieur de Nivernois lives in a small circle of dependent admirers, and
         madame de Rochfort is high priestess for a small salary of credit.</p>
      <p>The duchess of Choiseul,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the only young one of these heroines, is not very pretty, but has fine eyes, and
         is a little model in wax-work, which not being allowed to speak for some time as incapable,
         has a hesitation and modesty, the latter of which the court has not cured, and the
         former of which is atoned for by the most interesting sound of voice, and forgotten
         in the most elegant turn and propriety of expression. Oh! it is the gentlest, amiable,
         civil, little creature that ever came out of a fairy egg! So just in its phrases and
         thoughts, so attentive and good-natured! Every body loves it, but its husband, who
         prefers his own sister the duchesse de Grammont,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> an amazonian, fierce, haughty dame, who loves and hates arbitrarily, and is detested.
         Madame de Choiseul, passionately fond of her husband, was the martyr of this union,
         but at last submitted with a good grace; has gained a little credit with him, and
         is still believed to idolize himâ&#x80;&#x93;But I doubt itâ&#x80;&#x93;she takes too much pains to profess
         it.</p>
      <p>I cannot finish my list without adding a much more common characterâ&#x80;&#x93;but more complete
         in its kind than any of the foregoing, the marechale de Luxembourg.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> She has been very handsome, very abandoned, and very mischievous. Her beauty is gone,
         her lovers are gone, and she thinks the devil is coming. This dejection has softened
         her into being rather agreeable, for she has wit and good-breeding; but you would
         swear, by the restlessness of her person and the horrors she cannot conceal, that
         she had signed the compact, and expected to be called upon in a week for the performance.</p>
      <p>I could add many pictures, but none so remarkable. In those I send you, there is not
         a feature bestowed gratis or exaggerated. For the beauties, of which there are a few
         considerable, as mesdames de Brionne,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> de Monaco,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> et d'Egmont,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> they have not yet lost their characters, nor got any.</p>
      <p>You must not attribute my intimacy with Paris to curiosity alone. An accident unlocked
         the doors for me. That <span style="font-style:italic">passe-partout,</span> called the fashion, has made them fly openâ&#x80;&#x93;and what do you think was that fashion?â&#x80;&#x93;I
         myselfâ&#x80;&#x93;Yes, like queen Elinor in the ballad, I sunk at Charing-cross,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and have risen in the fauxbourg St. Germain. A <span style="font-style:italic">plaisanterie</span> on Rousseau,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whose arrival here in his way to you brought me acquainted with many anecdotes conformable
         to the idea I had conceived of him, got about, was liked much more than it deserved,
         spread like wildfire, and made me the subject of conversation. Rousseau's devotees
         were offended. Madame de Boufflers, with a tone of sentiment, and the accents of lamenting
         humanity, abused me heartily, and then complained to myself with the utmost softness.
         I acted contrition, but had like to have spoiled all, by growing dreadfully tired
         of a second lecture from the prince of Conti, who took up the ball, and made himself
         the hero of a history wherein he had nothing to do. I listened, did not understand
         half he said (nor he neither), forgot the rest, said Yes when I should have said No,
         yawned when I should have smiled, and was very penitent when I should have rejoiced
         at my pardon. Madame de Boufflers was more distressed, for he owned twenty times more
         than I had said: she frowned, and made him signs; but she had wound up his clack,
         and there was no stopping it. The moment she grew angry, the [lord of the house]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> grew charmed, and it has been my fault if I am not at the head of a numerous sect:â&#x80;&#x93;but
         when I left a triumphant party in England, I did not come hither to be at the head
         of a fashion. However, I have been sent for about like an African prince or a learned
         canary-bird, and was, in particular, carried by force to the princess of Talmond,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the queen's cousin, who lives in a charitable apartment in the Luxembourg, and was
         sitting on a small bed hung with saints and Sobieskis, in a corner of one of those
         vast chambers, by two blinking tapers. I stumbled over a cat, a foot-stool, and a
         chamber-pot in my journey to her presence. She could not find a syllable to say to
         me, and the visit ended with her begging a lap-dog. Thank the Lord! though this is
         the first month, it is the last week, of my reign; and I shall resign my crown with
         great satisfaction to a bouillie of chestnuts, which is just invented, and whose annals
         will be illustrated by so many indigestions, that Paris will not want any thing else
         these three weeks. I will enclose the fatal letter after I have finished this enormous
         one; to which I will only add, that nothing has interrupted my SevignÃ©-researches
         but the frost. The abbÃ© de Malesherbes has given me full power to ransack Livry.
         I did not tell you, that by great accident, when I thought on nothing less, I stumbled
         on an original picture of the comte de Grammont.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
