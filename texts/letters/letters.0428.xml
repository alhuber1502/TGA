         <p>I ought long since to have made you my acknowledgements for the obliging testimonies of your esteem that you have confer'd on
						me: but Count Algarotti's books did not come to my hands till the
					end of July, &amp; since that time I have been prevented by illness from doing any of my duties. I
					have read them more than once with increasing satisfaction, &amp; should wish Mankind had eyes to descry the genuine sources of their
					own pleasures, &amp; judgement to know the extent, that Nature has prescribed to them: if this were the case, it would be their
					interest to appoint C: Algarotti their <hi rend="italic">Arbiter Elegantiarum.</hi> he is highly civil to our Nation, but there is one
					little point, in wch he does not do us justice. I am the more sollicitous about it, because it
					relates to the only Taste we can call our own, the only proof of our original talent in matter of pleasure; I mean, our skill in
					gardening, &amp; laying out grounds. that the Chinese have this beautiful Art in high perfection, seems very probable from the Jesuit's
						Letters, &amp; more from Chambers's little discourse publish'd
					some few years ago. but it is very certain, we copied nothing from them, nor had any thing but nature for our model. it is not forty
					years, since the Art was born among us; and it is sure, that there was nothing in Europe like it, &amp; as sure, we then had no
					information on this head from China at all.
				</p>
         <p>I shall rejoice to see you in England, &amp; talk over these and many other matters with you at leisure. do not despair of your
					health, because you have not found all the effects you had promised yourself from a finer climate. I have known People, who have
					experienced the same thing, &amp; yet at their return have lost all their complaints as by miracle. </p>

            <p>I have answer'd C: Algarotti, whose letter I convey'd to Mr Mason, but whether he has received his
						books, I have not yet heard. Mr Brown charges me with his best Compliments.</p>
