         <div class="salute">Dear Mason</div>
      </div>
      <p>I have (as I desired St:r to tell you) read over Caractacus twice not with pleasure
         only, but with emotion.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you may say what you will, but the contrivance, the manners, the interests, the passions,
         &amp; the expression, go beyond the dramatic part<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of your Elfrida many many leagues. I even say (tho' you will think me a bad judge
         of this) that the <span style="font-style:italic">World</span> will like it better. I am struck with the Chorus, who are not there merely to sing
         &amp; dance, but bear throughout a principal part in the action, &amp; have, (beside the <span style="font-style:italic">Costume,</span> wch is excellent) as much a character of their own, as any other Person. I am charmed
         with their priestly pride &amp; obstinacy, when after all is lost, they resolve to confront
         the Roman General, &amp; spit in his face: but now I am going to tell you, what touches
         me most, from the beginning. the first opening is greatly improved: the curiosity
         of Didius<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is now a very natural reason for dwelling on each particular of the scene before
         him, nor is the description at all too long. I am glad to find the two young Men<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are Cartismandua's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Sons. they interest me far more. I love People of Condition. they were Men before,
         that no body knew: one could not make them a bow, if one had met them at a publick
         place.
      </p>
      <p>I always admired that interruption of the Druids to Evelina,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <span style="font-style:italic">Peace, Virgin, peace</span> &amp;c: &amp; chiefly the <span style="font-style:italic">abstract Idea personified</span> (to use the words of a Critick) at the end of it. that of Caractacus <span style="font-style:italic">would save my Queen,</span> &amp;c: &amp; still more that, <span style="font-style:italic">I know it reverend Fathers, 'tis Heav'ns high will</span> &amp;c: to <span style="font-style:italic">I've done. begin the rites!</span> this latter is exemplary for the expression (always the great point with me) I do
         not mean by expression the mere choice of words, but the whole dress, fashion, &amp; arrangement
         of a thought. here in particular, it is the brokenness, the ungrammatical position,
         the total subversion of the period, that charms me. all that ushers in the Incantation
         from <span style="font-style:italic">Try we yet, what holiness can do</span> I am delighted with in quite another way, for this is pure poetry, as it ought to
         be, forming the proper transition, &amp; leading on the mind to that still purer poetry,
         that follows it. You have somehow mistaken my meaning about the <span style="font-style:italic">sober Sisters</span>: the verb <span style="font-style:italic">nod</span> before only seem'd to be a verb neuter; now you have made it absolutely such, wch
         was just my objection to it. but it is easily alter'd, for if the accusative case
         come first, there is no danger of ambiguity. I read
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>See! their gold &amp; ebon rod <br /> Where the sober Sisters nod, <br /> And greet in whispers sage &amp; slow. <br /> Snowden mark! 'tis Magick's hour; <br /> Now the mutter'd spell hath power, <br /> Power to rift thy ribs of rock, <br /> To burst thy base with thunder's shock, <br /> But &amp;c: &amp;c: <br /> —— than those, that dwell <br /> In Musick's &amp;c:
         </p>
      </div>
      <p>you will laugh at my <span style="font-style:italic">to</span>ses &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">those</span>s, but they strike my ear better. what Mador sings, must be the finest thing, that
         ever was wrote; &amp; the next Chorus, where they all go to sleep, must be finer still.
      </p>
      <p>In the beginning of the succeeding Act, I admire the Chorus again, <span style="font-style:italic">Is it not now the hour, the holy hour,</span> &amp;c: &amp; their evasion of a lie, Sayst thou, proud Boy, &amp;c: &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">sleep with the unsun'd silver,</span> wch is an example of a <span style="font-style:italic">dramatic</span> Simile. the sudden appearance of Caractacus, the pretended respect &amp; admiration of
         Vellinus, &amp; the probability of his story, the distrust of the Druids, &amp; their reasoning
         with Caractacus, &amp; particularly that, <span style="font-style:italic">'Tis meet thou should'st, thou art a King,</span> &amp;c: &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">Mark me, Prince, the time will come, when Destiny,</span> &amp;c: are well, &amp; happily imagined. a-propos of the last striking passage I have mention'd,
         I am going to make a digression.
      </p>
      <p>When we treat a subject, where the manners are almost lost in antiquity, our stock
         of Ideas must needs be small, &amp; nothing betrays our poverty more, than the returning
         to, &amp; harping frequently on one Image. it was therefore I thought you should omitt
         some lines before, tho' good in themselves, about <span style="font-style:italic">the scythed Carr,</span> that the passage now before us might appear with greater lustre, when it came; and
         in this I see, you have complied with me. but there are other Ideas here &amp; there still,
         that occur too often, particularly about <span style="font-style:italic">the Oaks,</span> some of wch I would discard to make way for the rest.
      </p>
      <p>But the subjects I speak off to compensate (&amp; more than compensate) that unavoidable
         poverty, have one great advantage when they fall into good hands. they leave an unbounded
         liberty to pure imagination, &amp; fiction (our favourite provinces) where no Critick
         can molest, or Antiquary gainsay us. &amp; yet (to please me) these fictions must have
         some affinity, some seeming connection with that little we really know of the character
         &amp; customs of the People. for example I never heard in my days, that Midnight &amp; the
         Moon were Sisters, that they carried rods of ebony &amp; gold, or met to whisper on the
         top of a mountain: but now I could lay my life, it is all true; &amp; do not doubt, it
         will be found so in some Pantheon of the Druids, that is to be discover'd in the Library
         at Herculaneum. the <span style="font-style:italic">Car of Destiny &amp; Death</span> is a very noble invention of the same class, &amp; as far as that goes, is so fine, that
         it makes me more delicate, than perhaps I should be, about the close of it. <span style="font-style:italic">Andraste sailing on the wings of Fame,</span> that snatches the wreaths from Oblivion to hang them on her loftiest Amaranth, tho'
         a clear and beautiful piece of <span style="font-style:italic">unknown</span> Mythology, has too <span style="font-style:italic">Greek</span> an air to give me perfect satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>Now I proceed. the preparation to the Chorus, tho' so much akin to that in the former
         act, is excellent. the remarks of Evelina &amp; her suspicions of the Brothers, mix'd
         with a secret inclination to ye younger of them (tho', I think, her part throughout
         wants retouching) yet please me much. and the contrivance of the following scene much
         more. <span style="font-style:italic">Masters of Wisdom, no,</span> &amp;c: I always admired; as I do the rocking stone, &amp; the distress of Elidurus. Evelina's
         examination of him is a well-invented scene, &amp; will be with a little pains a very
         touching one: but the introduction of Arviragus<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is superlative. I am not sure, whether those few lines of his short narrative, <span style="font-style:italic">My strength repair'd, it boots not, that I tell,</span> &amp;c: do not please me as much, as any thing in the whole Drama. the sullen bravery
         of Elidurus, the menaces of the Chorus, that <span style="font-style:italic">Think not,</span> Religion<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c: the Trumpet of the Druids; that <span style="font-style:italic">I'll follow him, tho' in my chains</span> &amp;c:; <span style="font-style:italic">Hast thou a Brother, no</span> &amp;c: the placability of the Chorus, when they see the motives of Elidurus' obstinacy,
         give me great contentment. so do the reflections of the Druid on the necessity of
         lustration, &amp; the reasons for Vellinus' easy escape. but I would not have him <span style="font-style:italic">seize on a spear,</span> nor <span style="font-style:italic">issue hasty thro' the</span> Cavern's mouth.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> why should he not steal away, unmark'd &amp; unmiss'd, till the hurry of passions in
         those, that should have guarded him, was a little abated? but I chiefly admire the
         two speeches of Elidurus, Ah Vellinus, is this then &amp;c: and, <span style="font-style:italic">Ye do gaze on me,</span> Fathers!<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c: the manner, in wch the Chorus reply to him, is very fine, but the image at the
         end wants a little mending. the next scene is highly moving! it is so very good, that
         I must have it made yet better.
      </p>
      <p>Now for the last Act. I do not know, what you would have, but to me the design &amp; contrivance
         of it is at least equal to any part of the Whole. the short-lived triumph of the Britons,
         the address of Caractacus to the Roman Victims, Evelina's discovery of the ambush,
         the mistake of the Roman fires for the rising Sun, the death of Arviragus, the interview
         between Didius, &amp; Caractacus, his mourning over his dead Son, his parting speech (in
         wch you have made all the use of Tacitus, that your Plan would admitt) every thing
         in short, but that little dispute between Didius &amp; him. <span style="font-style:italic">'Tis well. &amp; therefore to encrease that reverence</span> &amp;c: down to, <span style="font-style:italic">Give me a moment</span> (wch must be omitted, or put in the mouth of the Druids) I approve in the highest
         degree. if I should find any fault with the last act, it could only be with trifles
         &amp; little expressions. if you make any alteration, I fear, it will never improve it,
         I mean, as to the Plan. I send you back the two last sheets, because you bid me. I
         reserve my nibblings and <span style="font-style:italic">minutiæ</span> for another day.
