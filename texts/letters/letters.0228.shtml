         <div class="salute">Dear Sir</div>
      </div>
      <p>Amongst the variety of rational entertainments that Travel affords to a thinking mind,
         I have always rankd with the principal that fund wch it presents of new Ideas, peculiarly
         proper to be thrown upon paper in order to form that wch we call a free Epistolary
         correspondence.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> An easy Communication of Sentiments neither obscurd by a cloud of reserve, wch is
         always dissagreable to an amicable reader nor embarrassd by a Burthen of terms recherchÃ©s
         wch is always full as unpleasing to a negligent writer, is the very thing wch I should
         always labor to attain in my productions of this kind, tho perhaps my aim is totally
         chimerical as the stile I speak of may be calld with the Poet</p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>A faultless Monster wch the world neer saw.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      </div>
      <p>Therefore without further apology I shall trust to the sincerity of your friendship
         for a plenary Absolution in this case And proceed in all the simplicity of Narration.</p>
      <p>Germany<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is a countryâ&#x80;&#x93;But why should I tell my Friend who has seen France who has seen Italy
         what kind of a country is Germany. And yet perhaps he will not dispise me for it.
         For tho France is remarkable for its savoir-vivre and Italy for its VirtÃ¹. Yet Germany
         is the reservoir of solid Litterature &amp; therefore not unworthy of the attention of
         a Person who unites all these qualifications in his own particular and may be calld
         without flattery a Microcosm of the talents both of his own Island &amp; the continent.
         But Hard very hard is my fate that I cannot give him any satisfactory account of the
         state of Germanic Learning Having only as yet had a single Interview with MynHerr
         Shite the Royal Librarian of this place. MynnHerr Shite is of a roundish squab figure
         and of a face corresponding, that is as his Body is cylindrical, his face is rather
         circular than Oval, He apparells himself generally in a decent grass-green Suit. With
         a fair full Peruke not too full to break upon the spherical form of his cheeks &amp; yet
         full enough to add a graceful squarness on each side of them. The Altitude of his
         square-toedshoe heels the breadth of his Milk and waterd Rollups<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and the size of his amber-headed Cane are all truly symbolical not only of his own
         Genius but of that of all his Compatriots. When I say that Mynheer Shite is the only
         erudite person whom I have yet seen, I must be understood to mean in this place, for
         when I lately made a tour to Hamburg, I met with another tho of a different Sex, her
         name Madam Belcht. Her person I will not attempt to describe But will endeavor to
         give you a morceau of Her Conversation, for I was honord with it, She askd me who
         was the famous Poet that writ the Nitt toats. I replyd Doctr Yonge.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> She begd leave to drink his Health in a Glass of sweet wine adding that he was her
         favrite English Author. We toasted the Doctor. Upon wch having a mind to give my Parnassian
         Toast, I askd Madame Belch if she had ever read La Petite Elegie dans La CÅ&#x93;meterie
         Rustique, C'est Beaucoup Jolie je vous Assure! (for I had said fort jolie very often
         before). Oui Monsr (replyd Madame Belch) Je lu, &amp; elle est bien Jolie &amp; Melancholique
         mais elle ne touche point La CÅ&#x93;ur comme mes tres cheres Nitt toats.</p>
      <p>The Prudence you recommended to me at parting &amp; wch you yourself are so remarkable
         for I shall strictly observe &amp; therefore will say nothing of the Place I am in. Indeed
         I have nothing to say if I was not prudent, only that it is the noisiest Place I ever
         was in, &amp; that I want to get out of it, wch I hope is no treason. I have sent Lord
         John Cavendish<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a list of the Noises &amp; their times of beginning wch will give you some Idea if he
         shews you the Letter.</p>
      <p>Oh Mr Gray! I bought at Hamburg such a piano Forte,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and so cheap, it is a Harpsichord too of 2 Unisons &amp; the Jacks serve as mutes (when
         the Piano Forte stop is playd) by the cleverest mechanism imaginable.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Wont you buy my Kirkman?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Pray Mr Gray write soon (how strangly is my stile changd since the beginning!) and
         tell me about Rousseau or any thing. It's great Charity, I do assure you; I would
         have writ to you before but Hamburg &amp; Reviews prevented me. Whitehead head is here
         with his two lordlings.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> You would delight in Lord Newnam,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he's so peevish &amp; hates things so much &amp; has so much sense. Lord Villiers<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is Plumer<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> exceedingly polishd. Whitehead talks rather too much of Princesses of the Blood in
         a way between jest &amp; earnest that most people must mistake &amp; take for Admiration.
         The rest of the English are Earl<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Peterhouse, Sutton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; just now Bagnal<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Trinity, With Grooms, Dogs, Tutors &amp; all. Whitworth<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is also soon expected so that I think we shall soon have a pretty Partie enough.
         O the Duce take that confounded Drum &amp; fife it plagues me past endurance.</p>
