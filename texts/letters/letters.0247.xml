         <p> If all the Greek you transcribed for me were Poetry already I would bestir myself to oblige you
					&amp; Mr Rivett, but as it is no more than measured Prose, &amp; as unfortunately (in English verse) a
					Tripod with two ears, or more, has no more dignity than a Chamber-pot with one, I do not see, why you would have me Dress it up with
					any florid additions, wch it must have, if it would appear in rhyme; nor why it will not prove its point as well in a plain prose
					translation, as in the best numbers of Dryden. if you think otherwise, why don't you do it yourself, &amp; consult me, if you think
					fit. I rejoice to hear the Prints succeed so well, &amp; am impatient for the work, but do not approve the <hi rend="italic">fine
						Lady</hi> part of it. what business have such people with Athens? I applaud your scheme for
						Gaskarth, &amp; wish it could have succeeded. he bears his disappointment like a Philosopher, but his
					health is very bad. I have had the honour myself of some little grumblings of the Gout for this fortnight, &amp; yesterday it would not
					let me put on a shoe to hear the Frasi in, so you may imagine I am in a sweet amiable humour.
					nevertheless I think of being in Town (perhaps I may not be able to stir) the middle of next week with
						Montagu. you are so cross-grain'd as to go to Tunbridge just before I come, but I will give you the
					trouble to enquire about my old quarters at Roberts's, if I can probably have a lodging at that time.
					if not there; may be I can be in <hi rend="italic">the Oven,</hi>
					 wch will do well enough for a Sinner. be so good to give me notice, &amp; the sooner the better. I
					shall not stay above a week, &amp; then go to Stoke. I rejoice to know, that the genial influences of the Spring, wch produce nothing
					but the Gout in me, have hatched high &amp; unimaginable fantasies in you. I see methinks (as I sit on
					Snowden) some Glimpse of Mona, &amp; her haunted shades &amp; hopes we shall be very good Neighbours. any Druidical Anecdotes that I
					can meet with, I will be sure to send you. I am of your opinion, that the Ghosts will spoil the Picture, unless they are thrown at a
					huge distance, &amp; extremely <hi rend="italic">kept down.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The British Flag (I fear) has behaved itself like a Train'd-band Pair of Colours in
						Bunhill-fields. I think every day of going to Switzerland. will you be
					of the party, or stay &amp; sing Mass at Aston?</p>
         <closer>
