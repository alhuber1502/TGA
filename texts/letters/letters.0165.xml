            <salute>My Dear Wharton</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>After having made my Compliments to the Godmothers of the little Doctress, who are to promise &amp;
					vow for her that she shall understand, &amp; be grateful some twelve or fifteen Years hence I congratulate Mrs Wharton &amp; your
					family on this Occasion, &amp; doubtless desire nothing more than to see you all the next Summer, tho' as to Promises, I dare not; lest
					some unlucky Event again come across, &amp; put the Performance out of my Power. I am not certain whether I shall be obliged to have
					recourse to your Assistance or no about Christmas: but if I am, I will be sure to give you Notice in
					due Time.</p>
         <p>I am glad you have had any Pleasure in Gresset: he seems to me a truly elegant &amp; charming Writer. the Mechant is the best Comedy
					I ever read. Edward I could scarce get thro': it is puerile; tho'
					there are good Lines; such as this, for Example <q>
               <p>Le jour d'un nouveau regne est le jour des ingrats.</p>
            </q> but good Lines will make any thing rather than a good Play. however you are to consider, this is a Collection made by the Dutch
					Booksellers. many Things unfinish'd or wrote in his Youth, or design'd not for the World, but to make a few Friends laugh, as the
					Lutrin vivant, &amp;c: there are two noble Verses, wch as they are in the middle of an <hi rend="italic">Ode to the King,</hi>
					 may perhaps have escaped you. <q>
               <p>Le Cri d'un peuple heureux est la seule Eloquence, <lb/> Qui sÃ§ait parler des Rois.</p>
            </q> wch is very true, &amp; should have been a Hint to himself not to write Odes to the King at all. </p>
         <p>My Squabble with the Professor I did not think worth mentioning to you. my Letter was by no means
					intended as a Composition, &amp; only design'd to be shew'd to some, who were Witnesses to the Impertinence, that gave Occasion for it:
					but he was Fool enough by Way of Revenge to make it mighty publick.</p>
         <p>I don't wonder your Mr Bolby disapproves Mr [ ] Conduct at Rome:
					it was indeed very unlike his own. but when every body there of our Nation was base enough either to enter into an actual
					Correspondence with a certain most serene Person, or at least to talk carelessly &amp; doubtfully on
					what was then transacting at home, sure it was the Part of a Man of Spirit to declare his Sentiments publickly &amp; warmly. he was so
					far from making a Party, that he &amp; Mr ... were the only Persons, that were of that Party. as to
					his Ends in it; from his first Return to England he has always frequented the Prâ&#x80;&#x93;ces Court, &amp; been the open Friend of Mr. H:
						W: wch could certainly be no Way to recommend himself to the Ministry: unless you suppose his Views
					were very distant indeed.</p>
         <p>I should wish to know (when you can find Time for a Letter) what you think of my young Friend, St:r
					&amp; what Company he is fall'n into in the North. I fill up with the Beginning of a Sort of Essay.
					what Name to give it I know not, but the Subject is, the Alliance of Education &amp; Government; I mean to shew that they must
					necessarily concur to produce great &amp; useful Men.</p>
         <q>
            <p>As sickly Plants betray a niggard Earth, <lb/> Whose flinty Bosom starves her generous Birth, <lb/> Nor genial Warmth, nor genial
						Juice retains <lb/> Their Roots to feed, &amp; fill their verdant Veins. <lb/> And as in Climes, where Winter holds his Reign,
						<lb/> The Soil, tho' fertile, will not teem in vain, <lb/> Forbids her Gems to swell, her Shades to rise, <lb/> Nor trusts her
						Blossoms to the churlish Skies. <lb/> So draw Mankind in vain the vital Airs, <lb/> Unform'd, unfriended, by those kindly Cares,
						<lb/> That Health &amp; Vigour to the Soul impart, <lb/> Spread the young Thought, &amp; warm the opening Heart. <lb/> So fond
						Instruction on the growing Powers <lb/> Of Nature idly lavishes her Stores: <lb/> If equal Justice with unclouded Face <lb/> Smile
						not indulgent on the rising Race, <lb/> And scatter with a free, tho' frugal, Hand <lb/> Light golden Showers of Plenty o'er the
						Land. <lb/> But gloomy Sway have fix'd her Empire there <lb/> To check their tender Hopes with chilling Fear, <lb/> And blast the
						vernal Promise of the Year. <lb/>This spacious animated Scene survey <lb/> From where the rowling Orb, that gives the Day, <lb/> His
						sable Sons with nearer Course surrounds <lb/> To either Pole, and Life's remotest Bounds: <lb/> How rude soe'er th'exteriour Form we
						find, <lb/> Howe'er Opinion tinge the varied Mind; <lb/> Alike to all the Kind impartial Heav'n <lb/> The Sparks of Truth &amp;
						Happiness has given. <lb/> With Sense to feel, with Mem'ry to retain, <lb/> They follow Pleasure, &amp; they fly from Pain. <lb/>
						Their Judgement mends the Plan their Fancy draws, <lb/> Th' Event presages, &amp; explores the Cause. <lb/> The soft Returns of
						Gratitude they know, <lb/> By Fraud elude, by Force repell the Foe, <lb/> While mutual Wishes, mutual Woes endear <lb/> The social
						Smile &amp; sympathetic Tear. <lb/> Say then, thro' Ages by what Fate confined <lb/> To different Climes seem diff'rent Souls
						assign'd? <lb/> Here measured Laws &amp; philosophic Ease <lb/> Fix &amp; improve the polish'd Arts of Peace: <lb/> There Industry
						&amp; Gain their Vigils keep, <lb/> Command the Winds, &amp; tame th'unwilling Deep, <lb/> Here Force &amp; hardy Deeds of Blood
						prevail: <lb/> There languid Pleasure sighs in every Gale. <lb/> Oft o'er the trembling Nations from afar <lb/> Has Scythia
						breath'd the living Cloud of War: <lb/> And where the Deluge burst, with sweepy Sway <lb/> Their Arms, their Kings, their gods were
						roll'd away, <lb/> As oft have issued, Host impelling Host, <lb/> The blue-eyed Myriads from the
						Baltic Coast,<lb/> The prostrate South to the Destroyer yields <lb/> Her boasted Titles &amp; her golden Fields; <lb/> With grim
						Delight the Brood of Winter view <lb/> A brighter Day &amp; Skies of azure Hue <lb/> Catch the new Fragrance of the breathing Rose,
						<lb/> And quaff the pendent Vintage, as it grows. </p>
            <p/>
         </q>
         <p>I desire your Judgement upon so far, before I proceed any farther.</p>
