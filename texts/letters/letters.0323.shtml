      </div>
      <p>Having been for a considerable time without any news of you, I have taken it into
         my head, that you are ill, or that Mrs Wharton is so. you will not wonder, if I grow
         a little superstitious, when you know, that I have not been a step out of the house
         for this fortnight or more past, for Mrs Rogers has been at the point of death with
         a disorder in her stomach accompanied with continual &amp; laborious reachings, &amp; a total
         loss of appetite, that has reduced her to the weakness of an infant, I mean, her body,
         tho' her senses are still perfect, &amp; (what I think remarkable) she has recover'd the
         use of her speech (wch for several years had been hardly intelligible) &amp; pronounces
         almost as plain, as ever she did. she is now for three days past, such is the strength
         of her constitution, in a way of recovery: medecine has had nothing to do in it, for
         she will take nothing prescribed her. when I say recovery, I do not mean, that she
         will ever recover her strength again, but, I think, she may live a good while in this
         helpless state; however it is very precarious, &amp; Dr Hayes believes her quite worn
         out. I certainly do not put on (to you) more tenderness, than I really feel on this
         occasion, but the approaches of death are always a melancholy object, &amp; common humanity
         must suffer something from such a spectacle
      </p>
      <p>It is an age, since I heard any thing from Mason. if I do not mistake, this should
         be his month of waiting, unless he has exchanged his turn with some body: if he be
         in Town, you must probably have heard of him, &amp; can give me some intelligence. my
         old new acquaintance Lady Denbigh is here at Stokehouse; but I do not believe, I shall
         be able to get out, or have any opportunity of seeing her, while she stays.
      </p>
      <p>If my fancies (wch I hope in God are mere fancies) should prove true, I hope you will
         let somebody tell me, how you do. if not, I shall beg you to tell me yourself, as
         soon as possible, &amp; set my understanding to rights.
      </p>
