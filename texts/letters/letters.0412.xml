            <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>If you still are residing &amp; precenting at York, I feel a great propensity to visit you there in my way Northwards. don't be
					frighted; for I do not mean to be invited to your house: I can bring many reasons against it, but will content myself with referring
					you to Mr Whitehead's <hi rend="italic">Satyr on Friendship,</hi>
					 the sentiment of which you thought as natural, as I did the verses. I therefore desire of you to
					procure me a lodging by the week (the cheaper the better) where there is a parlour, &amp; bed-chamber &amp; some closet (or other place
					near it) for a servant's bed. perhaps I may stay a fortnight, &amp; should like, when I have a mind, to have any little thing dress'd
					at home. probably I may arrive next week, but you shall have exacter notice of my motions, when they are settled.</p>
         <p>Dr Delap (your Friend) is here, &amp; we celebrate very cordially your good qualities in spite of
					all your bad ones. we are rather sorry, that you, who have so just a sense of the dignity of your function, should write letters of wit
					&amp; humour to Ld D: &amp; his sweet Daughter in the Royal (I think it is) or Lady's Magazine: but
					you are very rightly served for your vivacity, &amp; reflection upon poor K: Hunter.
