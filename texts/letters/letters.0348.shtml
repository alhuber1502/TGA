      <p>The Death of the poor Alderman is an event, that you have so long weekly expected,
         that (tho' it may justly afflict his family) yet it could not surprise them.
      </p>
      <p>I am sorry to hear of the attempt making to deprive your Mamma of her Office at such
         a time, &amp; do not understand upon what pretences your enemies should ground such a
         proceeding, when she had so lately too obtain'd a confirmation of it. they charge
         her to be sure with something; whether justly or unjustly is not the Question, but
         any Friend, who would enter into her cause &amp; justify her effectually, must be acquainted
         with what is objected, &amp; with the reasons she can alledge in her own defence, w<span class="super">ch</span> are (I hope) sufficient to set aside the malice of these people. M<span class="super">r</span> Shelvocke, if he is continued in his office, seems the first Person to apply to,
         &amp; (I should imagine) you have already done so. tho' I have not seen him for years,
         I should not scruple speaking to him myself, but that you have not furnish'd me with
         any thing to say; &amp; (if he should not be a friend to our cause, w<span class="super">ch</span> is a thing I do not know) I might perhaps do more hurt than good by interposing.
         neither of the Post-Masters are (as you suppose) related to M<span class="super">r</span> Pitt: one is the Earl of Bessborough, &amp; the other M<span class="super">r</span> Trevor-Hambden. what I could, I have done: by this night's post I have wrote to L<span class="super">d</span> John Cavendish, who is Brother to L<span class="super">d</span> Bessborough, to desire he would write, or speak a word in behalf of your Mamma: but
         he is as far off as Chatsworth in Derbyshire, &amp; besides (tho' I believe inclined enough
         to oblige me) naturally very shy &amp; backward in asking any thing even from his nearest
         Relations. therefore I can by no means promise myself success, &amp; especially if the
         case should be (what I once told you I was afraid of) that M<span class="super">rs</span> A:<span class="super">s</span> should have trusted your Gr: Papa with any money belonging to the Office, w<span class="super">ch</span> may be now suddenly demanded of her, w<span class="super">ch</span> I should be extremely sorry for.
      </p>
      <p>If there is any thing else I can do, inform me; but my connection with People in power
         is very small, &amp; that little I have never employed in asking favours at their hands,
         even for myself. I do not recollect any body, that I know, who has any interest in
         M<span class="super">r</span> Trevor: he is Uncle to the Dutchess of Marlb'rough, if your Mamma knows any means
         of applying to her.
      </p>
      <p>My Service to M<span class="super">rs</span> Antrobus. I do not at all expect, she should write herself at such a time, &amp; think
         you may very well be her scribe.

         <p>Love to Dolly . . . pray, may I communicate with Powdish on this subject for any information,
            or is it better not? I am not at all well, &amp; have a sort of fever: they tell me I
            am going to have a Jaundice.
