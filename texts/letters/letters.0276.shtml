      <p>I am extremely sorry to hear of poor Mr Bentley's illness. what I can not account
         for is, that You or He should trust such a Dog of an Apothecary, after he had shew'd
         himself, to do any thing, even to sell medecines; when it is just as easy for him
         to put in a grain of slow poison, as to administer a dose of pure &amp; innocent brown-Paper.

      <p>Dodsley sent me some copies<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> last week: they are very pleasant to the eye, &amp; will do no dishonour to your Press.
         as you are but young in the trade, you will excuse me if I tell you, that some little
         inaccuracies have escaped your eye, as in the 9th page <span style="font-style:italic">Lab'rinth's</span> &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">Echo's,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (wch are Nominat:s plural,) with Apostrophes after them, as tho' they were Genitives
         singular; &amp; P: 16, sorrow &amp; solitude<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> without capital letters. besides certain Commas here &amp; there omitted. if you do not
         commit greater faults in your next work, I shall grow jealous of Hentzerus.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I am going to add to the trouble I have given you by desiring you would tell me, what
         you hear any body say, (I mean, if any body says any thing). I know you will forgive
         this vanity of an Author, as the vanity of a Printer is a little interested in the
         same cause. the Garricks<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> have been here for three days much to my entertainment. if you see him, do not fail
         to make him tell you the story of <span style="font-style:italic">Bull &amp; Poker.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
