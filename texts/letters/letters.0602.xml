					       <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>When I return'd to Cambridge, I found a long letter from De B: expressing much kindness, but in a
					style <hi rend="italic">un peu trop alambiqu√©,</hi>
					 &amp; yesterday I had another shorter, &amp; making bad excuses
					for not writing oftener: he seems at present to give into all the French nonsense &amp; to be employ'd much like an English boy broke
					loose from his Governor. I want much to know, whether he has wrote to you yet: if not, I am seriously angry, tho' to little purpose. A
						<hi rend="italic">Marquis de Villevielle,</hi>
					 who is here with the French Embassador, has found me out, &amp;
					seems a quiet good sort of young Man. he knows &amp; tries to speak English, &amp; has <hi rend="italic">translated me</hi> by way of
					exercise. that is our bond of union, but I have seen no specimen yet. he returns home soon with Mr de Chatelet; but means to return
					&amp; acquaint himself better with this country.</p>
				     <p>On Monday or Tuesday I mean to leave this place &amp; after passing two or three days at Cambridge
					proceed to Aston, where Mason expects me. now if you like to accompany me, you will meet me at Camb:
					&amp; we pursue our way together, trees blooming &amp; nightingales singing all round us. let me know your mind &amp; direct to me at
					Camb:ge.</p>
				     <p>I have not forgot your microscope, but my Mr Ramsden (Mason's Favourite) is such a Lyar &amp; a
					Fool, that ten to one it is not finish'd this month or two. my respects to Mrs. Nicholls! I hope the sermon is compleated between you.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu! I am faithfully yours</salute>
