      <p>Since I had the pleasure of receiving your last letter, wch did not reach me, till
         I had left the North, &amp; was come to London, I have been confined to my room with a
         fit of the gout: now I am recover'd &amp; in quiet at Cambridge, I take up my pen to thank
         you for your very friendly offers, wch have so much the air of frankness &amp; real good-meaning,
         that were my body as tractable &amp; easy of conveyance as my mind, you would see me tomorrow
         in the chamber you have so hospitably laid out for me at Aberdeen. but, alas! I am
         a summer-bird, &amp; can only sit drooping, till the sun returns: even then too my wings
         may chance to be clipp'd, &amp; little in plight for so distant an excursion.
      </p>
      <p>The proposal you make me about printing, what little I have ever written, at Glasgow
         does me honour. I leave my reputation in that part of the kingdom to your care, &amp;
         only desire you would not let your partiality to me &amp; mine mislead you. if you persist
         in your design, Mr Foulis certainly ought to be acquainted of what I am now going
         to tell you. when I was in London the last spring, Dodsley the Bookseller ask'd my
         leave to reprint, in a smaller form all I have ever publish'd, to wch I consented;
         &amp; added, that I would send him a few explanatory notes, &amp; if he would omitt entirely
         the <span style="font-style:italic">Long Story</span> (wch was never meant for the publick, &amp; only suffer'd to appear in that pompous edition
         because of Mr Bentley's designs, wch were not intelligible without it) I promised
         to send him some thing else to print instead of it, least the bulk of so small a volume
         should be reduced to nothing at all. now it is very certain, that I had rather see
         them printed at Glasgow (especially as you will condescend to revise the press) than
         at London, but I know not how to retract my promise to Dodsley. by the way you perhaps
         may imagine, that I have some kind of interest in this publication: but the truth
         is, I have none whatever. the expence is his &amp; so is the profit, if there be any.
         I therefore told him the other day in general terms, that I heard, there would be
         an edition put out in Scotland by a friend of mine, whom I could not refuse, &amp; that
         if so, I would send thither a copy of the same notes &amp; additions, that I had promised
         to send to him. this did not seem at all to cool his courage; Mr Foulis therefore
         must judge for himself, whether he thinks it worth while to print, what is going to
         be printed also at London. if he does I will send him (in a packet to you) the same
         things I shall send to Dodsley. they are imitations of two pieces of old Norwegian
         poetry, in wch there was a wild spirit, that struck me: but for my paraphrases I can
         not say much. you will judge. the rest are nothing but a few parallel passages; &amp;
         small notes just to explain, what People said at the time was wrap'd in total darkness.
         you will please to tell me, as soon as you can conveniently, what Mr F:s says on this
         head, that (if he drops the design) I may save myself &amp; you the trouble of this packet.
         I ask your pardon for talking so long about it: a little more &amp; my letter would be
         as big as all <span style="font-style:italic">my works.</span></p>
      <p>I have read with much pleasure an Ode of yours (in wch you have done me the honour
         to adopt a measure, that I have used) on Ld Hay's birth-day. tho' I do not love <span style="font-style:italic">panegyrick,</span> I can not but applaud this, for there is nothing mean in it. the diction is easy
         &amp; noble. the texture of the thoughts lyrick, &amp; the versification harmonious. the fourth
         Stanza is particularly my favourite (<span style="font-style:italic">the Muse with joy</span> &amp;c:) for the contrast of images; &amp; the three follo[wing]  are excellent: not so the
         last. it is rather sp[un out] &amp; the thoughts repeated. I object a little too to (in
         St: 2d) <span style="font-style:italic">All energy of mind.</span> the word <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> weakens the verse; &amp; again in St: 6, <span style="font-style:italic">O yet e'er Luxury.</span>  that word can not be contracted to a dissyllable without harshness, tho' <span style="font-style:italic">Mem'ry</span> may. these indeed are Minuti√¶, but they weigh for something, as half a grain makes
         a difference in the value of a diamond.
