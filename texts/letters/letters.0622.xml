         <p>It never rains, but it pours, my dear Doctor. you will be glad to hear, that Mr Br: has added to his Mastership (wch is better than
					150£ a-year) a Living hard by Cambridge, Stretham in the isle of Ely, worth, as it was lett above 40
					years ago, at least 240£ more. it was in the gift of the Crown during the vacancy of the See of Ely, &amp; that its value is really
					more than I have said, you will hardly doubt, when you hear, it was carried against an Earl, a Baron, &amp; a Bishop, the latter of the three so strenuous a Suitor, that he still persisted above a week after I had seen the
					Presentation sign'd to Mr B: by the King's own hand, nay, he still persisted a day, after the K: had publickly declared in the
					Drawing-room, that he had given it Mr B: by name. and who was this bishop? no other than your Friend, who wanted it for a Nephew of
					his, a <hi rend="italic">poor unfortunate</hi> Nephew, that had been so imprudent many a year ago to
					marry a Farmer's daughter, where he boarded, when Curate; &amp; continued ever since under a cloud, because his uncle would give him
					nothing. as to us, we had a Duke, an Earl, a Viscount, &amp; a Bishop on our side, &amp; carried it
					so swimmingly you would stare again. there was a prologue &amp; an exegesis &amp; a peripeteia, &amp; all the parts of a regular drama;
					&amp; the Heroe is gone to London, was instituted yesterday, &amp; today is gone to Lambeth, for the Archbishop too spoke a good word for us &amp; at a very critical time. the old Lodge
					has got rid of all its harpsichords &amp; begins to brighten up: its inhabitant is lost like a Mouse
					in an old cheese. he has received your generous offer of a benefaction to the common good, but it is too much to tax yourself: however
					we all intend to bring in our mites, &amp; shew the way to the high &amp; mighty: when a fund is once
					on foot, they will bestirr themselves.</p>
         <p>I am sincerely concern'd to find Miss Wharton is still an Invalide. I believe, you must send her into the milder regions of the
					South, where the sun dispells all maladies. we ourselves have had an untoward season enough: vast quantities of rain instead of winter,
					the Thermom:r never below 40 deg:, often above 50, before Christmas; unusual high winds (wch still continue) particularly the 19th of
					Dec: at night it blew a dreadful storm. the first grain of snow was seen on Xmas Day, of wch we have had a good deal since, but never
					deep or lasting. the 2d week in Jan: was really severe cold at London, &amp; the Thames frozen over. one morning that week the glass
					stood here (at 8 in the morning) at 16 degrees, wch is the lowest I ever knew it at Cambridge. at London it never has been observed
					lower than 13 (understand me right: I mean, 13 above Zero of Farenheit) &amp; that was 5 Jan, 1739.
					now it is very mild again, but with very high winds at N:W:.</p>
         <p>I give you joy of our awkward peace with Spain. Mason is in Town
					taking his swing, like a Boy in breaking-up-time. remember me kindly to Mrs Wharton, &amp; all the good family. did I tell you of my
					breaking up in summer in the midland counties, &amp; so as far as Abergavenny one way, &amp; Ludlow the other? I have another journal for you, in several volumes. I have had a cough
					for above 3 months upon me, wch is incurable.</p>
