            <p>William Shakespeare <lb/> To Mrs Anne, Regular Servant <lb/> to the Revd Mr Precentor <lb/> of York.
					</p>
            <p>A MOMENT'S patience, gentle Mistris Anne! <lb/> (But stint your clack for sweet St Charitie) <lb/> 'Tis Willy begs, once a right
						proper Man, <lb/> Tho' now a Book, and interleav'd, you see. </p>
            <p>Much have I born from canker'd Critick's spite,<lb/> From fumbling Baronets, and Poets small,<lb/> Pert Barristers, &amp; Parsons nothing bright:
						<lb/> But, what awaits me now, is worst of all!
					</p>
            <p>'Tis true, our Master's temper natural <lb/> Was fashion'd fair in meek &amp; dovelike
						guise:<lb/> But may not honey's self be turn'd to gall <lb/> By residence, by marriage, &amp; sore eyes?
					</p>
            <p>If then he wreak on me his wicked will: <lb/> Steal to his closet at the hour of prayer, <lb/> And (when thou hear'st the organ
						piping shrill) <lb/> Grease his best pen, &amp; all he scribbles, tear. </p>
            <p>Better to bottom tarts &amp; cheesecakes nice, <lb/> Better the roast-meat from the fire to save, <lb/> Better be twisted into
						caps for spice, <lb/> Than thus be patch'd, &amp; cobbled in one's grave! </p>
            <p>So York shall taste, what ClouÃ«t never knew;<lb/> So from <hi rend="italic">our</hi> works
						sublimer fumes shall rise:<lb/> While Nancy earns the praise to Shakespear due <lb/> For glorious puddings, &amp; immortal pies.
					</p>
         </q>
         <p>Tell me, if you don't like this, &amp; I will send you a worse. I rejoice to hear, your eyes are better as much, as if they were my
					own: but the cure will never be lasting without a little sea. I have been for two days at Hartlepool
					to tast the water, &amp; do assure you, nothing can be salter, &amp; bitterer, &amp; nastier, &amp;
					better for you. they have a most antiscorbutic flavour. I am delighted with the place: there are the finest walks &amp; rocks &amp;
					caverns, &amp; dried fishes, &amp; all manner of small inconveniences a Man can wish. I am going again this week to wait your
					commands.</p>
         <p>Dr Wharton would be quite happy to see you at Old-Park. if you should have kindness &amp; resignation enough to come, you must get to
					Darlington, then turn off the great road to Merrington, then enquire the way to Spenny-more House,
					where they will direct you hither.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu! I am ever<lb/> Yours </salute>
