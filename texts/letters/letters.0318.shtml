      <p>Dear Mason I was just leaving Cambridge<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at the time, when I received your last letter, &amp; have been unfix'd &amp; flitting about
         almost eversince, or you had heard of me sooner. you do not think I could stay to
         receive Fobus. no more did Mr. H:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he was gone into Leicestershire<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> long before; as to Uncle B:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> pray do him justice. he stay'd indeed to preach the Commencement-Sermon, but he assured
         me (in secret) it was an old one, &amp; had not one word in it <span style="font-style:italic">to the purpose.</span> the very next morning he set out for Winchester,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; I do really think him much improved since he had his residence there, freer &amp; more
         open, &amp; his heart less set upon the Mammon of unrighteousness. a-propos, would you
         think it, Fobus has wit. he told Y:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (who was invited to supper at Dr L:s,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; made all the company wait for him), 'Why, Y:e, you make but an aukward figure,
         now you are a Bp; this time last year you would have been the first man here.'</p>
      <p>I can not brag of my spirits, my situation, my employments, or my fertility. the days
         &amp; the nights pass, &amp; I am never the nearer to any thing but that one, to wch we are
         all tending. yet I love People, that leave some traces of their journey behind them,
         &amp; have strength enough to advise you to do so, while you can. I expect to see Caractacus
         compleated, not so much from the opinion I entertain of your industry, as from the
         consideration that another winter approaches, which is the season of harvest to an
         Author; but I will conceal the secret of your motives, &amp; join in the common applause.
         the books you enquire after are not worth your knowledge. Parnell<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is the dunghill of Irish-Grubstreet. I did hear, who L:t Temple<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was, but have really forgot: I know, I thought it was Mr Greville.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Avon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is nothing but a Type. the Dss of Queensberry's Advertisement<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has moved my impatience, yet after all perhaps she may curl her grey hair with her
         Grandfather's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> golden periods. another object of my wishes is the K: of Prussia's Account of the
         Campaign,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch Niphausen<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> talk'd of 6 weeks ago, as just coming over, but it is not come: perhaps he waits
         for a better Catastrophe. the Twickenham-Press is in labour of two or three works<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (not of the Printer's own) one of them is an Account of Russia by a Lord Whitworth,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who (I think) was Minister there from King William.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I seem to have told you all I know, wch you will think very little, but <span style="font-style:italic">a nihilo nil fit.</span> if I were to coin my whole mind into phrases, they would profit you nothing, nor
         fill a moderate page: compassionate my poverty, shew yourself noble in giving me better
         than I bring, &amp; ever believe me</p>
