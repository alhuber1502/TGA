      <p>Dear Mason I was just leaving Cambridge at the time, when I received your last letter,
         &amp; have been unfix'd &amp; flitting about almost eversince, or you had heard of me sooner.
         you do not think I could stay to receive Fobus. no more did Mr. H: he was gone into
         Leicestershire long before; as to Uncle B: pray do him justice. he stay'd indeed to
         preach the Commencement-Sermon, but he assured me (in secret) it was an old one, &amp;
         had not one word in it <span style="font-style:italic">to the purpose.</span> the very next morning he set out for Winchester, &amp; I do really think him much improved
         since he had his residence there, freer &amp; more open, &amp; his heart less set upon the
         Mammon of unrighteousness. a-propos, would you think it, Fobus has wit. he told Y:
         (who was invited to supper at Dr L:s, &amp; made all the company wait for him), 'Why,
         Y:e, you make but an aukward figure, now you are a Bp; this time last year you would
         have been the first man here.'
      </p>
      <p>I can not brag of my spirits, my situation, my employments, or my fertility. the days
         &amp; the nights pass, &amp; I am never the nearer to any thing but that one, to wch we are
         all tending. yet I love People, that leave some traces of their journey behind them,
         &amp; have strength enough to advise you to do so, while you can. I expect to see Caractacus
         compleated, not so much from the opinion I entertain of your industry, as from the
         consideration that another winter approaches, which is the season of harvest to an
         Author; but I will conceal the secret of your motives, &amp; join in the common applause.
         the books you enquire after are not worth your knowledge. Parnell is the dunghill
         of Irish-Grubstreet. I did hear, who L:t Temple was, but have really forgot: I know,
         I thought it was Mr Greville. Avon is nothing but a Type. the Dss of Queensberry's
         Advertisement has moved my impatience, yet after all perhaps she may curl her grey
         hair with her Grandfather's golden periods. another object of my wishes is the K:
         of Prussia's Account of the Campaign, wch Niphausen talk'd of 6 weeks ago, as just
         coming over, but it is not come: perhaps he waits for a better Catastrophe. the Twickenham-Press
         is in labour of two or three works (not of the Printer's own) one of them is an Account
         of Russia by a Lord Whitworth, who (I think) was Minister there from King William.
      </p>
      <p>I seem to have told you all I know, wch you will think very little, but <span style="font-style:italic">a nihilo nil fit.</span> if I were to coin my whole mind into phrases, they would profit you nothing, nor
         fill a moderate page: compassionate my poverty, shew yourself noble in giving me better
         than I bring, &amp; ever believe me
      </p>

         <p>I find you miss'd of St: by going to Sr C: D'arcy's. can you tell me, if he is still
            at Harrowgate, for I do not know how to direct to him there.
