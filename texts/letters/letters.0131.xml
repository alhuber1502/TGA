				     <p>What do You chuse I should think of a whole Year's Silence? have you absolutely forgot me, or do you not reflect, that it is from
					yourself alone I can have any Information concerning You? I do not find myself inclined to forget you: the same Regard for your Person,
					the same Desire of seeing you again I felt when we parted still continues with me as fresh as ever. don't wonder then if in spite of
					Appearances I try to flatter myself with the Hopes of finding Sentiments something of the same kind however buried in some dark Corner
					of your Heart, &amp; perhaps more than half extinguish'd by long Absence, &amp; various Cares of a different Nature. I will not alarm
					your Indolence with a long Letter. my Demands are only three, &amp; may be answer'd in as many Words. how You do? where You are? &amp;
					When You return? if you chuse to add anything further it will be a Work of Superer â€“ I will not write so long a Word entire,
					least I fatigue your Delicacy, &amp; you may think it incumbent on you to answer it by another of equal Dimensions. You believe me, I
					hope, with great Sincerity Yours </p>

					       <p>PS: For ought I know You may be in England. my very true Compliments (not such as People make to one another) wait upon Mr
							Whithed. he will be the most travel'd Gentleman in Hampshire.</p>
