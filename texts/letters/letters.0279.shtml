         <div class="salute">Dear Sir </div>
      </div>
      <p>I give you many thanks for the favour of your Odes, which I have received after a
         tedious expectation. You may be sure the title-page amused us a good deal, but M<span class="super">r</span> Brown has explained it.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> It is not worth while to tell you how they are received here. But every body would
         be thought to admire. 'Tis true, I believe, the greater part don't understand them.</p>
      <p>I have been amusing myself in my way, since you left us. The Letter to Mason<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is printed off, and I shall send you a copy very soon to Dodsley's. The dialogues<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> too are all finished after a sort; so that I shall have work enough for you against
         our next meeting in November. I should be better pleased if you would find work for
         me. And I hope you don't forget, among your other amusements this summer, your design
         for a history of the English poetry. You might be regulating your plan, and digesting
         the materials you have by you.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I shall teaze you perpetually, till you set about the project in good earnest. It
         is a wonderful favourite with me, and will, I am certain, in your hands be a work
         of much use as well as elegance.</p>
      <p>Mason has never once writ in all this time, which I take prodigiously ill, and desire
         you will tell him so. D<span class="super">r</span> Warburton sends me word too, he did not keep his appointment with him of going to
         Durham. So that I can only conclude he is laid up of a fit of the Muse, or perhaps
         is gone to pay a visit to his Druids at Mona.</p>
      <p>If you give me the pleasure of hearing from you, you must write very soon. For I grow
         sick of this place, and set out on the 29<span class="super">th</span> on my summer rambles. It will be a satisfaction to hear that you are well. I am sollicitous
         for nothing else. For you can never want the best sort of amusements. Once more, let
         me thank you for the Odes, which I like the better upon every reading. M<span class="super">r</span> Nevile<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> too desires me to make his acknowledgments in full form. He is mightily flatter'd
         with the Present you was so kind to make him.</p>
