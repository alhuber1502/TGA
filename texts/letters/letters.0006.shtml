      <p>After having been very piously at St Mary's church yesterday; as I was coming home;
         somebody told me, that you was come, &amp; that your Servant had been to enquire for me:
         whereupon throwing off all the Pruderie &amp; Reserve of a Cambridge Student, in a great
         extasie, I run in a vast hurry to set the Bells a-ringing, &amp; kindle a thousand Bonfires–when
         amidst these Convulsions of Joy, I was stopt by one of our Colledge, who inform'd
         me, that a fine Gentleman in a laced hat &amp; scarlet Stockings wanted me: so, you may
         conclude, as soon as I set eyes on him, I was ready to eat him for having your Livery
         on; but he soon checked me by acquainting me 'twas not You, that was come; but–Your
         Service: now undoubtedly after being so terribly bauked; one could not have lived,
         but by the help of Hartshorn, Hungary-Water,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; your Journal, which gives one a greater Flow of Spirits, than ei[ther of them.]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> [but, dear Celadon],<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> nothing gave me half so much pleasure, as to find; that after the toil of the day
         was over, you could be so good as to throw away a moment in thinking of me, &amp; had
         Spirits enough left, to make all the hideosities you underwent agreable by describing
         them: – by all that's frightful, I was in agonies for you, when I saw you planted
         at the upper end of a Table so elegantly set out; like the King of Monsters in the
         Fairy-tales: never was any one's curiosity half so much raised by a blot, as mine
         is by that in your Diary: 'tis so judicious a Scratch, so genteel a Blurr, that I
         shall never be easy, till I know what it conceals; no more than I shall be, till I
         receive the things that are to come by word of mouth, wch (if 'twere possible) would
         make me wish to see you more than ever: <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> sure West is as much improved as he says<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Plato<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is; since you could have the conscience to persuade him to come to Cambridge<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>[...]</p>
