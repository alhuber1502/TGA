      <p>I am very sorry that the haste I made to deliver you from your uneasiness the first
         moment after I received your Letter, shoud have made me express myself in a manner
         to have the quite contrary effect from what I intended. You well know how rapidly
         and carelessly I always write my Letters; the note<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you mention was written in a still greater hurry than ordinary, &amp; merely to put you
         out of pain. I had not seen Dodsley, consequently coud only tell you that I did not
         doubt but he woud have no Objection to satisfy you, as you was willing to prevent
         his being a Loser by the plate.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Now, from this declaration how is it possible for you to have for one moment put
         such a construction upon my words, as woud have been a downright stupid brutality,
         unprovoked? It is impossible for me to recollect my very expression, but I am confident
         that I have repeated the whole substance.</p>
      <p>How the bookseller woud be less a Loser by being at more expense, I can easily explain
         to you: He feared the price of half a guinea woud seem too high to most purchasers;
         if by the expence of ten guineas more he coud make the book appear so much more rich
         &amp; showy (as I beleive I said) as to induce people to think it cheap, the profits from
         selling many more copies woud amply recompense him for his additional disbursement.
         </p>
      <p>The thought of having the head engraved was entirely Dodsley's own, &amp; against my opinion,
         as I concluded it woud be against yours, which made me determine to acquaint you with
         it before it's appearance. </p>
      <p>When you reflect on what I have said now, you will see very clearly, that I had &amp;
         coud have no other possible meaning in what I wrote last. you might justly have accused
         me of neglect, if I had deferr'd giving you all the satisfaction in my power, as soon
         as ever I knew your uneasiness. </p>
      <p>The Head I give up. The Title I think will be wrong, &amp; not answer your purpose, for,
         as the Drawings are evidently calculated for the poems, why will the improper disposition
         of the Word <span style="font-style:italic">Designs</span> before <span style="font-style:italic">Poems,</span> make the Edition less yours? I am as little convinced that there is any affectation
         in leaving out the <span style="font-style:italic">Mr</span> before your Names; it is a barbarous addition; the other is simple &amp; classic, a rank
         I cannot help thinking due to both the Poet and Painter. Without ranging myself among
         Classics, I assure you, were I to print any thing with my name, it shoud be plain
         Horace Walpole: <span style="font-style:italic">Mr</span> is one of the Gothicisms I abominate.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> The Explanation<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was certainly added for people who have not Eyes – such are almost all who have seen
         Mr Bentley's drawings, &amp; think to compliment him by mistaking them for prints. Alas!
         the generality want as much to have the words <span style="font-style:italic">a Man, a Cock,</span> written under his drawings, as under the most execrable hieroglyphics of Egypt or
         of sign post painters!</p>
      <p>I will say no more now, but that you must not wonder if I am partial to you &amp; yours,
         when you can write as you do &amp; yet feel so little Vanity. I have used freedoms enough
         with your writings to convince you I speak truth: I praise &amp; scold Mr Bentley immoderately
         as I think he draws well or ill; I never think it worth my while to do either, especially
         to blame, where there are not generally vast Excellencies. goodnight – dont suspect
         me when I have no fault but impatience to make you easy. </p>
