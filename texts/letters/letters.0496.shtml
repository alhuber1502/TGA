      <p>All this time have I been waiting to say something to the purpose, &amp; now am just as
         far off as at first. Stuart appointed Mr Weddell an hour, when I was to meet him,
         &amp; (after staying an infinite while at his lodgings in expectation) he never came:
         indeed he was gone out of Town. the <span style="font-style:italic">drawing</span> &amp; your <span style="font-style:italic">questions</span> remain in Weddell's hands to be shew'd to this Rogue, as soon as he can meet with
         him: but I firmly believe, when he has got them, he will do nothing. so you must tell
         me, what I am to do with them. I have shew'd the Epitaph to no one but Hurd, who entirely
         approves it. he made no objection, but to one line (&amp; that was mine) <span style="font-style:italic">Heav'n lifts</span> &amp;c: so if you please to make another, you may: for my part I rather like it still.
      </p>
      <p>I begin to think of drawing northwards (if my wretched matters will let me) &amp; am going
         to write to Mr Brown about it. you are to consider, whether you will be able or willing
         to receive us at Aston about a fortnight hence, or whether we are to find you at York,
         where I suppose you to be at present. this you will let me know soon, &amp; if I am disappointed,
         I will tell you in time. you will tell me, what to do with your <span style="font-style:italic">Zumpe,</span>  wch has amused me much here. if you would have it sent down, I had better commit
         it to its Maker, who will tune it &amp; pack it up. Dr Long has bought the fellow to it.
         the base is not quite of a piece with the treble, &amp; the higher notes are somewhat
         dry &amp; sticky: the rest discourses very eloquent musick.
