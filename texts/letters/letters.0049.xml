         <p>I am in good hopes, that by this time the Eclipse is over with you, &amp; that your two Satellit's
					have recover'd their usual light; the Sublimity of which two metaphors, after you have taken them out of their pantoufles, &amp; reduced 'em to their just value, will be found to amount to my wishes for your health, &amp; that of
					your eyes, whose warmth I have been too sensible of, when they used to shine upon me, not to be very apprehensive of any damage that
					might befall 'em: I should have taken care to write upon Green paper, &amp; dip'd my Pen in Copperas-water, if you had not assured me,
					that they were on the mending hand, &amp; pretty well able to sustain the whitemaking rays: now as for the transactions here, you are
					to be ascertain'd; that the Man at the Mitre has cut his throat, that one Mr White of Emanuel a week
					ago drown'd himself, but since that has been seen a few miles of, having the appearance of one that had never been drown'd; wherefore
					it is by many conjectured, that he walketh: Dr Bouquets verses have been return'd by Mr
						Vice-chancellour to undergo several corrections; the old Man's invention is much [admired as] having found out a way to make bawdy verses upon a Burying: the wind was so
					high last night, that I every minute expected to pay you a visit at London perforce, which was the
					place I certainly should have directed the storm to, if I had been obliged to ride in the Whirlwind:
					if I don't hear from you this week, I shall be in a thousand Tyrrit's &amp; frights about you;</p>
