         <p>I am sincerely pleased with every mark of your kindness, &amp; as such I look upon your last letter in particular. I feel for the
					sorrow you have felt, &amp; yet I can not wish to lessen it: that would be to rob you of the best part of your nature, to efface from
					your mind the tender memory of a Father's love, &amp; deprive the Dead of that just &amp; grateful
					tribute wch his goodness demanded from you.</p>
         <p>I must however remind you, how happy it was for him, that you were with him to the last; that he was sensible perhaps of your care,
					when every other sense was vanishingâ€“he might have lost you last year, might have seen you go
					before him at a time, when all the ills of helpless old-age were coming upon him, &amp; (tho' not destitute of the attention &amp;
					tenderness of others) yet destitute of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> attention &amp; <hi rend="italic">your</hi> tenderness. May God
					preserve you my best Friend! &amp; (Long after my eyes are closed) give you that last satisfaction in the gratitude &amp; affection of
					a Son, wch you have given your Father.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>I am ever <lb/> Most truly &amp; entirely <lb/> Yours </salute>
