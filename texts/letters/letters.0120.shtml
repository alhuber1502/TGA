      <p>To begin with the conclusion of your letter, which is Greek, I desire that you will
         quarrel no more with your manner of passing your time. In my opinion it is irreproachable,
         especially as it produces such excellent fruit; and if I, like a saucy bird, must
         be pecking at it, you ought to consider that it is because I like it. No una litura
         I beg you, no unravelling of your web, dear Sir! only pursue it a little further,
         and then one shall be able to judge of it a little better. You know the crisis of
         a play is in the first act; its damnation or salvation wholly rests there. But till
         that first act is over, every body suspends his vote; so how do you think I can form,
         as yet, any just idea of the speeches in regard to their length or shortness? The
         connexion and symmetry of such little parts with one another must naturally escape
         me, as not having the plan of the whole in my head; neither can I decide about the
         thoughts whether they are wrong or superfluous; they may have some future tendency
         which I perceive not. The style only was free to me, and there I find we are pretty
         much of the same sentiment: For you say the affectation of imitating Shakespear may
         doubtless be carried too far; I say as much and no more. For old words we know are
         old gold, provided they are well chosen. Whatever Ennius was, I do not consider Shakespear
         as a dunghill in the least: On the contrary, he is a mine of antient ore, where all
         our great modern poets have found their advantage. I do not know how it is, but his
         old expressions have more energy in them than ours, and are even more adapted to poetry;
         certainly, where they are judiciously and sparingly inserted, they add a certain grace
         to the composition; in the same manner as Poussin gave a beauty to his pictures by
         his knowledge in the antient proportions: But should he, or any other painter, carry
         the imitation too far, and neglect that best of models Nature, I am afraid it would
         prove a very flat performance. To finish this long criticism: I have this further
         notion about old words revived, (is not this a pretty way of finishing?) I think them
         of excellent use in tales; they add a certain drollery to the comic, and a romantic
         gravity to the serious, which are both charming in their kind; and this way of charming
         Dryden understood very well. One need only read Milton to acknowledge the dignity
         they give the Epic. But now comes my opinion that they ought to be used in Tragedy
         more sparingly, than in most kinds of poetry. Tragedy is designed for public representation,
         and what is designed for that should certainly be most intelligible. I believe half
         the audience that come to Shakespear's plays do not understand the half of what they
         hear.–But finissons enfin.–Yet one word more.–You think the ten or twelve first lines
         the best, now I am for the fourteen last; add, that they contain not one word of antientry.

      <p>I rejoice you found amusement in Joseph Andrews. But then I think your conceptions
         of Paradise a little upon the Bergerac. Les Lettres du Seraphim R. a Madame la Cherubinesse
         de Q. What a piece of extravagance would there be!
      </p>
      <p>And now you must know that my body continues weak and enervate. And for my animal
         spirits, they are in perpetual fluctuation: Some whole days I have no relish, no attention
         for any thing; at other times I revive, and am capable of writing a long letter, as
         you see; and though I do not write speeches, yet I translate them. When you understand
         what speech, you will own that it is a bold and perhaps a dull attempt. In three words,
         it is prose, it is from Tacitus, it is of Germanicus. Peruse, perpend, pronounce.
