         <div class="salute">Dear Mr Gray–</div>
      </div>
      <p>Stonhewer has this post recd yours but you tifft at him so much in a former Letter<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that you are not to wonder he is so backward in answering it. however he means to
         write to you if he survives the next subscription Masquerade for the superb Garniture
         of wch the Adelphi<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are now exerting all their powers. Lovatini<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> cant sing for them to morrow. &amp; it is thought Mrs Cornelys<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> will be happy if they allow her a third underground floor in Durham yard<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to hide her diminishd head in. Well! &amp; so the great State secret<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is out, that I and the King knew so well two Months ago. But it may be well to inform
         you &amp; such rusticated folks as you, that it is not my friend the Surveyor Jackson
         of Hornby Castle who is sub præceptor But a Jackson of Christ Church.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> My Unkle Powel<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> may bless his stars that he<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is removd to Court. For he read such wonderfull Mathematical Lectures there; that
         if he had gone on a few years longer it is thought St Johns would have been eclipsd
         by the glories of Peckwater.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that Peckwater wch, in the days of Roger Parne<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was fain to bow even to Trinity. Then what say you of Mr. Smelt<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> –is it not a proof <span style="font-style:italic">that patient Merit will buoy up at last</span>?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> In a word did you ever see an <span style="font-style:italic">arrangement</span> formd upon a more liberal &amp; unministerial <span style="font-style:italic">ground.</span> To say nothing of the Governor himself, what think you of the Præceptor?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> could any thing be more to yours &amp; Lord Mansfields mind? Pray let me know if the
         New married Stephen<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> chuses to be seller of mild &amp; stale to his royal highness<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> because I would put his name on the List of the Expectants I am to apply for, if
         agreable. I have a Baker a Locksmith a Drawing Master a Laundress an Archbishops cast-off
         groom of the Chamber already upon my hands. You must speak in time if you would have
         any thing. not that I beleive there will [be]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a household these several years, even if we were rich enough to pay for one. Lord
         J<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> blabbd to Jack Dixon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that Dr Hurd refusd,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; he blabbd it to Gould,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who will blab it to all the University &amp; we shall be quite shent. Tell Gould if he
         Says a Word That Oddyngton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> may again become vacant &amp; I shall certainly serve him as I servd him before. Now
         I thought that Jack Dixon would have been at Petersburg before he could tell it to
         any body &amp; I did not much mind whether the Czarina knew it or no. for I know shell
         get out all Jacks secrets in some of their amorous moments. But here am I writing
         nonsence when I should be thanking you seriously for Your £100 &amp; sending you your
         security. Voila Donc! here it is. tear [it off and put it in your]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> strong box.</p>
      <p>You say nothing of coming up, &amp; Palgrave affects not to come up till the beginning
         of May I will press neither of you. I know you both too well. As to myself I mean
         to fly northward by the way of Northamptonshire &amp; poor Hoyland<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> </p>

      <p> but as it snows at present you will think perhaps to find me here in June. &amp; perhaps
         you may–well do your pleasure &amp; beleive me</p>
