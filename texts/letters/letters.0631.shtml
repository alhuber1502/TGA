         <div class="salute">Dear Mr Gray–</div>
      </div>
      <p>Stonhewer has this post recd yours but you tifft at him so much in a former Letter
         that you are not to wonder he is so backward in answering it. however he means to
         write to you if he survives the next subscription Masquerade for the superb Garniture
         of wch the Adelphi are now exerting all their powers. Lovatini cant sing for them
         to morrow. &amp; it is thought Mrs Cornelys will be happy if they allow her a third underground
         floor in Durham yard to hide her diminishd head in. Well! &amp; so the great State secret
         is out, that I and the King knew so well two Months ago. But it may be well to inform
         you &amp; such rusticated folks as you, that it is not my friend the Surveyor Jackson
         of Hornby Castle who is sub præceptor But a Jackson of Christ Church. My Unkle Powel
         may bless his stars that he is removd to Court. For he read such wonderfull Mathematical
         Lectures there; that if he had gone on a few years longer it is thought St Johns would
         have been eclipsd by the glories of Peckwater. that Peckwater wch, in the days of
         Roger Parne was fain to bow even to Trinity. Then what say you of Mr. Smelt –is it
         not a proof <span style="font-style:italic">that patient Merit will buoy up at last</span>? In a word did you ever see an <span style="font-style:italic">arrangement</span> formd upon a more liberal &amp; unministerial <span style="font-style:italic">ground.</span> To say nothing of the Governor himself, what think you of the Præceptor? could any
         thing be more to yours &amp; Lord Mansfields mind? Pray let me know if the New married
         Stephen chuses to be seller of mild &amp; stale to his royal highness because I would
         put his name on the List of the Expectants I am to apply for, if agreable. I have
         a Baker a Locksmith a Drawing Master a Laundress an Archbishops cast-off groom of
         the Chamber already upon my hands. You must speak in time if you would have any thing.
         not that I beleive there will [be] a household these several years, even if we were
         rich enough to pay for one. Lord J blabbd to Jack Dixon that Dr Hurd refusd, &amp; he
         blabbd it to Gould, who will blab it to all the University &amp; we shall be quite shent.
         Tell Gould if he Says a Word That Oddyngton may again become vacant &amp; I shall certainly
         serve him as I servd him before. Now I thought that Jack Dixon would have been at
         Petersburg before he could tell it to any body &amp; I did not much mind whether the Czarina
         knew it or no. for I know shell get out all Jacks secrets in some of their amorous
         moments. But here am I writing nonsence when I should be thanking you seriously for
         Your £100 &amp; sending you your security. Voila Donc! here it is. tear [it off and put
         it in your] strong box.
      </p>
      <p>You say nothing of coming up, &amp; Palgrave affects not to come up till the beginning
         of May I will press neither of you. I know you both too well. As to myself I mean
         to fly northward by the way of Northamptonshire &amp; poor Hoyland

      <p> but as it snows at present you will think perhaps to find me here in June. &amp; perhaps
         you may–well do your pleasure &amp; beleive me
