      </div>
      <p>Excuse me, if I begin to wonder a little, that I have heard no news of you in so long
         a time. I conclude, you received Dodsley's packet at least a week ago, &amp; made my presents.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you will not wonder therefore at my curiosity, if I enquire of you, what you hear
         said? for tho' in the rest of the world I do not expect to hear, that any body says
         much, or thinks about the matter yet among <span style="font-style:italic">mes Confreres,</span> the Learned, I know there is alway leisure at least to find fault, if not to commend.
      </p>
      <p>I have been lately much out of order; &amp; confined at home, but now I go abroad again.
         Mr Garrick &amp; his Wife have pass'd some days at my Lady Cobham's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; are shortly to return again; they &amp; a few other people, that I see there, have
         been my only entertainment till this week: but now I have purchased some volumes of
         the Great French Encyclopedie,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; am trying to amuse myself within doors.
      </p>
