					       <salute>My dear Wharton</salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I highly approve of your travelling Nuptials, &amp; only wonder you don't set forth on Easter-Day,
					rather than stay to be dish'd up there, &amp; put to Bed by a whole Heap of prurient Relations. I don't conceive what one can do with
					such People, but run away from them. my very Letter blushes to think it must speak with you at a Time when there is but one Person you
					can properly have any Thing to say to.</p>
				     <p>However, tho' I have not the Pleasure of knowing Mr Wilkinson, my new Relation, much less of
					knowing how good a Charioteer he is: yet I will readily trust him with my Neck to carry to Stilton,
					or where he pleases. if I arrive there in a shatter'd Condition, I hope the Lady you belong to will receive me the more graciously, as
					a Person, that had an Ambition to break a Limb, or two in her Service. but you must desire him (as you say) to invite me.</p>
				     <p>You shall receive the Money, as soon as you get to Town. my Aunt
					has it in her Hands: when I see you, I shall learn your Direction, &amp; she shall come &amp; pay it. I won't trouble you with long
					Letters at present. </p>
