            <salute>Good Sr </salute>

         <p>I am at last return'd to my old Squirrel's nest from the Highlands, wch would be Italy, if they had but a climate, &amp; even that
					was not wanting for the few days I pass'd among them. there it is, that the beauties of Scotland lie hid. of the Lowlands, wch every
					true Scotsman celebrates as a Paradise, I shall only say, they are better than Northumberland (don't
					tell Mr Delaval) &amp; the nearer they come to the Mountains the better they grow. I return'd by Stirling, being a foe to
						drowning (tho' it be 35 miles about) to Edinburgh, &amp; from thence to Old Park, where after a
					fortnight's repose leaving the good family in a hopeful way to increase, &amp; charged with many
					civilities to you &amp; <hi rend="italic">fruitless</hi> invitations I got in three days (including nights) to London. the particulars of my travels I must defer, till I see you, when we shall have many chapters to treat. I
					did not visit the new-married couple, because he prohibited me to touch his Wife, wch is a distinction reserved for you.</p>
         <p>The night after I arrived, the D: of Cumberland died. the preceding night he pass'd at Windsor,
					&amp; meant to be at Court in the morning, but overslept himself &amp; came too late to Town. between 7 &amp; 8 he found his usual
					Asthma more troublesome than ordinary, &amp; going to a window threw it up for air. after a few minutes he said it was too cold for
					him, complain'd of a shivering &amp; an uncommon sensation in his arms, &amp; desired to be help'd to a couch. he was immediately
					bloodied, &amp; then throwing himself back said <hi rend="italic">it was all over: they could do him no good,</hi> &amp; expired
					instantly. there was to be a Cabinet-council that night at his house, &amp; three of them were just then arrived. I do not hear, that
					this event will make any present alteration in Men or measures. the D: of N: cries his eyes out,
					&amp; will not be comforted: so you must do so too, 
					 but have a care you don't do it in earnest.
				</p>
         <p>Adieu, Dear Sr, I should be glad, you would send me the <hi rend="italic">Sum Total</hi> of my bill, &amp; the novelties of Cambridge of wch all I know is, that poor Lobb is dead. where is the
						AbbÃ©, &amp; what does he say &amp; do? Ld St: wonders, he never
					answer'd his letter of invitation.</p>
