				     <p>Elfrida (for that is the fair one's name) and her author are now in town together. He has promised
					me, that he will send a part of it to you some morning while he is there; and (if you shall think it worth while to descend to
					particulars) I should be glad you would tell me very freely your opinion about it; for he shall know nothing of the matter, that is not
					fit for the ears of a <hi rend="italic">tender</hi> parentâ€“though, by the way, he has ingenuity and merit enough (whatever his
					drama may have) to bear hearing his faults very patiently. I must only beg you not to show it, much less let it be copied; for it will
					be published, though not as yet.</p>
				     <p> I do not expect any more editions, as I have appeared in more magazines than one. The chief errata were <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> bower for <hi rend="italic">secret</hi>;
					<hi rend="italic">hidden</hi> for <hi rend="italic">kindred</hi>
					 (in spite of dukes and classicks); and <hi rend="italic">frowning</hi> as in scorn for <hi rend="italic">smiling.</hi>
					 I humbly propose, for the benefit of Mr. Dodsley and his matrons, that take <hi rend="italic">awake</hi>
					 for a verb, that they should read <hi rend="italic">asleep,</hi> and all will be right. Gil
						Blas is the Lying Valet in five acts. The Fine Lady has half-a-dozen good lines dispersed in it. Pompey is the hasty production of a Mr. Coventry (cousin to him you knew), a young clergyman: I found it out by three
					characters, which once made part of a comedy that he showed me of his own writing. Has that miracle of <hi rend="italic">tenderness and
						sensibility</hi> (as she calls it) lady Vane given you any amusement? Peregrine, whom she uses as a
					vehicle, is very poor indeed with a few exceptions. In the last volume is a character of Mr. Lyttelton, under the name of Gosling
					Scrag, and a parody of part of his Monody, under the notion of a pastoral on the death of his
					grandmother.</p>
