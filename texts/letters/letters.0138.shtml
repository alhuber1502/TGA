         <div class="salute">My Dear Wharton</div>
      </div>
      <p>I am just returned hither from Town, where I have past better than a Fortnight, (including
         an Excursion that I made to Hampton Court, Richmond, Greenwich &amp; other Places) &amp; am
         happily met by a letter from You, [one from Tuthill], &amp; another from Trollope. as
         I only run over Dr Andrew's Answers hastily in a Coffee House, all I could judge was
         that they seem'd very unfavourable on the whole to our Cause, &amp; threw every thing
         into the Hands of a Visitour, for wch Reason I thought they might have been conceal'd,
         till the Attorney-General's Opinion arrived, wch will perhaps raise the Spirits of
         such, as the other may have damp'd a little; or leave Room at least to doubt whether
         the Matter be so clear on the Master's Side as Andrew would have it. You can't suppose,
         that I was in the least uneasy about Mr Brown's Fortitude, who wants nothing, but
         a Foot in height &amp; his own Hair, to make him a little old Roman: with two dozen such
         I should not hesitate to face an Army of Heads, tho' they were all as tall as Dr Adams.
         I only wish every body may continue in as good a Disposition as they were; &amp; imagine,
         if possible, Roger will be Fool enough to keep them so. I saw Trollope for about an
         Hour in London; &amp; imagineing he could not be left in the dark as to your Consultations,
         I mention'd, that I had cast an Eye over Andrew's Paper, &amp; that it was not so favourable
         as we hoped. he spoke however with Horrour of going to Law; with great Passion of
         the Master; &amp; with Pleasure of himself for quitting a Place, where he had not found
         a Minute's Ease in I know not how long: yet I perceive his Thoughts run on nothing
         else, &amp; he trembled while he spoke. he writes to me here on the same Subject; &amp; after
         abusing Roger, he adds, Whartoni rubro hæc subscribe libello.
      </p>
      <p>My Evenings have been chiefly spent at Ranelagh &amp; Vaux-Hall, several of my Mornings,
         or rather Noons, in Arlington-Street, &amp; the rest at the Tryal of the Lords. the first
         Day I was not there, &amp; only saw the Ld High-Steward's Parade in going: the second
         &amp; third  [... Peers were all in their Robes ... by their wearing Bag-Wigs &amp; Hats instead
         of Coronets. My Lord H: Steward  was the least part] of the Shew, as he wore only
         his Baron's Robe, &amp; was always asking the Heralds what he should do next, &amp; bowing
         or smileing about to his Acquaintance. as to his Speech you see it; People hold it
         very cheap, tho' several Incorrectnesses have been alter'd in the printed Copy. Kilmarnoch
         spoke in Mitigation of his Crime near half an Hour with a decent Courage, &amp; in a strong,
         but pathetic, Voice. his Figure would prejudice people in his Favour being tall &amp;
         genteel: he is upwards of 40, but to the Eye not above 35 Years of Age. what he said
         appears to less Advantage, when read. Cromartie (who is about the same Age a Man of
         lower Stature, but much like a Gentleman) was sinking into the Earth with Grief &amp;
         Dejection. with Eyes cast down &amp; a Voice so low, that no one heard a Syllable, that
         did not sit close to the Bar, he made a short Speech to raise Compassion. it is now,
         I see, printed; &amp; is reckon'd extremely fine. I believe, you will think it touching
         &amp; well-expressed: if there be any Meanness in it, it is lost in that Sorrow he gives
         us for so numerous &amp; helpless a Family. Lady-Cromartie (who is said to have drawn
         her Husband into these Circumstances) was at Leicester-House on Wednesday with four
         of her Children; the Princess saw her, &amp; made no other answer than by bringing in
         her own Children &amp; placeing them by her; wch (if true) is one of the prettiest Things
         I ever heard. she was also at the Duke's, who refused to admit her: but she waited
         till he came to his Coach &amp; threw herself at his Knees, while her Children hung upon
         him, till he promised her all his Interest could do; &amp; before on several Occasions
         he has been heard to speak very mildly of Cromartie, &amp; very severely of Kilmarnoch.
         so if any be spared, it will probably be the former, tho' he had a pension of 600£
         a-Year from the Government, &amp; the Order for giveing Quarter to no Englishman was found
         in his Pocket. as to Balmerino he never had any Hopes from the Beginning: he is an
         old soldier-like Man of a vulgar Manner &amp; Aspect, speaks the broadest Scotch, &amp; shews
         an Intrepidity, that some ascribe to real Courage, &amp; some to Brandy.

      <p>You have heard perhaps, that the first Day (while the Peers were adjourned to consider
         of his Plea, &amp; he left alone for an Hour &amp; half in the Bar) he diverted himself with
         the Ax, that stood by him, played with its Tassels &amp; tryed the Edge with his Finger:
         &amp; some Lord, as he passed by him, saying he was surprised to hear him alledge anything
         so frivolous, &amp; that could not possibly do him the least Service: he answer'd, that
         as there were so many Ladies present, he thought it would be uncivil to give them
         no Amusement. the D: of Argyle telling him how sorry &amp; how astonish'd he was to see
         him engaged in such a Cause. My Lord (says he) for the two Kings &amp; their Rights I
         cared not a Farthing, wch prevailed: but I was starveing; &amp; by God if Mahomet had
         set up his Standard in the Highlands, I had been a good Musselman for Bread, &amp; stuck
         close to the Party, for I must eat. the Sollicitor-General came up to speak to him
         too; &amp; he turns about to old Williamson. Who is that Lawyer, that talks to me? My
         Ld, it is Mr Murray. Ha! Mr Murray, my good Friend (says he, &amp; shook him by the Hand)
         &amp; how does your good Mother? oh, she was of admirable Service to us; we should have
         done nothing without her in Perthshire. he recommends (he says) his Peggy ('tis uncertain
         ... the Favour of the Government, for she has ...
      </p>
      <p>[I have been diverted with an Account of old Lovat  in his Confinement at] Edinburgh.
         there was a Captain Maggett, that is obliged to lie in the Room every Night with him.
         when first he was introduced to him, he made him come to his Bedside where he lay
         in a hundred flannel Wastcoats and a furr'd Night-gown, took him in his Arms, &amp; gave
         him a long Embrace, that absolutely suffocated him. he will speak nothing but French;
         insists upon it, that Maggett is a Frenchman &amp; calls him, Mon cher Capitaine Magot
         (You know <span style="font-style:italic">Magot</span> is a Monkey) at his Head lie two Highland Women &amp; at his feet two Highland Men. by
         his Bedside is a Close-Stool to wch he rises two or three times in a Night, &amp; always
         says, Ah, mon cher Capitaine Magot! vous m'excuserez, mais la Nature demande que je
         chie! he is to be impeached by the House of Commons, because not being actually in
         Arms, it would otherwise be necessary, that the Jury of Inverness should find a Bill
         of Indictment against him, wch it is very sure they would not do. when the Duke return'd
         to Edinburgh they refused to admit Kingston's light Horse &amp; talked of their Privileges.
         but they came in Sword in Hand, &amp; replied, that when the Pretender was at their Gates,
         they had said nothing of their Privileges. the Duke rested some Hours there, but refused
         to see the Magistracy.
      </p>
      <p>I believe you may think it full Time, that I close my Budget of Stories: Mr. W: I
         have seen a good deal, &amp; shall do a good deal more, I suppose, for he is looking for
         a House somewhere about Windsor dureing the Summer. all is mighty free, &amp; even friendly.
         more than one could expect. you remember a Paper in the Museum on Message-Cards wch
         he told me was Fielding's, &amp; asked my Opinion about: it was his own, &amp; so was the
         Advertisement on Good-Breeding, that made us laugh so. Mr. A: I have had several Conversations
         with, &amp; do really believe he shews himself to me such as he really is: I don't tell
         you, I like him ever the better for it; but that may be my Fault, not his. the Pelhams
         lie very hard at his Stomach: he is not 40 yet, but he is 31, he says, &amp; thinks it
         his Duty to be married. one Thing of that Kind is just broke off; she had 12000[£
         in] her own Hands. this a profound Secret, but I not conceiving that he told it m[e
         as] such, happen'd to tell it to Stonhewer, who told it Lyne, who told it Asht: again,
         all i[n the] Space of three Hours. whereby I incurr'd a Scolding; so pray don't let
         me fall under [a] second, &amp; lose all my Hopes of riseing in the Church. he is still,
         as I said, resolute to m[arry] out of Hand; only two things he is terrified at, lest
         she should not breed, &amp; lest she should love him: I comforted him by saying, there
         was no Danger of either.
      </p>
      <p>the Muse, I doubt, is gone, &amp; has left me in far worse Company: if she returns, you
         will hear of her. You see I have left no Room for a Catalogue, wch is a Sort of Policy,
         for its hardly possible my Memory should supply one: I will try by next Time, wch
         will be soon, if I hear from you. if your Curiosity require any more Circumstances
         of these Tryals ... will see ... find some gr ... my best Compliments to the Little
         Man of the World.
