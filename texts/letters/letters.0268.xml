					       <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>If I did not immediately answer your kind enquiry, you will attribute it to the visit, wch I was obliged to do the honours of for two
					or three days, &amp; wch is now over. I find nothing new to add to my uneasiness here; on the contrary it is considerably abated, &amp;
					quiet, I hope, is gradually returning. I am extremely glad to hear your country residence promises so well, &amp; has been so serviceable to Mrs. Wharton already.</p>
				     <p>You desire to know how I like my visit. Lord N: is a sensible well-bred young Man, a little too fine
					even for me, who love a little finery: he never will be popular, &amp; it is well, if he be not very much hated. his party were Lord
						Villers, &amp; Mr Spencer, but I did not see a great deal of them.
					Ld John has been with me all this morning. the D: of Bedford is now
					here to settle his Son at Trinity, &amp; Mr Rigby is come to assist
					him with his advice.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu, I am interrupted, but will write again soon. believe me ever<lb/> Yours, </salute>
