      <p>The Pope is at last dead, and we are to set out for Rome on Monday next. The Conclave
         is still sitting there, and likely to continue so some time longer, as the two French
         Cardinals are but just arrived, and the German ones are still expected. It agrees

         at home go on much in their old course, you must not imagine them more various abroad.
         The diversions of a Florentine Lent are composed of a sermon in the morning, full
         of hell and the devil; a dinner at noon, full of fish and meager diet; and, in the
         evening, what is called a Conversazione, a sort of assembly at the principal people's
         houses, full of I cannot tell what: Besides this, there is twice a week a very grand
         concert. [...]
