         <p>P.S. </p>
         <p>I forgot to tell you the only thing I had worth telling you, that in a pocket book
            of Vertue, who you know was a rigid catholic &amp; who woud no more have invented a falshood
            on that side, than He coud invent, there is an Extract from a Copy taken by Martin
            Folkes of a Letter in the possession of the late Duke of Montagu; it was to the Duke's
            Ancestor Sr Ralph Winwood from the Duke of Buckingham, telling him how impatient the
            King was, &amp; how much he complained that Winwood had not yet disclosed to Gondomar
            the purport &amp; design of Sr Walter Raleigh's expedition to the West Indies!
