         <p>I should be extremely sorry to think that You or Mrs Wharton came a day the sooner to Town on my
					account this fine season. if you are already come, I shall come to you: if not, you will let me know some day this week (for I shall
					hardly stay here much longer) that I may write for a lodging. I rejoice to hear you are all well.</p>
         <p>If there be really any Enquiry into the Expedition (wch I believe will scarcely be, unless it be
					very hard press'd) many things will appear, as well with regard to the design as the execution, that do not yet seem to be generally
					known. the design, for wch the Soldiers were put into the boats, was to attack a Fort, call'd <hi rend="italic">Fourasse,</hi> at the
					mouth of the Charante (for Rochefort itself lies five miles up the River). it was necessary, they
					should be masters of this place not only to clear their way to the Town, but to have some place of security for their first imbarkation
					of about 1200 Men, who must remain for four hours exposed to the Enemy, before any reinforcement could join them (as the Admirals
					declared), &amp; (I have heard) this design was laid aside in great measure upon Capt: Howe's saying it would be, if practicable at
					all, a very bloody, &amp; difficult attempt. if therefore he asserts what you have been told, it is very strange. when I see you, I
					shall tell you more; &amp; even this, if you do not hear it publickly said, I should wish, you would not mention.</p>
         <p>I want to know what is said of our Capt: General's resignation &amp; the causes of it, for this
					seems a more extraordinary thing than the other.</p>
