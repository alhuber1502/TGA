         my brevity, when I tell you it is occasioned wholly by the hurry I am in to get to
         a place where I expect to meet with no other pleasure than the sight of you; for I
         am preparing for London in a few days at furthest. I do not wonder in the least at
         your frequent blaming my indolence, it ought rather to be called ingratitude, and
         I am obliged to your goodness for softening so harsh an appellation.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> When you have seen one of my days, you have seen a whole year of my life; they go
         round and round like the blind horse in the mill, only he has the satisfaction of
         fancying he makes a progress, and gets some ground; my eyes are open enough to see
         the same dull prospect, and to know that having made four-and-twenty steps more, I
         shall be just where I was; I may, better than most people, say my life is but a span,
         were I not afraid lest you should not believe that a person so short-lived could write
         even so long a letter as this; in short, I believe I must not send you the history
         of my own time, till I can send you that also of the reformation.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> However, as the most undeserving people in the world must sure have the vanity to
         wish somebody had a regard for them, so I need not wonder at my own, in being pleased
         that you care about me. You need not doubt, therefore, of having a first row in the
         front box of my little heart, and I believe you are not in danger of being crouded
         there; it is asking you to an old play, indeed, but you will be candid enough to excuse
         the whole piece for the sake of a few tolerable lines.</p>
