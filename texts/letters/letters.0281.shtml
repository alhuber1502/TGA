         <div class="dateline">Stoke, August 25, 1757. </div> 
         <div class="salute">Dear Sir –</div>
      </div>
      <p>I do not know why you should thank me for what you had a right and title to;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but attribute it to the excess of your politeness, and the more so because almost
         no one else has made me the same compliment. As your acquaintance in the University
         (you say) do me the honour to admire, it would be ungenerous in me not to give them
         notice that they are doing a very unfashionable thing, for all people of condition
         are agreed not to admire, nor even to understand: one very great man,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> writing to an acquaintance of his and mine, says that he had read them seven or eight
         times, and that now, when he next sees him, he shall not have above thirty questions
         to ask. Another, a peer,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> believes that the last stanza of the Second Ode relates to King Charles the First
         and Oliver Cromwell. Even my friends tell me they do not succeed, and write me moving
         topics of consolation on that head; in short, I have heard of nobody but a player<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and a doctor of divinity<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that profess their esteem for them. Oh yes! a lady of quality,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a friend of Mason's, who is a great reader. She knew there was a compliment to Dryden,
         but never suspected there was anything said about Shakspeare or Milton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> till it was explained to her; and wishes that there had been titles prefixed to tell
         what they were about.</p>
      <p>From this mention of Mason's name you may think, perhaps, we are great correspondents;
         no such thing; I have not heard from him these two months. I will be sure to scold
         in my own name as well as in yours. I rejoice to hear you are so ripe for the press,
         and so voluminous,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> –not for my own sake only, whom you flatter with the hopes of seeing your labours
         both public and private, – but for yours too, for to be employed is to be happy.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> This principle of mine, and I am convinced of its truth, has, as usual, no influence
         on my practice. I am alone and <span style="font-style:italic">ennuyé</span> to the last degree, yet do nothing; indeed I have one excuse; my health, which you
         so kindly enquire after, is not extraordinary, ever since I came hither. It is no
         great malady, but several little ones, that seem brewing no good to me.</p>
      <p>It will be a particular pleasure to me to hear whether Content dwells in Leicestershire,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and how she entertains herself there; only do not be too happy, nor forget entirely
         the quiet ugliness of Cambridge.</p>

         <p>If Mr. Brown falls in your way, be so good to shew him the beginning of this letter,
            and it will save me the labour of writing the same thing twice. His first letter,
            I believe, was in the mail that was robbed, for it was delayed many days; his second
            I have just received. </p>
