         <div class="salute">Dear Sir –</div>
      </div>
      <p>I do not know why you should thank me for what you had a right and title to; but attribute
         it to the excess of your politeness, and the more so because almost no one else has
         made me the same compliment. As your acquaintance in the University (you say) do me
         the honour to admire, it would be ungenerous in me not to give them notice that they
         are doing a very unfashionable thing, for all people of condition are agreed not to
         admire, nor even to understand: one very great man, writing to an acquaintance of
         his and mine, says that he had read them seven or eight times, and that now, when
         he next sees him, he shall not have above thirty questions to ask. Another, a peer,
         believes that the last stanza of the Second Ode relates to King Charles the First
         and Oliver Cromwell. Even my friends tell me they do not succeed, and write me moving
         topics of consolation on that head; in short, I have heard of nobody but a player
         and a doctor of divinity that profess their esteem for them. Oh yes! a lady of quality,
         a friend of Mason's, who is a great reader. She knew there was a compliment to Dryden,
         but never suspected there was anything said about Shakspeare or Milton, till it was
         explained to her; and wishes that there had been titles prefixed to tell what they
         were about.
      </p>
      <p>From this mention of Mason's name you may think, perhaps, we are great correspondents;
         no such thing; I have not heard from him these two months. I will be sure to scold
         in my own name as well as in yours. I rejoice to hear you are so ripe for the press,
         and so voluminous, –not for my own sake only, whom you flatter with the hopes of seeing
         your labours both public and private, – but for yours too, for to be employed is to
         be happy. This principle of mine, and I am convinced of its truth, has, as usual,
         no influence on my practice. I am alone and <span style="font-style:italic">ennuyé</span> to the last degree, yet do nothing; indeed I have one excuse; my health, which you
         so kindly enquire after, is not extraordinary, ever since I came hither. It is no
         great malady, but several little ones, that seem brewing no good to me.
      </p>
      <p>It will be a particular pleasure to me to hear whether Content dwells in Leicestershire,
         and how she entertains herself there; only do not be too happy, nor forget entirely
         the quiet ugliness of Cambridge.
      </p>

         <p>If Mr. Brown falls in your way, be so good to shew him the beginning of this letter,
            and it will save me the labour of writing the same thing twice. His first letter,
            I believe, was in the mail that was robbed, for it was delayed many days; his second
            I have just received.
