         <div class="salute">Dear Nicholls </div>
      </div>
      <p>Write by all means forthwith to Ld L:,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> give a little into his way of thinking, seem to fear you have gone a little too far
         in communicating so much of T:s letter, wch was not intended for his eye; but say
         you thought, you saw at bottom so much of respect &amp; affection for him, that you had
         the less scruple to lay open the weaknesses &amp; little suspicions of a Friend, that
         (you know beyond a doubt) very gratefully &amp; sincerely loves him. remind him <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <span style="font-style:italic">eloquently</span> (that is, from your heart, &amp; in such expressions as that will furnish)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> how many idle suspicions a sensible mind, naturally disposed to melancholy, &amp; depress'd
         by misfortune, is capable of entertaining, especially if it meets with but a shadow
         of neglect or contempt from the very (perhaps the only) person, in whose kindness
         it had taken refuge. remind him of his former goodness frankly &amp; generously shewn
         to T:, &amp; beg him not to destroy the natural effects of it by any appearance of pique
         or resentment, for that even the fancies &amp; chimÃ¦ras of a worthy heart deserve a little
         management &amp; even respect. assure him, as I believe, you safely may, that a few kind
         words, the slightest testimony of his esteem will brush away all T:s suspicions &amp;
         gloomy thoughts &amp; that there will need after this no constraint on his own behaviour
         (no, not so much as to ring a bell)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for, when one is secure of people's intentions, all the rest passes for nothing.</p>
      <p>To this purpose (but in my own way) would I write, &amp; mighty respectfully withall.
         it will come well from you, &amp; you can say without consequence what in T: himself it
         would be mean to say. Ld L: is rather more piqued than needs, methinks. the truth
         is, the causes of this quarrel on paper do appear puerile, as to the matter; but the
         manner is all, &amp; that we do not see. I rather stick by my Ld still, &amp; am set against
         Madam Minx:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> yet (as I told you before) the <span style="font-style:italic">house</span> lies hard at my stomach.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>There are many letters &amp; things, that I never saw, as that strange one in Wales,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; that to Lady Lisb:, now without these how can I judge? you have seen more of the
         matter, &amp; perhaps may be right: but as yet I do not believe it. what can that <span style="font-style:italic">firm &amp; spirited</span> letter be?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I fear it will make matters worse, &amp; yet it was sent away before he had seen T:s
         letter to you. if he had, it would have made it worse still.</p>
      <p>You ask, if you should copy Ld L:s, and send it to T:. I think, rather not. he has
         now had one from him himself. if you are obliged to do so, it should be only the sense
         of it, &amp; that abated &amp; mollified, especially all that tastes of contempt. </p>
      <p>Adieu! bless your stars, that you are snug in fat-goose living, without a Minx, &amp;
         without a Lord.</p>
