         <p>Receiving no Answer to my last letter, which I writ above a month ago, I must own I am a little
					uneasy. The slight shadow of you which I had in town, has only served to endear you to me the more.
					The moments I past with you made a strong impression upon me. I singled you out for a friend, and I would have you know me to be yours,
					if you deem me worthy. –Alas, Gray, you cannot imagine how miserably my time passes away. My health and nerves and spirits are,
					thank my stars, the very worst, I think, in Oxford. Four-and-twenty hours of pure unalloy'd health together, are as unknown to me as
					the 400,000 characters in the Chinese vocabulary. One of my complaints has of late been so over-civil as to visit me regularly once a
					month–jam certus conviva. This is a painful nervous headach, which perhaps you have sometimes
					heard me speak of before. Give me leave to say, I find no physic comparable to your letters. If, as it is said in Ecclesiasticus
					'Friendship be the physic of the mind', prescribe to me, dear Gray, as often and as much as you think
					proper, I shall be a most obedient patient.</p>
         <q>
            <p>Non ego <lb/> Fidis irascar medicis, offendar amicis.</p>
         </q>
         <p>I venture here to write you down a Greek epigram, which I lately turned into Latin, and hope you
					will excuse it.</p>
         <q>
            <p>Perspicui puerum ludentem in margine rivi <lb/> Immersit vitreæ limpidus error aquæ: <lb/> At gelido ut mater moribundum e flumine

						lumina composuit.

         </q>
         <p>Adieu! I am going to my tutor's lectures on one Puffendorff, a very jurisprudent author as you shall read on a summer's day.</p>
