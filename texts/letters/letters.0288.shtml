      </div>
      <p>I thank you for your history of Melpomene, wch is curious, &amp; ought to be remember'd.
         the judgement of the knowing ones ought always to be upon record, that they may not
         be suffer'd to retract &amp; mitigate their applause: if I were Dodsley I would sue them,
         &amp; they should buckle my shoe in Westminster-Hall. what is the reason, I hear nothing
         of your <span style="font-style:italic">waiting,</span>  &amp; your performances in publick? another thing. why has Mr H:s letter to you never
         been advertised, &amp; why do not I hear, what any body says about it?
      </p>
      <p>I go from hence for three days on Wednesday next, &amp; hope your inoculation will not
         be so over, that you should come to Windsor, before I return: if I had notice in due
         time, I would meet you at the Christopher in Eton, or if you chuse it (you know the
         worst, having been already here) shall rejoice to see you at Stoke. in town I shall
         hardly be, till next month. our expedition is extremely a l'Angloise: but I have given
         up all thoughts of England, &amp; care for no body but the King of Prussia. pray, do not
         suffer your Megrims to prevail over you. it is good for you, that you should come
         <span style="font-style:italic">to school</span> for a few months now &amp; then. I must say, no one has profited more in so few lessons.
         Common-Sense no where thrives better than in the neighbourhood of Nonsense.
