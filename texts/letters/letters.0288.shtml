         <div class="salute">Dear Mason</div>
      </div>
      <p>I thank you for your history of Melpomene,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch is curious, &amp; ought to be remember'd. the judgement of the knowing ones ought
         always to be upon record, that they may not be suffer'd to retract &amp; mitigate their
         applause: if I were Dodsley I would sue them, &amp; they should buckle my shoe in Westminster-Hall.
         what is the reason, I hear nothing of your <span style="font-style:italic">waiting,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; your performances in publick? another thing. why has Mr H:s letter<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to you never been advertised, &amp; why do not I hear, what any body says about it?</p>
      <p>I go from hence<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for three days on Wednesday next, &amp; hope your inoculation will not be so over, that
         you should come to Windsor, before I return: if I had notice in due time, I would
         meet you at the Christopher<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in Eton, or if you chuse it (you know the worst, having been already here) shall
         rejoice to see you at Stoke. in town I shall hardly be, till next month. our expedition<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is extremely a l'Angloise: but I have given up all thoughts of England, &amp; care for
         no body but the King of Prussia. pray, do not suffer your Megrims to prevail over
         you. it is good for you, that you should come <span style="font-style:italic">to school</span> for a few months now &amp; then. I must say, no one has profited more in so few lessons.
