					       <salute>My Dear Sr</salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>Three Days ago, as I was in the Coffee-house very deep in Advertisements, a Servant came in, &amp; waked me (as I thought) with the
					Name of Mr Chute. for half a minute I was not sure, but that it was You transported into England by some strange Chance the Lord knows
					how; till he brought me to a Coach that seem'd to have lost its way by looking for a Needle in a Bottle of Hay, in it was a
						Lady, who said she was not You, but only a near relation, &amp; was so good to give me a Letter, with
					which I return'd to my Den in order to prey upon it. I had wrote to you but a few days ago, &amp; am
					glad of so good an Excuse to do it again, wch I may the better do, as my last was all out, &amp; nothing to the Purpose, being design'd
					for a certain Mr Chute at Rome, &amp; not him at Florence.</p>
				     <p>I learn from it that I have been somewhat smarter, than I ought, but (to shew you with how little Malice) I protest I have not the
					least Idea what it was: my Memory would be better, did I read my own Letters so often, as I do yours. you must attribute it to a sort
					of kittenish Disposition, that scratches, where it means to caress; however I don't repent neither; if 'tis that, has made you write. I
					know, I need not ask pardon, for you have forgiven me: nay, I have a good Mind to complain myself. how could you say, that I design'd
					to hurt you, because I knew you could feel? I hate the thoughts of it, &amp; would not for the world wound any thing, that was
					sensible. 'tis true, I should be glad to scratch the Careless, or the Foolish, but no armour is so impenetrable, as Indifference &amp;
					Stupidity, and so I may keep my Claws to myself. for another Instance of the shortness of my Memory would you believe, I have so little
					knowledge of the Florentine History, as not to guess, who the Lady-Errant is you mention? sure it can't be the R:di &amp; her faithful Swain, or may be M. G:di &amp; the little Abbé. what you
					do there so long, I have no Conception. if you stay at other Places in proportion, I despair of ever seeing you again. 'tis true indeed
					Mr Mann is not every where. I am shock'd to think of his Sufferings, but he of all Men was born to
					suffer with a good Grace. he is a Stoick without knowing it, &amp; seems to think Pain a Pleasure: I am very sorry to complement him
					upon such an Occasion, &amp; wish with all my Heart he were not so pleased. I much fear his Books are gone already; but if not, to be
					sure he shall have Middleton, &amp; the Sofa. it seems most people
					here are not such admirers of it, as I was: but I won't give up an inch of it for all that. did I tell you about Mr Garrick, that the Town are horn-mad after; there are a dozen Dukes of a night at Goodmans-fields sometimes, &amp; yet I am stiff in the opposition. our fifth Opera was the
						Olympiade, in which they retain'd most of Pergolesi's Songs. &amp;
					yet 'tis gone already, as if it had been a poor thing of Galuppi's. two nights did I enjoy it all
					alone, snugg in a Nook in the Gallery, but found no one in those regions had ever heard of Pergolesi, nay, I heard several affirm it
					was a Composition of Pescetti's: now there is a 6th sprung up by the name of Cefalo &amp;
						Procri. my Lady of Queensbury is come out against my Lady of
						Marlborough; &amp; she has her Spirit too, &amp; her Originality, but more of the Woman, I think,
					than t'other; as to the Facts it don't signify two pence, who's in the right; the manner of fighting, &amp; character of the Combatants
					is all: 'tis hoped old Sarah will at her again. a Play of Mr Glover's, I am told, is prepareing for
					the stage call'd Boadicea: it is a fine Subject, but I have not an extreme Opinion of him. the
					Invalides at Chelsea intend to present Ranelagh-Gardens, as a Nusance, for breaking their first Sleep with the sound of Fiddles: it opens, I think, tonight. Messieurs
					the Commons are to ballot for 7 Persons tomorrow, commission'd to state the publick accounts, &amp; they are to be such, who have no
					places, nor are anyways dependent on the King. the Committee have petition'd for all Papers relateing to the Convention: a bill has pass'd the lower House for indemnifying all, who might subject themselves to Penalties by
					revealing any transaction with regard to the Conduct of My Ld Orford, &amp; tomorrow the Lords are
					summon'd about it. the Wit of the times consists in Satyrical Prints, I believe, there have been some
					Hundreds within this Month; if you have any hopeful young Designer of Caricaturas, that has a political Turn, he may pick up a pretty
					Subsistance here: let him pass thro' Holland to improve his Taste by the way. we are all very sorry for poor Queen Hungary; but we know of a second Battle (wch perhaps you may never hear off, but from me) as how Prince
						Lobbycock came up in the Nick of Time, &amp; cut 120,000 of'em all to pieces, &amp; how the King of
					Prussia narrowly scaped aboard a Ship, &amp; so got down the Dannub to Wolf-in-Bottle, where Mr
						Mallyboyce lay incamp'd, &amp; how the Hannoverians with Prince Hissy-Castle at their head, fell upon the French Mounseers, &amp; took him away with all his Treasure, among which is
					Pitt's Diamond, &amp; the Great Cistern. all this is firmly believed
					here, &amp; a vast deal more; upon the Strength of which we intend to declare War with France. </p>
				     <p>You are so obligeing as to put me in mind of our last Years little expeditions; alas! Sr, they are
					past, &amp; how many Years will it be, at the rate you go on, before we can possibly renew them in this Country? in all probability I
					shall be gone first on a long Expedition to that undiscover'd Country, from whose bourn no Traveller returns; however (if I can) I will
					think of you, as I sail down the <hi rend="italic">River of Eternity.</hi> I can't help thinking, that I should find no difference
					almost between this world &amp; t'other (for I converse with none but the dead here) only indeed I should receive, nor write no more
					Letters (for the Post is not very well regulated) if you see the King of Naples, pray talk with him on this Subject, for I see he is
					upon Settleing one between his country &amp; Constantinople, &amp; I take this to be but a little more difficult.</p>
				     <p>My Dab of Musick &amp; Prints you are very good to think of sending with your own; to which I will add a farther Trouble by desireing
					you to send me some of the Roots of a certain Flower, wch I have seen at Florence, it is a huge white Hyacynth tinged with Pink (Mr M:
					knows what I mean, by that same token that they grow sometimes in the fat Gerina's
					<hi rend="italic">Boosom</hi>) I mean, if they bear a reasonable Price, wch you will judge of for me: but don't give yourself any pains
						about it, for if they are not easily had, &amp; at an easy Rate, I am not at all eager for them: do
					you talk of <hi rend="italic">strumming</hi>? ohime! who have not seen the face of a <hi rend="italic">Haspical,</hi>
					 since I came home; no; I have hanged up my Harp on the Willows; however I look at my Musick now &amp;
					then, that I may not forget it, for when you return, I intend to sing a Song of Thanksgiving &amp; praise the Lord with a chearful
					Noise of many-stringed Instruments. Adieu! dear Sr,</p>
