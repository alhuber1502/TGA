            <dateline>Florence, July, 1740. </dateline>
         </opener>
         <p>At my return to this city, the day before yesterday, I had the pleasure of finding yours dated June the 9th. The period of our
					voyages, at least towards the south, is come, as you wish. We have been at Naples, spent nine or ten days there, and returned to Rome,
					where finding no likelihood of a Pope yet these three months, and quite wearied with the formal assemblies, and little society of that
					great city, Mr. Walpole determined to return hither to spend the summer, where he imagines he shall pass his time more agreeably than
					in the tedious expectation of what, when it happens, will only be a great show. For my own part, I give up the thoughts of all that
					with but little regret; but the city itself I do not part with so easily, which alone has amusements for whole years. However, I have
					passed through all that most people do, both ancient and modern; what that is you may see, better than I can tell you, in a thousand
					books. The Conclave we left in greater uncertainty than ever; the more than ordinary liberty they enjoy there, and the unusual coolness
					of the season, makes the confinement less disagreeable to them than common, and, consequently, maintains them in their irresolution.
					There have been very high words, one or two (it is said) have come even to blows; two more are dead within this last month,
						Cenci and Portia; the latter died distracted; and we left another
						(Altieri) at the extremity: Yet nobody dreams of an election till the latter end of September. All
					this gives great scandal to all good catholics, and every body talks very freely on the subject. The Pretender (whom you desire an
					account of) I have had frequent opportunities of seeing at church, at the corso, and other places; but more particularly, and that for
					a whole night, at a great ball given by Count Patrizii to the Prince and Princess Craon, (who were
					come to Rome at that time, that he might receive from the hands of the Emperor's minister there the order of the golden fleece) at
					which he and his two sons were present. They are good fine boys, especially the younger, who has the more spirit of the two, and both
					danced incessantly all night long. For him, he is a thin ill-made man, extremely tall and aukward, of a most unpromising countenance, a
					good deal resembling King James the Second, and has extremely the air and look of an idiot, particularly when he laughs or prays. The
					first he does not often, the latter continually. He lives private enough with his little court about him, consisting of Lord
						Dunbar, who manages every thing, and two or three of the Preston Scotch Lords, who would be very glad
					to make their peace at home.</p>
         <p>We happened to be at Naples on Corpus Christi Day, the greatest feast in the year, so had an opportunity of seeing their Sicilian
					Majesties to advantage. The King walked in the grand procession, and the Queen (being big with child)
					sat in a balcony. He followed the Host to the church of St. Clara, where high mass was celebrated to a glorious concert of music. They
					are as ugly a little pair as one can see: She a pale girl, marked with the small-pox; and he a brown boy with a thin face, a huge nose,
					and as ungain as possible.</p>
         <p>We are settled here with Mr. Mann in a charming apartment; the river Arno runs under our windows,
					which we can fish out of. The sky is so serene, and the air so temperate, that one continues in the open air all night long in a slight
					nightgown without any danger; and the marble bridge is the resort of every body, where they hear music, eat iced fruits, and sup by
					moon-light; though as yet (the season being extremely backward every where) these amusements are not begun. You see we are now coming
					northward again, though in no great haste; the Venetian and Milanese territories, and either Germany or the South of France, (according
					to the turn the war may take) are all that remain for us, that we have not yet seen; as to Loretto, and that part of Italy, we have
					given over all thoughts of it.</p>
