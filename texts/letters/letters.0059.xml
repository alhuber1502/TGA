         <p>I return you a thousand thanks for your elegant ode, and wish you every joy you wish yourself in it.
					But, take my word for it, you will never spend so agreeable a day here as you describe; alas! the sun with us rises only to shew us the
					way to Westminster-Hall. Nor must I forget thanking you for your little Alcaic fragment. The optic
					Naiads are infinitely obliged to you.</p>
         <p>I was last week at Richmond Lodge, with Mr Walpole, for two days, and dined with Cardinal
						Fleury; as far as my short sight can go, the character of his great art and penetration is very just,
					he is indeed</p>
         <q>
            <p>Nulli penetrabilis astro.

         <p>I go to-morrow to Epsom, where I shall be for about a month.</p>
