      <p>You had received an answer to your last letter sooner, had I been able to write: but
         I have been very ill for near a month, &amp; this is the first day, that I have breath'd
         the open air. I do not believe, I can give you any satisfaction as to the Proven√ßal
         poetry. Italy &amp; France abound in such Manuscripts, but we (I believe) have little
         of the kind among us left: at least I remember no such article in our Libraries. as
         to Eglisham's Pamphlet I have formerly read it here, &amp; think, I know, where it is:
         Baker's Extract is only a part of it relating to K: James's death, but there is more
         of it (as I remember) about the Marq:ss Hamilton worth transcribing. if the facts
         are true, it is curious; &amp; you shall have it soon.
      </p>
      <p>I received your books &amp; former letter unrifled, &amp; thank you much for them. the Anti-Twitcherites
         are numerous &amp; sanguine, &amp; make themselves sure of throwing him out, whatever becomes
         of their own Candidate: but as they are nearly equal, I doubt his Lp has some trick
         left to turn the scale.
      </p>
      <p>You are very perverse &amp; mysterious about your discoveries: but I hope to be satisfied
         next month. you never said a word about Mr B:y's <span style="font-style:italic">Patriotism</span>: I hope no body found out, how good some of it is. has he made his market by it?
