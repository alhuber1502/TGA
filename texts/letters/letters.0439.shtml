      <p>You had received an answer to your last letter sooner, had I been able to write: but
         I have been very ill for near a month,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; this is the first day, that I have breath'd the open air. I do not believe, I can
         give you any satisfaction as to the ProvenÃ§al poetry. Italy &amp; France abound in such
         Manuscripts, but we (I believe) have little of the kind among us left: at least I
         remember no such article in our Libraries. as to Eglisham's Pamphlet<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have formerly read it here, &amp; think, I know, where it is: Baker's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Extract is only a part of it relating to K: James's death, but there is more of it
         (as I remember) about the Marq:ss Hamilton worth transcribing. if the facts are true,
         it is curious; &amp; you shall have it soon.</p>
      <p>I received your books &amp; former letter unrifled,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; thank you much for them. the Anti-Twitcherites<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are numerous &amp; sanguine, &amp; make themselves sure of throwing him out, whatever becomes
         of their own Candidate: but as they are nearly equal, I doubt his Lp has some trick
         left to turn the scale.</p>
      <p>You are very perverse &amp; mysterious about your discoveries: but I hope to be satisfied
         next month. you never said a word about Mr B:y's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <span style="font-style:italic">Patriotism</span>: I hope no body found out, how good some of it is. has he made his market by it?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
