         <p>I wrote to you from London lately not knowing but you might care to go with me into Yorkshire tomorrow, but as I neither find you
						here, nor any letter from you, I conclude that is not to be. I would wish by all means to oblige
					&amp; serve T: in any way I am able, but it can not be <hi rend="italic">in his way</hi> at present.
					he &amp; you seem to think, that I have nothing else to do but to transcribe a page from some common-place-book on this head: if it
					were so, I should not hesitate a minute about it. but as I came from Town only on Thursday last, have
					only two days to pass here, &amp; must fetch all the materials from my own recollection, he must excuse me for the present. let him
					begin with Ld Bacon's Henry 7th, &amp; Ld Herbert's Henry 8th,
					&amp; by that time I return from Aston (wch will be in 3 weeks or less) perhaps I may be able to help him onwards a little. I keep the
					letter till we meet, least it be lost. I would reply nothing to the article of <hi rend="italic">separation</hi> ( [ ] for himself. [ ] point.
