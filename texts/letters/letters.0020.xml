         <p>Permit me again to write to you, though I have so long neglected my duty, and forgive my brevity, when I tell you it is occasioned
					wholly by the hurry I am in to get to a place where I expect to meet with no other pleasure than the sight of you; for I am preparing
					for London in a few days at furthest. I do not wonder in the least at your frequent blaming my indolence, it ought rather to be called
					ingratitude, and I am obliged to your goodness for softening so harsh an appellation. When you have
					seen one of my days, you have seen a whole year of my life; they go round and round like the blind horse in the mill, only he has the
					satisfaction of fancying he makes a progress, and gets some ground; my eyes are open enough to see the same dull prospect, and to know
					that having made four-and-twenty steps more, I shall be just where I was; I may, better than most people, say my life is but a span,
					were I not afraid lest you should not believe that a person so short-lived could write even so long a letter as this; in short, I
					believe I must not send you the history of my own time, till I can send you that also of the reformation. However, as the most undeserving people in the world must sure have the vanity to wish somebody had a regard for them, so I need
					not wonder at my own, in being pleased that you care about me. You need not doubt, therefore, of having a first row in the front box of
					my little heart, and I believe you are not in danger of being crouded there; it is asking you to an old play, indeed, but you will be
					candid enough to excuse the whole piece for the sake of a few tolerable lines.</p>
