				     <p>Are you not well, or what has happen'd to you? it is better than three weeks since I wrote to you (by Norwich &amp; Yarmouth) to say, I was return'd hither, &amp; hoped to see you; that Trin: Hall Lodge would be vacant, as Hallifax
					told me, to receive Mrs N: &amp; you, &amp; we expected you with impatience. I have had a sore throat, &amp; now am getting well of ye
					gout. Mason will be here on Tuesday. Palgrave keeps Lent at home &amp; wants to be ask'd to break it. Dr Law has bit at the
						Bishoprick, &amp; gives up near 800Â£ a-year to enjoy it: Dr Ross has
					his Prebend of Durham.</p>
