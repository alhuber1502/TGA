         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>I have received the draught you were so good to send me, &amp; the money is paid. you
         apprehend too much from my resolutions about writing: they are only made to be broken,
         &amp; after all it will be just as the maggot bites. you have a very mean opinion of the
         Epick,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if you think it consists only in laying out a Plan. in four &amp; twenty years at a moderate
         computation I may have finish'd twelve books, &amp; nine years after I hope to publish.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I shall then be 74 years old<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; I shall get 500Â£ for the copy to make me easy for the remainder of my days. somebody
         has directed a letter to the <span style="font-style:italic">Revd</span> Mr. G: at Strawberry-Hill, wch was sent me yesterday hither.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is anonymous, consists of above 9 pages, all about the Bard, &amp; if I would hear
         as much more about his Companion, I am to direct to the Posthouse at Andover.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I do not know but I may have that curiosity, for his observations (whoever it is)
         are not nonsense. he takes the liberty of a Person unknown, &amp; treats me with abundance
         of freedom. I guess it to be some <span style="font-style:italic">reading</span> Clergyman. Mr Brown &amp; I join in our best compliments to Mrs Wharton.</p>
