      <p>If Etoughe<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> had any such Paper trusted to his Hands, I don't at all doubt, but it has been shew'd
         to some one here. it is about three Weeks ago, that he was here with his Budget of
         Libels (for it is his constant Practise twice in a year to import a Cargo of Lyes,
         &amp; scandalous Truths mix'd) but his Confidents are caution'd against me, who have had
         more Squabbles than one either with him, or about him, so that <span style="font-style:italic">directly</span> it would be impossible for me to come at it, or even to hear of any of the Contents:
         but I have a round-about Way, or two in my head: if I succeed, you shall be sure to
         know immediately; but this will take up a Week, or a Fortnight, for I must not seem
         too eager about it. I am amazed at the Impudence of the Fiend, (as much a Fiend as
         I knew him.)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you say you took him to task;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I am impatient to know in what Manner. for I imagine you sent to him, &amp; that this
         has given him an Opportunity of writing those impudent Letters you mention to you.
         there are three Methods of taking him properly to task, the Cudgel, the Blanket, &amp;
         the Horse-pond. if you are present at the Operation, you may venture to break a Leg
         or an Arm <span style="font-style:italic">en attendant,</span> &amp; when I see you, I may possibly give you some Reasons, why you ought to have broke
         t'other Leg &amp; t'other Arm also: for it is too long to stay, till he is a Bishop.</p>
      <p>I do not wonder at their Rage venting itself on Mr Chute.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> they think him easier to come at, &amp; more open to Injury: I am glad he hears so little
         of the Matter. what my insipid Ld H:[...]on<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> could poke out of his Memory against him, I don't conceive. would to God anything
         I could do, might make all the World think of him as I do. but the way you propose,
         would signify very little.</p>
