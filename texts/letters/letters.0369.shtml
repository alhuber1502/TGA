      <p>My Enquiries, &amp; the Information I am able to give you in consequence of them, are
         as follows: if they amount to but little, thank yourself for applying to a sucking
         Antiquary. 
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Vertue's Mss<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (as I do not doubt, you have experienced) will often put you on a false scent. be
         assured, that Occleve's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> portrait of Chaucer is not, nor ever was in St John's Library: they have a Mss of
         the Troilus &amp; Cressida without illuminations, &amp; no other part of his works. in the
         University Library indeed there is a large volume with most of his works on vellum,
         &amp; by way of frontispiece is (pasted in) a pretty old print<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> taken (as it says) by Mr Speed from Occleve's original painting in the <span style="font-style:italic">book De Regimine Principum.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in the middle is Chaucer, a whole length; the same countenance, attitude, &amp; dress,
         that Vertue gives you in the two heads, wch he has engraved of him. the border is
         composed of escutcheons of arms, all the alliances of the Chaucer Family, &amp; at bottom
         the tomb of Thomas Chaucer &amp; Maud Burghersh at Ewelm.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the print &amp; all the arms are neatly colour'd. I only describe this, because I never
         took notice of such a print any where else, tho' perhaps you may know it; for I suppose
         it was done for some of Speed's Works.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> about the painting I have a great puzzle in my head between Vertue, Mr. D'urry,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Bishop Tanner.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Vertue (you know) has twice engraved Chaucer's head, once for D'urry's edition of
         his works, &amp; a second time in the Set of Poet's Heads. both are done from Occleve's
         painting: but he never tells us, where he found the painting, as he generally uses
         to do. D'urry says, there is a portrait of Chaucer (doubtless a whole length, for
         he describes his <span style="font-style:italic">port &amp; stature</span> from it), in possession of <span style="font-style:italic">George Greenwood, Esq.</span> of Chastleton in Gloucestershire. a little after he too mentions the picture by Occleve,
         but whether the same, or not, does not appear. Tanner in his Bibliotheca,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (Artic: Chaucer, see the notes) speaks of Occleve's painting too, but names another
         work of his (not the De Regim. Principum)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; adds, that it is in <span style="font-style:italic">the King's Library at Westminster</span>: if so, you will certainly find it in the Museum, &amp; Casley's Catalogue<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> will direct you to the place.
      </p>
      <p>Of the Profile of Dr Keys<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there is only a Copy in his College: but there is a Portrait of him (not in profile)
         a good picture, &amp; undoubtedly original, a half-figure upon board, dated Anno 1563,
         æt. suæ 53. There are 14 Latin verses inscribed on it, containing a character of him,
         as a Scholar &amp; excellent Physician, &amp; thus much more

      <p>At the corners is written Vivit Virtus, &amp; Virtus Vivit, <span style="font-style:italic">but no Painter's name.</span> in the same room hangs an old picture (very bad at first, &amp; now almost effaced by
         cleaning) of a Man in a slash'd doublet, dark curl'd hair &amp; beard, looking like a
         Foreigner, holding a pair of Compasses, &amp; by his side a Polyedron, made up of twelve
         pentagons. no name, or date. you will see presently, why I mention it.
      </p>
      <p>The Vice-Chancellor (Burroughs, Master of Keys)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> tells me he very well knew Vertue. that in a book belonging to the board of Works
         he had discover'd John of Padua<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to be the architect of Somerset-house, &amp; had found that he likewise built Long-leat
         for Sr John Thynne.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that it was from the similitude of style in those buildings, &amp; in the <span style="font-style:italic">four Gates</span> of Keys-College, he had imagined the latter to be also the work of John of Padua,
         &amp; this was <span style="font-style:italic">all the proof</span> he had of it. upon looking at these gates I plainly see, that they might very well
         be the work of one Man. from the College-books<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I find, that the East-side, in wch are the <span style="font-style:italic">Portæ Virtutis &amp; Sapientiæ</span>, was built in 1566, &amp; 1567. these are joined by two long walls to the <span style="font-style:italic">Porta Humilitatis,</span> opening to the Street; &amp; in the two walls are two little Dorick frontis-pieces, leading
         into gardens. all these are (I dare say) of one time, &amp; shew the Roman Architecture
         reviving amongst us with little Columns &amp; Pilasters, well enough proportion'd in themselves,
         &amp; neatly executed, but in no proportion to the building they are meant to adorn. in
         the year 1575 are these words, <span style="font-style:italic">Porta</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">quæ Honoris dicitur</span>) <span style="font-style:italic">&amp; ad Scholas Publicas aperit</span>) <span style="font-style:italic">a lapide quadrato duroqb </span> <span style="font-style:italic">extruebatur, ad eam scilicet formam &amp; effigiem, quam Doctor Caius</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">dum viveret</span>) <span style="font-style:italic">Architecto præscripserat, elaborata.</span> this is the Gate (more ornamented than the rest, but in the same style) wch you remember:
         it cost 128£. 9s. 5d. N:B: Dr Caius died July 29, 1573.
      </p>
      <p>In the same year, 1575, are these words: <span style="font-style:italic">Positum est Joh: Caio ex alabastro monumentum summi decoris &amp; artificii eodem in sacelli
            loco, quo corpus ejus antea sepeliebatur: cui præter insculpta illius insignia &amp; annotatum
            ætatis obitusqb </span> <span style="font-style:italic">diem &amp; annum</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">uti vivus executoribus ipse præceperat</span>) <span style="font-style:italic">duas tantummodo sententias has inscripsimus, Vivit post funera Virtus – Fui Caius.</span> this Monument (made to stand upon the ground, but now raised a great deal above the
         eye on a heavy ugly base projecting from the wall) is a Sarcophagus with rib'd work
         &amp; mouldings (somewhat antique) placed on a basement, supporting pretty large Corinthian
         columns of fine Alabaster, wch bear up an intablature, &amp; form a sort of canopy over
         it. the Capitals are gilt, &amp; the upper part both gilt &amp; painted with ugly scrolls
         &amp; compartments, <span style="font-style:italic">à l'Elisabet</span>; the rest is simple and well enough.

      <p>This column is now destroy'd, with all its sun-dials. but when Loggan<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> did his views of the colleges, the Pillar (tho' not the Dials) was still standing.
      </p>
      <p>From all this I draw, that Theodore Haveus of Cleves, the Architect, Sculptor, Painter,
         &amp; Diallist, did probably build the Porta Honoris (if not all the others)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; having work'd many years for Dr Caius &amp; the College, in gratitude left behind him

      <p>In the Gallery at Emanuel are several pictures<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> worth remarking, but not one name of a Painter to be found.

      <p>1. Archb:p Cranmer, head &amp; hands (on board) in his tippet of martens, &amp; seal-ring

         hat hanging on a chair, armour lying on the floor, &amp; a fine damask'd long pistol.
         letters on a table directed to hir Majestie's Ambassador. a carpet mightily finish'd.

      <p>In St John's Library is what I take for the original of Lady Margaret,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> kneeling at her oratory under a state. it is hung at a great height, &amp; spoil'd by
         damp &amp; neglect, while the Master keeps very choicely in his Lodge a miserable copy
         of it. in the same Library is a very good whole length of Bp Williams,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (while Lord Keeper) standing, &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">a carpet</span> in it finish'd with great care; perhaps therefore by the same hand with that of Sr
         Ant: Mildmay. in the lodge is a very good old Picture, that used to be call'd Bp Fisher,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but Dr Taylor<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has told them, it is <span style="font-style:italic">Sr</span> <span style="font-style:italic">Antony Brown.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> what his reasons are, I can not tell, as he is not here: 'tis surely of Henry 8ths
         time, &amp; a Layman; on a board split from top to bottom.
      </p>
      <p>I sympathise with your Gout: it would be strange if I did not, with so many internal
         monitors as I carry about me, that hourly bid me expect it myself this autumn. yet
         it frights me to hear of <span style="font-style:italic">both feet.</span> what did you do, &amp; in the night too, wch one foot only can make of equal duration
         with a night in Greenland?
      </p>
      <p>I thank you for your anecdote about Sr W:r Raleigh,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch is very extraordinary.
      </p>
      <p>What do you think of the Erse-Poems, now they are come out? I suppose your suspicions
         are augmented: yet (upon some farther enquiries I have made) Mr D:d Hume (the Historian)
         writes word,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that 'their authenticity is beyond all question; that Adam Smith, the celebrated
         Professor at Glasgow, has assured him (who doubted too) that he had heard the <span style="font-style:italic">Piper of the Argyleshire militia</span> repeat all these &amp; many more of equal beauty. that Major Mackay, the Laird &amp; Lady
         of Macleod, &amp; the Laird of Macfarline, the greatest Antiquarian in all their country,
         &amp; others, who live in the Highlands very remote from each other, remember them perfectly
         well, &amp; could not be acquainted with them, if they were not spread into every one's
         mouth there, &amp; become in a manner national works.' this is certainly the only proof,
         that works preserved merely by tradition, &amp; not in Manuscript, will admitt of.
      </p>
      <p>Adieu, I have done at last. oh no! my defence of Sr T: Wyat<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is much at your service, but as it was the first thing I transcribed (when I was
         little versed in old hands) there probably may be mistakes, wch I could correct by
         comparing it with the Mss, were I in Town. I have also four long letters of his to
         the King (while he was Embassador)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but, I doubt, you will scarce think them worth printing, as they contain no very
         remarkable facts, yet they help to shew the spirit, vigilance, &amp; activity of the Man.
      </p>
      <p>Look in Casley's Catalogue of the King's Library<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at 17. D. 4to. VI. 1. &amp; you will find the Mss of Occleve &amp; Painting of Chaucer.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
