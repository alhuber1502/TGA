            <dateline>Old Park, Thursday. Aug:</dateline>
            <salute>Dear Sr</salute>
         </opener>
         <p> It is true, I have been lately a very indifferent Correspondent, but Poverty knows no law, &amp; must be my excuse. since the
					fortnight I pass'd with Mason at York (who was then very bad with that troublesome defluxion in his eyes, and is since cured &amp; now
					stands on the brink of marriage), I have been always resident at Old Park, excursions excepted of a
					day or two at a time, and one lately of three weeks to Hartlepool. the rocks, the sea, &amp; the
					weather there, more than made up to me the want of bread &amp; the want of water, two capital defects, but of wch I learn'd from the
					inhabitants not to be sensible. they live on the refuse of their own fish-market, with a few potatoes, &amp; a reasonable quantity of
					Geneva, six days in the week, &amp; I have nowhere seen a taller, more robust, or healthy race. every house full of ruddy broad-faced
					children. nobody dies but of drowning or old age. nobody poor but from drunkenness, or mere laziness. I had long wish'd for a storm,
					and was treated before I came away with such a one as July could produce: but the waves did not rise above twelve foot high, &amp;
					there was no hurt done. on Monday (I believe) I go to Scotland with my Lord, and Tom, &amp; the
						Major. No Ladies are of the party: they remain at Hetton: yet I do
					not expect to see anything, for we go post, till I come to Glamis.
				</p>
         <p>I hear of P:s safe arrival in England: Pray congratulate him from me, &amp; beg, he would not give
					away all his pictures and gems, till I come. I hope to see him in October. is it true that young Tyrrell does not goe into orders? Dr. Hallifax (who was here with Dr. Lowth) tells me, that Ridlington is on his way to Nice. The last letter you sent
					me was from Mr. Ramsay, a Tenant of mine in Cornhill, who wants to see me <hi rend="italic">anent</hi> particular business. as I know
					not what it is I go with a little uneasiness on my mind farther North: but what can one do? I have told him my situation.</p>
         <p>The Doctor &amp; Mrs. Wharton wish for you often, tho' in vain. such is your perverseness! Adieu; I will write again from Scotland
					more at large.</p>
