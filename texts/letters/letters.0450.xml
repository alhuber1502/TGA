				     <p>I have received the C: of O:, &amp; return you my thanks for it. it engages our attention
						here, makes some of us cry a little, &amp; all in general afraid to go to bed o' nights. we take it
					for a translation, &amp; should believe it to be a true story, if it were not for St Nicholas.
				</p>
				     <p>When your pen was in your hand, you might have been a little more communicative: for, tho' disposed enough to believe the Opposition
					rather consumptive, I am entirely ignorant of all the symptoms. even what the Yorks have been doing
					for themselves, or attempting to do, is to me a secret. your canonical book I have been reading with
					great satisfaction. he speaketh as one having authority. if Englishmen have any feeling left, methinks they must feel now; &amp; if the
					Ministry have any feeling (whom no body will suspect of insensibility) they must cut off the Author's ears, for it is in all the forms
					a most wicked libel. is the old Man, &amp; the Lawyer put on, or is it real? or has some real Lawyer furnish'd a good part of the
					materials, &amp; another Person employ'd them? this I guess, for there is an uncouthness of diction in the beginning, wch is not
					supported throughout, though it now &amp; then occurs again, as if the Writer was weary of supporting the character he had assumed,
					when the subject had warmed him beyond dissimulation.</p>
				     <p>Rousseau's letters I am reading heavily, heavily! he justifies himself, till he convinces me, that
					he deserved to be burnt, at least that his book did. I am not got thro' him, &amp; you never will.
					Voltaire I detest, &amp; have not seen his book: I shall in good time. You surprise me, when you talk
					of going in February: pray, does all the Minority go too? I hope, you have a <hi rend="italic">reason. desperare de republic√¢</hi>
					 is a deadly sin in politicks. </p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu! I will not take my leave of you, for (you perceive) this letter means to beg another, when you can spare a little. </salute>
					       <dateline>Sunday Dec: 30. 1764.</dateline>
