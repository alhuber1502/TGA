         <p>I rejoice to hear that you are restored to a better state of health, to your books, and to your muse once again. That forced dissipation and exercise we are obliged to fly to as a remedy, when this frail machine goes
					wrong, is often almost as bad as the distemper we would cure; yet I too have been constrained of late to pursue a like regimen, on
					account of certain pains in the head (a sensation unknown to me before), and of great dejection of spirits. This, Sir, is the only
					excuse I have to make you for my long silence, and not (as perhaps you may have figured to yourself) any secret reluctance I had to
					tell you my mind concerning the specimen you so kindly sent me of your new Poem. On the contrary, if
					I had seen anything of importance to disapprove, I should have hastened to inform you, and never doubted of being forgiven. The truth
					is, I greatly like all I have seen, and wish to see more. The design is simple, and pregnant with poetical ideas of various kinds, yet
					seems somehow imperfect at the end. Why may not young Edwin, when necessity has driven him to take up the harp, and assume the
					profession of a Minstrel, do some great and singular service to his country? (what service I must leave to your invention) such as no
					General, no Statesman, no Moralist could do without the aid of music, inspiration, and poetry. This will not appear an improbability in
					those early times, and in a character then held sacred, and respected by all nations. Besides, it will be a full answer to all the
					Hermit has said, when he dissuaded him from cultivating these pleasing arts; it will shew their use, and make the best panegyrick of
					our favourite and celestial science. And lastly, (what weighs most with me) it will throw more of action, pathos, and interest into
					your design, which already abounds in reflection and sentiment. As to description, I have always thought that it made the most graceful
					ornament of poetry, but never ought to make the subject. Your ideas are new, and borrowed from a mountainous country, the only one that
					can furnish truly picturesque scenery. Some trifles in the language or versification you will permit me to remark. </p>
         <p>[ ]
				</p>
         <p>I will not enter at present into the merits of your <hi rend="italic">Essay on Truth,</hi> because I have not yet given it all the
					attention it deserves, though I have read it through with pleasure; besides I am partial; for I have always thought David Hume a pernicious writer, and believe he has done as much mischief here as he has in his own country. A turbid
					and shallow stream often appears to our apprehensions very deep. A professed sceptic can be guided by nothing but his present passions
					(if he has any) and interests; and to be masters of his philosophy we need not his books or advice, for every child is capable of the
					same thing, without any study at all. Is not that <hi rend="italic">naivet√©</hi> and good humour, which his admirers celebrate in him,
					owing to this, that he has continued all his days an infant, but one that unhappily has been taught to read and write? That childish
					nation, the French, have given him vogue and fashion, and we, as usual, have learned from them to admire him at second hand.</p>
