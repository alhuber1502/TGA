         <p>Mr. Chute's proceedings are, as follows. soon after I wrote to you, being very easy, he got up &amp; sate in a chair for two days,
					where having caught cold, he proceeded to go to bed again. however as he has felt no great matter of pain, today he is to be seen once
					more sitting by the fire-side. he won't hear of London, but talks of Bath, so I am easy about it, as that seems full as well. yet I
					wish, he would hasten his journey. I think of returning in four or five days to Stoke, as he is now no longer alone in the house. we
					are much obliged to you for your Packets &amp; Newses, particularly for your old News. I, who deal in sequels &amp; second Parts, am
					anxious to know, what became of my Lady Sundon. whether she sunk into the ground, or flew thro' the
					window after this thunderclap.</p>
