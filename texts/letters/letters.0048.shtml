      <p>I should say Mr Inspector general of the Exports &amp; Imports, but that appellation would
         make but an odd figure in conjunction with the two familiar monosyllables above written,
         for, Non bene conveniunt, nec in un√¢ sede morantur Majestas &amp; amor, which is being
         interpreted, Love does not live at the Custom-house: however by what style, title,
         or denomination soever you please to be dignified or distinguish'd hereafter, you'll
         never get rid of these two words, nor of your christian-name: it will stick like a
         Burr, &amp; you can no more get quitt of it, than St Anthony could of his Pigg: we had
         no Queen to bury here, so I have no procession to tell you of; but we are collecting
         our flowers, as fast as may be, to strew upon her tomb: Mr Pemberton of Cath: Hall
         &amp; one Ambrose of Trin: Hall, a blind Man, they say will bear away the bell; both English;
         Mr Whitehead does not shine vastly this time: the bellman has paid his duty in the
         following epigram.

         <p>Oh cruel death! how could'st be so unkind <br /> To snatch the Queen, &amp; leave the King behind?

      <p>almost as Laconick, as Mr Conways letter; who has wrought to his sister in the same
         style, as one would write to the devil whose ancient title has been, Old Boy:,
