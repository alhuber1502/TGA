      <p>I should say Mr Inspector general of the Exports &amp; Imports,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but that appellation would make but an odd figure in conjunction with the two familiar
         monosyllables above written, for, Non bene conveniunt, nec in unÃ¢ sede morantur Majestas
         &amp; amor,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which is being interpreted, Love does not live at the Custom-house: however by what
         style, title, or denomination soever you please to be dignified or distinguish'd hereafter,
         you'll never get rid of these two words, nor of your christian-name: it will stick
         like a Burr, &amp; you can no more get quitt of it, than St Anthony could of his Pigg:
         we had no Queen to bury here, so I have no procession to tell you of;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but we are collecting our flowers, as fast as may be, to strew upon her tomb:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mr Pemberton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Cath: Hall &amp; one Ambrose<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Trin: Hall, a blind Man, they say will bear away the bell; both English; Mr Whitehead<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> does not shine vastly this time: the bellman has paid his duty in the following epigram.</p>

         <p>Oh cruel death! how could'st be so unkind <br /> To snatch the Queen, &amp; leave the King behind?</p>
