      <p>I am this night arrived here, and have just set down to rest me after eight days tiresome
         journey: For the three first we had the same road we before past through to go to
         Geneva; the fourth we turned out of it, and for that day and the next travelled rather
         among than upon the Alps; the way commonly running through a deep valley by the side
         of the river Arc, which works itself a passage, with great difficulty and a mighty
         noise, among vast quantities of rocks, that have rolled down from the mountain tops.
         The winter was so far advanced, as in great measure to spoil the beauty of the prospect,
         however, there was still somewhat fine remaining amidst the savageness and horror
         of the place: The sixth we began to go up several of these mountains; and as we were
         passing one, met with an odd accident enough: Mr. Walpole had a little fat black spaniel,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that he was very fond of, which he sometimes used to set down, and let it run by
         the chaise side. We were at that time in a very rough road, not two yards broad at
         most; on one side was a great wood of pines, and on the other a vast precipice; it
         was noon-day, and the sun shone bright, when all of a sudden, from the wood-side,
         (which was as steep upwards, as the other part was downwards) out rushed a great wolf,
         came close to the head of the horses, seized the dog by the throat, and rushed up
         the hill again with him in his mouth. This was done in less than a quarter of a minute;
         we all saw it, and yet the servants had not time to draw their pistols, or do any
         thing to save the dog. If he had not been there, and the creature had thought fit
         to lay hold of one of the horses; chaise, and we, and all must inevitably have tumbled
         above fifty fathoms perpendicular down the precipice. The seventh we came to Lanebourg,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the last town in Savoy; it lies at the foot of the famous mount Cenis, which is so
         situated as to allow no room for any way but over the very top of it. Here the chaise
         was forced to be pulled to pieces, and the baggage and that to be carried by mules:
         We ourselves were wrapped up in our furs, and seated upon a sort of matted chair without
         legs, which is carried upon poles in the manner of a bier, and so begun to ascend
         by the help of eight men. It was six miles to the top, where a plain opens itself
         about as many more in breadth, covered perpetually with very deep snow, and in the
         midst of that a great lake of unfathomable depth, from whence a river takes its rise,
         and tumbles over monstrous rocks quite down the other side of the mountain. The descent
         is six miles more, but infinitely more steep than the going up; and here the men perfectly
         fly down with you, stepping from stone to stone with incredible swiftness in places
         where none but they could go three paces without falling. The immensity of the precipices,
         the roaring of the river and torrents that run into it, the huge craggs covered with
         ice and snow, and the clouds below you and about you, are objects it is impossible
         to conceive without seeing them; and though we had heard many strange descriptions
         of the scene, none of them at all came up to it. We were but five hours in performing
         the whole, from which you may judge of the rapidity of the men's motion. We are now
         got into Piedmont, and stopped a little while at La Ferriere, a small village about
         three quarters of the way down, but still among the clouds, where we began to hear
         a new language spoken round about us; at last we got quite down, went through the
         PÃ¡s de Suse, a narrow road among the Alps, defended by two fortresses, and lay at
         Bossolens: Next evening through a fine avenue of nine miles in length, as straight
         as a line, we arrived at this city,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which, as you know, is the capital of the Principality, and the residence of the
         King of Sardinia. [...]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> We shall stay here, I believe, a fortnight, and proceed for Genoa, which is three
         or four days journey to go post.</p>
