      <p>He must have a very good stomach that can digest the <span style="font-style:italic">Crambe recocta</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Voltaire. Atheism is a vile dish, tho' all the cooks of France combine to make
         new sauces to it. As to the Soul, perhaps they may have none on the Continent; but
         I do think we have such things in England. Shakespear, for example, I believe had
         several to his own share. As to the Jews (tho' they do not eat pork) I like them because
         they are better Christians than Voltaire.</p>
