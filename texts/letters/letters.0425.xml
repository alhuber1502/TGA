            <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>As I have no more received my little <hi rend="italic">thingumterries,</hi>
					 than you have yours, tho they were sent by the Beverly, Captain
					Allen, I have return'd no answer yet; but I must soon, &amp; that in plain English, and so should you too. in the mean time I borrow'd
					&amp; read them. that on the Opera is a good clever dissertation, dedicated to <hi rend="italic">Guglielmo Pitt.</hi>
					 the other (<hi rend="italic">Il Congresso di Citera</hi>) in
					poetical prose describes the negotiation of three Embassadresses sent by England, France, &amp; Italy to the Court of Cupid to lay
					before him the state of his empire in the three nations, &amp; is not contemptible neither in its kind: so pray be civil to the Count,
					&amp; Signor Howe.</p>
         <p>I think it may be time enough to send poor Smart the money you have been so kind to collect for him, when he has drop'd his law-suit,
					wch I don't doubt must go against him, if he pursues it. Gordon (who lives here) knows, &amp;
					interests himself about him: from him I shall probably know, if he can be persuaded to drop his design. there is a Mr Anguish in Town (with whom, I fancy, you were once acquainted) he probably can best inform you of his condition
					&amp; motions, for I hear, he continues to be very friendly to him. </p>
         <p>When you speak of Mr Bed:ld you have always a dash of gall, that shews your unforgiving temper, only because it was to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> great chair, that he made the first visit. for this cause you refused the
					snuff-box (wch to punish you I shall accept myself) &amp; for this cause you obstinately adhere to the Church of England.
				</p>
         <p>I like your Sonnet better than most dedications. it is simple &amp; natural: the best line in it is <q> So to deceive my solitary
						days &amp;c: </q> there are an expression or two, that <hi rend="italic">break the repose</hi> of it by looking common &amp;
					over-worn. <hi rend="italic">sequester'd shade, woodbine sprays, selected lays</hi>: I dare not
					mention <hi rend="italic">letter'd ease. Life's vain vision</hi> does not pronounce well. bating these, it looks in earnest, &amp; as
					if you could live at Aston, which is not true; but that is not my affair.</p>
         <p>I have got a Mass of Pergolesi, wch is all divinity: but it was lent me, or you should have it. by
					all means send for six Lessons (for the Piano-Forte Harpsichord) of Carlo Bach, not the
						Opera-Bach, but his Brother. to my fancy they are charming, &amp; in the best Italian style: Mr
						Nevile &amp; the old Musicianers here do not like them, but to me they speak not only musick, but
					passion. I can not play them, tho' they are not hard: yet I make a smattering, that serves Ã¢&#x80;&#x93; <hi rend="italic">to deceive my
						solitary days.</hi> &amp; I figure to myself, that I hear you touch them triumphantly. Adieu! I should like to hear from you.</p>
         <p>The Petit Bon sends his love to you. all the rest (but Dr May
					&amp; the Master) are dead, or married.</p>
