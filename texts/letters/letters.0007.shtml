      <p>When the Dew of the morning is upon me, thy Image is before mine eyes; nor, when the
         night overshadoweth me, dost thou depart from me. shall I ne'er behold thine eyes,
         until our eternal meeting in ye immortal Chioses<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of Paradise; and sure at that hour, thy Soul will have little need of Ablution in

         I wander in Solitariness, as a traveller in the sandy desarts of Barca, &amp; pine in

         Slumbers, I have attempted to seize on thee, I sought for thee &amp; behold! thou wert
         not there! thou wert departed, as the smoke, or as the Shadows, when the Sun entreth
         his bed-chamber: were I to behold thy countenance, tho' afar off; my heart should
         bound as the Antelope; yea! my soul should be as light, as the Roe-buck on the hills
