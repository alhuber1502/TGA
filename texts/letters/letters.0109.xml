         <p>We still continue constant at Florence, at present one of the dullest cities in Italy. Though it is the middle of the Carnival there
					are no public diversions; nor is masquerading permitted as yet. The Emperor's obsequies are to be
					celebrated publickly the 16th of this month; and after that, it is imagined every thing will go on in its usual course. In the mean
					time, to employ the minds of the populace, the Government has thought fit to bring into the city in a solemn manner, and at a great
					expence, a famous statue of the Virgin called the Madonna dell'Impruneta, from the place of her
					residence, which is upon a mountain seven miles off. It never has been practised but at times of public calamity; and was done at
					present to avert the ill effects of a late great inundation, which it was feared might cause some
					epidemical distemper. It was introduced a fortnight ago in procession, attended by the Council of Regency, the Senate, the Nobility,
					and all the Religious Orders, on foot and bare-headed, and so carried to the great church, where it was frequented by an infinite
					concourse of people from all the country round. Among the rest I paid my devotions almost every day, and saw numbers of people
					possessed with the devil, who were brought to be exorcised. It was indeed in the evening, and the church-doors were always shut before
					the ceremonies were finished, so that I could not be eye-witness of the event; but that they were all cured is certain, for one never
					heard any more of them the next morning. I am to-night just returned from seeing our Lady make her exit with the same solemnities she
					entered. The show had a finer effect than before; for it was dark; and every body (even those of the mob that could afford it) bore a
					white-wax flambeau. I believe there were at least five thousand of them, and the march was near three hours in passing before the
					window. The subject of all this devotion is supposed to be a large Tile with a rude figure in bas-relief upon it. I say supposed,
					because since the time it was found (for it was found in the earth in ploughing) only two people have seen it; the one was, by good
					luck, a saint; the other was struck blind for his presumption. Ever since she has been covered with seven veils; nevertheless, those
					who approach her tabernacle cast their eyes down, for fear they should spy her through all her veils. Such is the history, as I had it
					from the Lady of the house where I stood to see her pass; with many other circumstances; all which she firmly believes, and ten
					thousand beside. </p>
         <p>We shall go to Venice in about six weeks, or sooner. A number of German troops are upon their march into this State, in case the King
					of Naples thinks proper to attack it. It is certain he has asked the Pope's leave for his troops to pass through his country. The
					Tuscans in general are much discontented, and foolish enough to wish for a Spanish government, or any rather than this. [...] </p>
