      <p>I hope in God, before now you have given Mr Barrett his answer. I always supposed
         you would refuse, &amp; told him so: yet as he does not write to me, I much doubt whether
         you have acquainted him of it. why, did not I desire you to do so out of hand? &amp; did
         not I make my civilities to Mrs. Nicholls? 'tis sure I intended both one &amp; the other:
         but you never allow for business: why, I am selling an estate, &amp; over head &amp; ears
         in writings.
      </p>
      <p>Next week I come to Cambridge. pray let me find a letter from you there, telling me
         the way to Lovingland: for thither I come, as soon as I have been sworn in, &amp; subscribed,
         &amp; been at Church. poor Mr Spence was found drown'd in his own garden at Byfield: probably
         (being paralytic) he fell into the water, &amp; had no one near to help him: so <span style="font-style:italic">History</span> has lost two of her chief supports almost at once. let us pray for their Successors!
         his Danish Majesty has had a Diarrh√¶a, so could not partake of Dr Marriot's collation:
         if he goes thither at all, I would contrive not to be present at the time.
