				     <p>You use me very cruelly: You have sent me but one letter since I have been at Oxford, and that too agreeable not to make me sensible
					how great my loss is in not having more. Next to seeing you is the pleasure of seeing your handwriting; next to hearing you is the
					pleasure of hearing from you. Really and sincerely I wonder at you, that you thought it not worth while to answer my last letter. I
					hope this will have better success in behalf of your quondam school-fellow; in behalf of one who has walked hand in hand with you, like
					the two children in the wood,</p>
				     <q>
            <p> Through many a flowery path and shelly grot, <lb/> Where learning lull'd us in her private maze. </p>
         </q>
				     <p>The very thought, you see, tips my pen with poetry, and brings Eton to my view. Consider me very seriously here in a strange country,
					inhabited by things that call themselves Doctors and Masters of Arts; a country flowing with syllogisms and ale, where Horace and
					Virgil are equally unknown; consider me, I say, in this melancholy light, and then think if something be not due to </p>

					       <salute>Yours.</salute>
					       <dateline>Christ Church. Nov. 14. 1735.</dateline>
				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p>P.S. I desire you will send me soon, and truly and positively, a history of your own time.
