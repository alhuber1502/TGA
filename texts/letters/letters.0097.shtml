            <div class="dateline">Rome, May 14, 1740. N.S. </div>
         </div>
         <p>Boileau's Discord dwelt in a College of Monks.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> At present the Lady is in the Conclave. Cardinal Corsini<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been interrogated about certain Millions of Crowns that are absent from the Apostolic
            Chamber; He refuses giving Account, but to a Pope: However he has set several Arithmeticians
            to work, to compose Summs, &amp; flourish out Expenses, which probably never existed.
            Cardinal Cibo<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> pretends to have a Banker at Genoa, who will prove that he has received three Millions
            on the Part of the Eminent Corsini. This Cibo is a madman, but set on by others. He
            had formerly some great office in the government, from whence they are generally rais'd
            to the Cardinalate. After a time, not being promoted as he expected, he resign'd his
            Post, and retir'd to a Mountain where He built a most magnificient Hermitage. There
            He inhabited for two years, grew tir'd, came back and received the Hat.
         </p>
         <p>Other feuds have been between Card. Portia<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and the Faction of Benedict the Thirteenth,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> by whom He was made Cardinal. About a month ago, he was within three Votes of being
            Pope. he did not apply to any Party, but went gleaning privately from all &amp; of a sudden
            burst out with a Number; but too soon, &amp; that threw Him quite out. Having been since
            left out of their Meetings, he ask'd one of the Benedictine Cardinals the reason;
            who replied, that he never had been their Friend, &amp; never should be of their assemblies;
            &amp; did not even hesitate to call him Apostate. This flung Portia into such a Rage that
            He spit blood, &amp; instantly left the Conclave with all his Baggage. But the great Cause
            of their Antipathy to Him, was His having been one of the Four, that voted for putting
            Coscia<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to Death; Who now regains his Interest, &amp; may prove somewhat disagreable to his Enemies;
            Whose Honesty is not abundantly heavier than His Own. He met Corsini t'other Day,
            &amp; told Him, He heard His Eminence had a mind to his Cell: Corsini answer'd He was
            very well contented with that He had. Oh, says Coscia, I don't mean here in the Conclave;
            but in the Castle St. Angelo.
         </p>
         <p>With all these Animosities, One is near having a Pope. Card. Gotti,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> an Old, inoffensive Dominican, without any Relations, wanted yesterday but two voices;
            &amp; is still most likely to succeed. Card. Altieri has been sent for from Albano, whither
            he was retir'd upon account of his Brother's Death,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; his own Illness; &amp; where He was to stay till the Election drew nigh. There! there's
            a sufficient Competency of Conclave News, I think.
         </p>
         <p>We have miserable Weather for the Season; Coud You think I was writing to You by my
            fireside at Rome in the middle of May? the Common People say tis occasion'd by the
            Pope's Soul, which cannot find Rest. 
         </p>
         <p>How goes your War? We are persuaded here of an additional one with France, Lord! it
            will be dreadfull to return thro Germany. I don't know who cooks up the News, here,
            but we have some Strange Peice every day. One that is much in Vogue, &amp; would not be
            disagreable for US, is, that the Czarina<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has clap'd the Marquis de la Chetardie<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in Prison. One must hope till some Months hence tis all contradicted.
         </p>
         <p>I am balancing in great Uncertainty, whether to go to Naples or stay here; You know
            'twoud be provoking to have a Pope chosen just as One's Back was turn'd: and if I
            wait, I fear the Heats may arrive. I don't know what to do. 
         </p>
         <p>We are going to-night to a Great Assembly, at One of the Villas just out of the City,
            whither all the English are invited;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> amongst the rest, Mr. Stuard and his two Sons.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> There is one lives with Him call'd Lord Dunbar,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Murray's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> brother, who wou'd be his Minister, if he had any Occasion for One. I meet him frequently
            in public places, &amp; like Him. He is very sensible, very agreable &amp; well bred.
         </p>
         <p>Good night, Child: by the way I have had no letters from England, these two last Posts.

         <p>I am by trade a Finisher of Letters. don't you wonder at the Conclave? instead of
            being immured, every one in his proper hutch, as one used to imagine: they have the
            liberty of skuttleing out of one hole into another, &amp; might breed, if they were young
            enough. I do assure you every thing one has heard say of Italy is a Lye, &amp; am firmly
            of opinion, that no mortal was ever here before us. I am writeing to prove there never
            was any such people as the Romans, that this was antiently a Colony of the Jews, and
            that the Coliseum was built on the model of Solomon's Temple. our people have told
            so many Stories of them, that they don't believe any thing we say about ourselves;
            Porto Bello is still said to be impregnable<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; it is reported the Dutch have declared War against us. the English Court here brighten
            up on the News of our Conquests, &amp; conclude all the contrary has happen'd. you do
            not know perhaps, that we have our little good fortune in the Mediterranean, where
            Adml. Haddock has overturn'd certain little Boats carrying troops to Majorca, drown'd
            a few hundreds of them, &amp; taken a little Grandee of Spain, that commanded the expedition:
            at least so they say at Naples:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I'm very sorry, but methinks they seem in a bad condition. is West dead to the World
            in general, or only so to me? for you I have not the impudence to accuse; but you
            are to take this, as a sort of reproof, &amp; I hope you will demean yourself accordingly.
            you are hereby authorized to make my very particular compliments to My Ld. Plymouth,
            &amp; return him my thanks de l'honneur de son souvenir. so I finish my Postscript with
