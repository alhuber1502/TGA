					       <p>I received last night your letter big with another a week older than itself. you might as well have wrote to me from the deserts of
						Arabia, &amp; desired me to step over &amp; drink a dish of tea with you. this morning I sent to
							Aukland for a chaise: the Man's answer is, that he had a chaise with four horses return'd yesterday
						from Hartlepool, that the road was next to impassable, &amp; so dangerous, that he does not think of sending out any other that way,
						unless the season should change to a long drought. I would have gone by Durham, but am assured, that road is rather worse. what can I
						do? you speak so jauntily, &amp; enter so little into any detail of your own journey, that I conclude you came on horseback from
						Stockton (wch road however is little better for carriages) if so, we hope you will ride over to Old-Park with Mr Alderston: there is room for you both, &amp; hearty welcome. the Doctor even talks of coming (for he can ride) to
						invite you on Monday. I wonder how you are accommodated, where you are; &amp; what you are doing with Gen: Carey: I would give my ears
						to get thither, but all depends on the sun.</p>

					       <p>It is twenty miles to Old-Park, &amp; the way is by <hi rend="italic">Hart,</hi> over Sherraton-moor &amp; through Trimden there is
						no village else that has a name. pray, write a line by the bearer. we have a confirmation of the above accou[n]t of the state of the
						roads from other evidences–nevertheless I shall certainly come on horseback on Monday to inquire after your proceedings and
						designs and to preveil upon You and Mr Aldeston to return with me to Old Park–a rainy morning perhaps may stop me a few hours
						but when it clears up I shall set forward. Adieu–accept all our Complimts. </p>
