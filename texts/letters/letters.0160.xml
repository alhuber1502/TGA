				     <p>It is a misfortune to me to be at a distance from both of you at present. A letter can give one so
					little idea of such matters! [ ] I always believed well of his heart and temper, and would gladly do so still. If they are as they
					should be, I should have expected every thing from such an explanation; for it is a tenet with me (a simple one, you'll perhaps say),
					that if ever two people, who love one another, come to breaking, it is for want of a timely eclaircissement, a full and precise one,
					without witnesses or mediators, and without reserving any one disagreeable circumstance for the mind to brood upon in silence.</p>
				     <p>I am not totally of your mind as to Mr. Lyttleton's Elegy, though I love kids and fawns as little as you do. If it were all like the fourth stanza, I should be
					excessively pleased. Nature and sorrow, and tenderness, are the true genius of such things; and something of these I find in several
					parts of it (not in the orange-tree): poetical ornaments are foreign to the purpose; for they only
					show a man is not sorry;â€“and devotion worse; for it teaches him, that he ought not to be sorry, which is all the pleasure of the
					thing. I beg leave to turn your weathercock the contrary way. Your Epistle I have not seen a great
					while, and doctor M. is not in the way to give me a sight of it: but I remember enough to be sure all
					the world will be pleased with it, even with all its <hi rend="italic">faults upon its head,</hi> if you don't care to mend them. I
					would try to do it myself (however hazardous), rather than it should remain unpublished. As to my Eton Ode, Mr. Dodsley is <hi rend="italic">padrone.</hi> The second you had, I
					suppose you do not think worth giving him: otherwise, to me it seems not worse than the former. He might have Selima too, unless she be of too little importance for his patriot-collection; or perhaps the <hi rend="italic">connections</hi> you had with her may interfere. <hi rend="italic">Che so io</hi>? Adieu!</p>
