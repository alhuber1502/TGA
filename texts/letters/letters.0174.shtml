      <p> but Aristotle may say whatever he pleases. I do not find myself at all the worse
         for it. I could indeed wish to refresh my <span style="font-style:italic">Î&#x95;Î½á½³Ï&#x81;Î³ÎµÎ¹Î±</span> a little at Durham by a Sight of you, but when is there a Probability of my being
         so happy? it concerned me greatly when I heard the other Day, that your Asthma continued
         at Times to afflict you, &amp; that you were often obliged to go into the Country to breath.
         you cannot oblige me more than by giving me an Account of the State both of your Body
         &amp; Mind; I hope the latter is able to keep you chearful &amp; easy in spite of the Frailties
         of its Companion. as to my own it can do neither one, nor the other; &amp; I have the
         Mortification to find my spiritual Part the most infirm Thing about me. You have doubtless
         heard of the Loss I have had in Dr. Middleton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whose House was the only easy Place one could find to converse in at Cambridge. for
         my Part I find a Friend so uncommon a Thing, that I can not help regretting even an
         old Acquaintance, wch is an indifferent Likeness of it, &amp; tho' I don't approve the
         Spirit of his Books, methinks 'tis pity the World should lose so rare a Thing as a
         good Writer.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> my Studies can not furnish a Recommendation of many new Books to you. there is a
         Defense de l'Esprit des Loix<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> by Montesquieu himself. it has some lively Things in it, but is very short, &amp; his
         Adversary<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> appears to be so mean a Bigot, that he deserved no Answer. there are 3 V: in 4to
         of, Histoire du Cabinet du Roi,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> by Mess: Buffons,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; D'Aubenton.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the first is a Man of Character, but (I am told) has hurt it by this Work. it is
         all a Sort of Introduction to Natural History. the weak Part of it is a Love of System,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch runs thro' it, the most contrary Thing in the World to a Science, entirely grounded
         upon Experiments, &amp; that has nothing to do with Vivacity of Imagination. there are
         some microscopical Observations, that seem'd curious to me, on those Animalcula to
         wch we are supposed to owe our Origin; &amp; wch he has discover'd of like Figure in Females
         not pregnant, &amp; in almost every Thing we use for Nourishment, even Vegetables, particularly
         in their Fruits &amp; Seeds. not that he allows them to be animated Bodies, but <span style="font-style:italic">Molecules organisÃ©es.</span> if you ask what that is, I can not tell; no more than I can understand a new System
         of Generation wch he builds upon it. but what I was going to commend is a general
         View he gives of the Face of the Earth, follow'd by a particular one of all known
         Nations, their peculiar Figure &amp; Manners, wch is the best Epitome of Geography I ever
         met with, &amp; wrote with Sense, &amp; Elegance: in short these Books are well worth turning
         over. the Memoires of the AbbÃ© de Mongon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in 5 V: are highly commended, but I have not seen them. he was engaged in several
         Embassies to Germany, England, &amp;c: during the Course of the late War. The Presid:
         Henault's AbregÃ© Chronol:ique de l'Hist: de France<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I believe I have before mention'd to you, as a very good Book of its Kind.</p>
      <p>You advised me in your last to be acquainted with [Keene]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; we are accordingly on very good &amp; civil Terms: but to make us love one another
         (I reckon) you hardly proposed. I always placed the Service he did me [about Tuthill]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to your Account. this latter has done him some Service, about his Regulations.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if you will give me the Pleasure of a Letter, while I continue here, it will be a
         great Satisfaction to me. I shall stay a Month longer. my best Wishes to Mrs Wharton
         &amp; your Family. I am</p>
