            <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I am extremely obliged to you [for the] kind attention you bestow on me &amp; my affairs. I have
					not been a sufferer by this calamity: it was on the other side of the street, &amp; did not reach so
					far as the houses opposite to mine: but there was an Attorney, who had writings belonging to me in
					his hands, that had his house burnt down among the first: yet he has had the good fortune to save all his papers. the fire is said to
					have begun in the chamber of that poor Glass-Organist who lodged at a Coffee-house in
						Swithin's-Alley, &amp; perish'd in the flames. two other Persons were destroy'd (in the charitable
					office of assisting their friends) by the fall of some buildings. last night there was another fire in Lincolns Inn Fields, that burnt
					the Sardinian Ambassador's Chappel &amp; Stables with some adjacent houses. 'tis strange, that we all
					of us (here in Town) lay ourselves down every night on our Funeral Pile ready made, &amp; compose ourselves to rest; while every
					drunken Footman, &amp; drowsy Old-Woman, has a candle ready to light it before the morning.
				</p>
         <p>You will have heard of Hawke's Victory before this can reach you (perhaps by an Express). [the Soleil Royal], Monsr de Conflans
					own Ship of [80 guns, &amp; the Hero of] 74, were driven on Shore &amp; [subsequently burnt], two sunk (capital Ships) with [all their crews, fo]r it blew a storm during the whole [day, so that none] could be saved out of
					them. eight [after throwin]g over their cannon were able to run [into th]e mouth of a shallow river
					(where, if the [wi]nd will permit, it is probable, they may be set on fire) &amp; eight ran away, &amp; are supposed to have got into
					Rochefort. two of Hawke's Fleet (of 70 &amp; 60 guns) out of eagerness ran aground, &amp; are lost,
					but most of the Men preserved, &amp; brought off. there is an end of the invasion, unless you are
					afraid of Thurot, who is hovering off Scotland. it is an odd contemplation, that <hi rend="italic">somebody</hi>
					 should have lived long enough to grow a great &amp; glorious Monarch. as to the Nation, I fear, it
					will not know how to behave itself, being just in the circumstances of a Chambermaid, that has got the 20,000Â£ Prize in the
					Lottery.</p>
         <p>You mistake me; I was always a Friend to <hi rend="italic">Employment,</hi> &amp; no Foe to Money: but they are no friends to each
					other. promise me to be always busy, &amp; I will allow you to be rich.</p>

            <salute>I am Dear Mason, in all situations truly<lb/> Yours. </salute>
