				     <p>I should say Mr Inspector general of the Exports &amp; Imports, but that appellation would make but
					an odd figure in conjunction with the two familiar monosyllables above written, for, Non bene conveniunt, nec in un√¢ sede morantur
					Majestas &amp; amor, which is being interpreted, Love does not live at the Custom-house: however by
					what style, title, or denomination soever you please to be dignified or distinguish'd hereafter, you'll never get rid of these two
					words, nor of your christian-name: it will stick like a Burr, &amp; you can no more get quitt of it, than St Anthony could of his Pigg:
					we had no Queen to bury here, so I have no procession to tell you of; but we are collecting our
					flowers, as fast as may be, to strew upon her tomb: Mr Pemberton of
					Cath: Hall &amp; one Ambrose of Trin: Hall, a blind Man, they say will bear away the bell; both
					English; Mr Whitehead does not shine vastly this time: the bellman has paid his duty in the following
					epigram. </p>
				     <q>
					       <p>Oh cruel death! how could'st be so unkind <lb/> To snatch the Queen, &amp; leave the King behind? </p>
				     </q>
				     <p>almost as Laconick, as Mr Conways letter; who has wrought to his
						sister in the same style, as one would write to the devil whose ancient title has been, Old Boy:,</p>
