      <p>I learn Italian like any dragon, and in two months am got through the 16th book of
         Tasso, whom I hold in great admiration: I want you to learn too, that I may know your
         opinion of him; nothing can be easier than that language to any one who knows Latin
         and French already, and there are few so copious and expressive.
