      </div>
      <p>        I received M<span class="super">r</span> Talbot's letter from Bath, &amp; hear today, that he is return'd to Cambridge. I should
         write to him, had I anything worth his notice, that I could tell him in a letter.
         I hope, he continues to feel the good effects of his journey.<br />         You probably know as well as I do, that the M: of Rockingham has given a
         considerable living, Keeton (I think, is its name) in Huntingd:<span class="super">n[s?]</span> worth near 300£ a-year, tenable with his Mastership, to the V: Chancellour. it is
         just under the nose of Hinchinbroke &amp; Kimbolton, &amp; comes very a-propos in all respects.
         I desire to know the policy of Trinity-Hall. there are 10 fellows (not insane) that
         elect, and I hear 5, if not 6, of them are Candidates for the Mastership, among w<span class="super">ch</span> Mat. Robinson is one. D<span class="super">r</span> Calvert (I hear) has got the Chancellorship of Worcester.
      </p>
      <p>        I am sorry to tell you, that the tragical story of the Prisoners in India,
         with those sad circumstances you saw in the Papers comes from M<span class="super">r</span> Pigot lately return'd from thence. it is true, he had his intelligence from a Black
         Native of the Country concerning their fate: but it is generally believed here. Clive
         embarks on Tuesday.<br />         You will oblige me in sending Sally's account (I mean the sum total) as soon
         as you are able, for I know not how soon I shall leave London. Nicholls tells me,
         you are well, &amp; walk to Ditton.
