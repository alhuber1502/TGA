         <div class="salute">My good West </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am qualified with full and ample powers to treat with you in the names of HW and
         TA ;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but as you thought fit to begin with me, I shall think fit to begin with myself:
         there can be no excuse made for the backwardness of my payments, but Poverty; alas!
         Master, times are so hard, and trading so bad, that now &amp; then a Pepper Corn is all
         [we] can pretend to; but if your Worship would call, as you come this way [you] shall
         be as welcome to a rasher of Bacon, &amp; a pitcher of drink, as the Lord Mayor of Londonâ&#x80;&#x93;in
         short I depend upon seeing you here next month[:] we have indeed nothing to shew you,
         but three old faces, that you have been long used to, tho' perhaps you may find something
         new even in them; as for me, I shall be incessantly painting my eyes, &amp; tiring my
         head, &amp; looking out at the window in expectation of your wheels; so pray let your
         driving, be as the driving of Jehu, the Son of Nimshi: Mr Conway<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been here about a fortnight, &amp; the little Insensible was neither struck with
         Kings-Chappel, nor moved with Trinity-Quadrangle, nor touched with the Senate-house,
         &amp; even talked of Oxford, as he was walking on Clare-hall Walks; we expect you should
         be moved, struck, &amp; touched with every thing you see here; we have pulled down half
         my College,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that you may have fewer Fibs to tell, when y[ou] begin to praise it; you are to suppose
         the demolish'd to have been the best part of it, &amp; that, that is to be built, you
         may say all the fine things you please about: we have put our trees in their best
         green Liverys, [or]der'd the Sun to clear our Air, Walpole's Greyhound has got a new
         Collar, [his?] Cat has learn'd to dance, and all this against you come: we can't keep
         [our] best looks &amp; manners long, so make hast, I charge you: Leonidas,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to tell you all that I think of it, not to conceal my judgement in any point, is
         really, excessively â&#x80;&#x94;, I particularly admire that noble passage in the â&#x80;&#x94;th Book,
         Line the â&#x80;&#x94;th, &amp; then, then the Pathos in that speech of â&#x80;&#x94; to â&#x80;&#x94;, &amp; the Simile
         concerning the â&#x80;&#x94;, so applicable to the present State of Affairs, and most people
         that I have met with, I find perfectly of my opinion in this; for those who admire
         it, &amp; those, who do not; joyn in thinking the above-mention'd passages perfectly fine:
         what think you of Mr Pope's, Cum tot sustineas<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c: to me, much preferable to, Flore bono<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c: &amp; pray have you read, the Spleen,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> publish'd sometime ago; bad enough taken altogether perhaps; but if you pull it to
         pieces, you may find pretty picking, &amp; Scraps of great beauty: the Essay on Conversation<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is by no means contemptible: if you direct letters to me out of malice, I will give
         you all possible provocations; we excuse your Epigram<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> upon condition you always fill up your backsides in the same manner; my backside
         is too broad to be cover'd with an Epigram, so I'll tell you a story; you must know,
         that Rinaldo<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was lost, [so?] one Carlo &amp; Ubaldo went to look for him, they did not know where;
         &amp; so</p>

         <p>Dismiss'd at length, they break thro' all delay <br /> To tempt the dangers of the doubtfull way: <br /> And first to Ascalon their steps they bend, <br /> Whose walls along the neighbouring Sea extend; <br /> Nor yet in prospect rose the distant Shore, <br /> Scarce the hoarse waves from far were heard to roar; <br /> When thwart the road a river roll'd his<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> flood<br /> Tempestuous, and all further course withstood: <br /> The torrent stream his ancient bounds disdains <br /> Swoln with new force, &amp; late-descending rains: <br /> Irresolute they stand; when lo, appears <br /> A<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wondrous Sage; vig'rous he seems<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in years,<br /> Awful his mien, low as his feet there flows <br /> A vestment unadorn'd, tho' white as new fal'n Snows: <br /> Against the stream the wave<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> secure he trod;<br /> His head a chaplet bore, his hand a Rod.</p> 
         <p>As on the Rhine, when Boreas' fury reigns, <br /> And winter binds the floods in icy chains; <br /> Swift shoots the village-Maid with<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> rustick play<br /> Smooth, without step adown the shining way, <br /> Fearless in long excursion loves to glide, <br /> And sports, and wantons o'er the frozen tide. <br /> So moved the Seer; but on no harden'd plain, <br /> The river boil'd beneath, &amp; rush'd into<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Main:<br /> Where fix'd in wonder stood the warlike pair <br /> His course he turn'd, &amp; thus relieved their care.</p> 
         <p>Vast, oh my friends, &amp; difficult's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the toil<br /> To seek your hero in a distant Soil; <br /> No common helps, no common guide ye need, <br /> Art it requires, &amp; more than winged speed: <br /> What length of Sea remains, what various lands, <br /> Oceans untried,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> inhospitable Sands?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <br /> For adverse fate the captive Chief has hurl'd <br /> Beyond the confines of our narrow world: <br />Great things &amp; full of wonder in your ears <br /> I shall reveal;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but first dismiss your fears,<br /> Nor doubt with me to tread the downward road, <br /> That to the grotto leads, my dark abode.</p> 
         <p>Scarce had he said, before the warriours eyes <br /> When mountain-high the waves disparted rise; <br /> The flood on either hand its billows rears, <br /> And in the midst a spatious arch appears: <br /> Their hands he seized, &amp; down the Steep he led <br /> Beneath th'obedient rivers inmost bed. <br /> The watry glimm'rings of a fainter day <br /> Discover'd half, &amp; half conceal'd their way, <br /> As when athwart the dusky woods by night <br /> Th' uncertain Crescent gleams a sickly light.</p> 
         <p>Thro' subterraneous passages they went, <br /> Earth's inmost cells, &amp; [caves o]f deep descent. <br /> Of many a spring<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> they vi[ew]d the secret source,<br /> The birth of rivers, rising t[o] their course; <br /> How infant-springs in mazy wandrings stream<br /> Pregnant of many a tide, &amp; floods of mighty name;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> Whate'er with copious train its channel fills, <br /> Floats into lakes, or bubbles into rills: <br /> The Po was there to see, Euphrates'<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Bed,<br /> And Danube's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> fount, &amp; Nile's mysterious head.</p> 
         <p>Further they pass where ripening minerals glow,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> And embryon metals undigested flow,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> Sulphureous veins, &amp; living Silver shine, <br /> Which soon the parent Suns warm powers refine, <br /> In one rich mass unite the pretious Store, <br /> The parts combine &amp; harden into Oar. <br /> Here gems break thro' the night with glitt'ring beam, <br /> And paint the margin of the costly Stream: <br /> All stones of lustre shoot their vivid ray, <br /> And mix attempred in a various day: <br /> Here the soft emerald smiles of verdant hue <br />Here rubies flame with Sapph[ires] heavenly blew; <br /> The diamond there attracts the wondring sight, <br /> Proud in<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> its thousand dies, &amp; luxury of light.</p>
