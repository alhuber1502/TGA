      <p>I thank you for your intelligence about Herculaneum, which was the first news I received
         of it. I have since turned over Monsignor Baiardi's book, where I have learned how
         many grains of modern wheat the Roman Congius, in the Capitol, holds, and how many
         thousandth parts of an inch the Greek foot consisted of more (or less, for I forget
         which) than our own. He proves also by many affecting examples, that an Antiquary
         may be mistaken: That, for any thing any body knows, this place under ground might
         be some other place, and not Herculaneum; but nevertheless, that he can shew for certain,
         that it was this place and no other place; that it is hard to say which of the several
         Hercules's was the founder; therefore (in the third volume) he promises to give us
         the memoirs of them all; and after that, if we do not know what to think of the matter,
         he will tell us. There is a great deal of wit too, and satire and verses, in the book,
         which is intended chiefly for the information of the French King, who will be greatly
         edified without doubt.

      <p>I am much obliged to you also for Voltaire's performance; it is very unequal, as he
         is apt to be in all but his dramas, and looks like the work of a man that will admire
         his retreat and his Leman-Lake no longer than till he finds an opportunity to leave
         it: However, though there be many parts which I do not like, yet it is in several
         places excellent, and every where above mediocrity. As you have the politeness to
         pretend impatience, and desire I would communicate, and all that, I annex a piece
         of the Prophecy; which must be true at least, as it was wrote so many hundred years
         after the events.
