      <p>You will make my best acknowledgements to Mr Howe, who not content to rank me in the
         number of his Friends is so polite as to make excuses for having done me that honour.
      </p>
      <p>I was not born so <span style="font-style:italic">far from the Sun</span>  as to be ignorant of Count Algarotti's name &amp; reputation; nor am I so far advanced
         in years or in philosophy, as not to feel the warmth of his approbation. the odes
         in question, as their motto shews, were meant to be <span style="font-style:italic">vocal to the Intelligent alone.</span>  how few <span style="font-style:italic">they</span> were in my own country, Mr Howe can testify; &amp; yet my ambition was terminated by
         that small circle. I have good reason to be proud, if my voice has reach'd the ear
         &amp; apprehension of a Stranger distinguish'd as one of the best Judges in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>I am equally pleased with the just applause he bestows on Mr Mason, &amp; particularly
         on the Caractacus, wch is the work of a Man: whereas the Elfrida is only that of a
         Boy, a promising boy indeed, &amp; of no common Genius: yet this is the popular performance
         with us, &amp; the other little known in comparison. 
      </p>
      <p>Neither Count Algarotti, nor Mr Howe (I believe) have heard of <span style="font-style:italic">Ossian, the Son of Fingal.</span>  if Mr H: were not upon the wing, &amp; on his way homewards, I would send it to him
         in Italy. he would there see, that Imagination dwelt many hundred years agoe in all
         her pomp on the cold and barren mountains of Scotland. the truth (I believe) is that
         without any respect of climates she reigns in all nascent societies of Men, where
         the necessities of life force every one to think &amp; act much for himself ..
