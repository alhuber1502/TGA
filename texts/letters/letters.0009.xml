					 Tityre, dum patulæ recubo sub tegmine fagi<lb/>
            <lb/> Though you'll think perhaps it's a little too cold weather for giving oneself languishing airs
					under a tree; however supposing it's by the fireside, it will be full as well; so as I was going to say –but, I believe, I was
					going to say nothing, so I must begin over again– </opener>

				     <p>Yesterday morning, (being the morning I set apart for lying abed till one aclock) I was waked about ten with hollowing &amp; the
					Noise of a Bagpipe at the door; so I got up, &amp; open'd the door, &amp; saw all the court full of strange appearances: at first I
					concluded 'twas you with a whole Masquerade at your heels, but upon more mature deliberation imagined it might be Amadis de Gaul come
					to set me free from this enchanted Castle with his train of conquer'd Monsters &amp; Oddities: the first, whom I took for the Knight in
					person, had his face painted after the manner of ye ancient Britains. he played melodiously on the aforenamed Instrument, &amp; had a
					Plow upon his Back; what it meant, I did not apprehend at first: he said nothing at all, but made many very significant Grimaces:
					before him &amp; on each side a Number of Folks cover'd over with Tags &amp; Points form'd themselves into a Country Dance: there
					follow'd something, which I apprehended was the beauteous Oriana, in a white Dimoty Petticoat &amp;
					Boddice; her head &amp; face were veil'd: she was supported by her two Gentlemen-ushers, &amp; seem'd to be very obstreperous, for she
					struggled &amp; kicked, &amp; snorted, &amp; fizzled: I concluded she was falling in fits, &amp; was running with my Hungary water
						Bottle: when she was so violent, that she got loose from her Attendants, &amp; run away upon all
					fours into the middle of ye Court, &amp; her hood falling off discover'd a large pair of Ears. in short, Oriana was metamorphosed into
					a very genteel Jack-ass: upon this the whole crowd set up a great Shout of, God speed the Plough. after all I was inform'd by a Negro
					Gentlewoman with a very long beard, who had a great deal to do in the Ceremony, that it was Plough-Monday, &amp; that all this was the Custom of the Country; they march in this manner thro' all the Colledges in
					Town. the Term is now begun again, &amp; I have made such a wonderful progress in Philosophy, that I begin to be quite persuaded, that
					black is white, &amp; that fire will not burn, &amp; that I ought not, either to give credit to my eyes or feeling; they tell me too,
					that I am nothing in the world, &amp; that I only fancy, I exist: do but come to me quickly &amp; one lesson of thine, my dear
					Philosopher, will restore me to the use of my Senses, &amp; make me think myself something, as long as I am</p>

					       <p>P:S: the inclosed is the oath of Matriculation. I am charmed with Popes Letter – never did any body long for anything, as I do for your Masquerade; pray d'ye design to go, as a
						Judge, or a Devil; or undisguised: or as an Angel in propriâ Personâ. I wonder how you can dislike
						the Distressed Mother– [           ]
