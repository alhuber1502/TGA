					       <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>What can I say more to you about Oddington. you seem engaged to Mr Wood, &amp; in consequence of that to Mr Meller. Mr Br: is not here, &amp; (if he
					were) I could by no means consult him about it: his view to the Mastership will be affected by it just
					in the same manner, as if he had accepted of Framlingham, &amp; had it in possession, wch I little
					doubt he would accept, if it were vacant &amp; undisputed. as to the dubious title he told me of it
					himself, &amp; I was surprised at it, as a thing quite new to me. this is all I know, nor (if you were under no previous engagement)
					could I <hi rend="italic">direct,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">determine</hi> your choice: it ought to be entirely your own, as to accept
					or refuse ought to be entirely his. the only reason I have suggested any thing about it is, that (when we first talk'd on this subject)
					you ask'd me, whether Mr B: would have it, &amp; I replied, it would hardly be worth his while, as Framl:m was of greater value, in wch
					(all things consider'd) I may be mistaken.</p>
				     <p>I give you joy of your vase: I can not find P. et P. PA. in my Sertorius Ursatus, &amp; consequently
					do not know their meaning. what shall I do? My learned Brethren are dispersed over the face of the earth. I have lately dug up three
					small vases, in workmanship at least equal to yours: they were discover'd at a place call'd Burslem in Staffordshire, &amp; are very
					little impair'd by time. on the larger one is this inscription very legible 9/,
					 &amp; on the two smaller this 7/. you will oblige me with an
					explanation, for Ursatus here too leaves us in the dark.</p>
				     <p>I fear the K: of Denmark could not stay, till your hair was dress'd. he is a genteel lively figure,
					not made by nature for a Fool: but surrounded by a pack of Knaves, whose interest it is to make him one, if they can. he has overset
					poor Dr Marriot's head here, who raves of nothing else from morning till night.</p>
				     <p>Pray make my best compliments to your Brother-Residentiary Mr Cowper, &amp; thank him for his
					obliging letter of congratulation, wch I did not at all expect: present also my respects &amp; acknowledgements to Miss Patty. Mr
					Bedingfield I shall answer soon, both as to his civilities &amp; his reproaches: the latter you might have prevented by telling him,
					that I gave my <hi rend="italic">works</hi> to no body, as it was only a new edition.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu, &amp; write to me.<lb/> I am ever <lb/> Yours</salute>
