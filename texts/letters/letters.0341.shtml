         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>I have at last found rest<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for the sole of my gouty foot in your own old Dining-room,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; hope in spite of the damnation denounced by the Bishop's two Chaplains,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that you may find at least an equal satisfaction &amp; repose at Old-Park.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if your Bog<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> prove as comfortable as my Oven,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I shall see no occasion to pity you; &amp; only wish that you may <span style="font-style:italic">brew</span> no worse, than I <span style="font-style:italic">bake.</span> you totally mistake my talents, when you impute to me any magical skill in planting
         roses. I know, I am no Conjuror<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in these things; when they are done, I can find fault, &amp; that is all. now this is
         the very reverse of Genius, &amp; I feel my own littleness. reasonable People know themselves
         better, than is commonly imagined; &amp; therefore (tho' I never saw any instance of it)
         I believe Mason, when he tells me he understands planting better, than anything whatever.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the <span style="font-style:italic">prophetic eye of Taste</span> (as Mr. Pitt<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> call'd it) sees all the beauties, that a Place is susceptible of, long before they
         are born; &amp; when it plants a seedling, already sits under the shadow of it, &amp; enjoys
         the effect it will have from every point of view, that lies in prospect. you must
         therefore invoke Caractacus, &amp; he will send his Spirits<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> from the top of Snowdon to Cross-Fell,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or Warden-Law.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>The Thermometer is in the Passage-Window (where the Sun never comes) near the head
         of the Back-Stairs. since you went, I have never observed it lower than 68, most part
         of the day at 74, &amp; yesterday at 5 in ye afternoon it was at 79, the highest I have
         ever seen it. it now is prepared to correspond regularly with you at the hours you
         mention. the Weather for this fortnight has been broiling without interruption, one
         thunder-shower excepted, wch did not cool the air at all. Rye (I am told) is begun
         to be cut near London. in Cambridgeshire a fortnight ago the promise of harvest was
         the finest I ever saw, but the Farmers complain (I hear) that the ears do not fill
         for want of wet: the Wheat was then turning yellow. Duke-Cherries<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are over in London; 3 days ago they sold for half-a-crown a Pound. Caroons<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Black-Hearts very large &amp; fine drive about the streets in wheel-barrows a penny
         a pound. Raspberries a few are yet remaining, but in a manner over. Melons are ripe,
         &amp; Apricots &amp; Orleans-Plums are to be seen in the fruitshops. Roses are (I think) over
         a week ago. the Jessamine (at Mrs Dod's on a S:W: Wall) was in full bloom (if you
         remember) long before you went from hence, &amp; so it continues. that below in the Garden
         on a N:E: Wall has been all this week cover'd with flowers. my nosegays from Covent-Garden
         consist of nothing but Scarlet-Martagons, Everlasting-Peas, Double-Stocks, Pinks,
         &amp; flowering Marjoram: as I have kept no exact account hitherto this year, I can say
         no more of July, that now is. therefore I shall annex one for the year 1754, wch I
         observed day by day at Stoke. observe, it had been then a cold rainy Summer.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>The heat was very moderate this month, &amp; a great deal of rain fell. the sown Hay was
         all got in by the first day, but the meadow-hay was not before ye 23d. it was very
         good &amp; in plenty, but sold at 40 shillings a load in the field on account of the scarcity
         the year preceding. Barley was in ear on the first day; grey and white Peas in bloom.
         the Bean flowers were going off. Duke-Cherries in plenty on the 5th; Hearts were also
         ripe. green Melons on the 6th, but watry, &amp; not sweet. Currants begun to ripen on
         the 8th, &amp; red Goose-berries had changed colour; Tares were then in flower, &amp; Meadow-Hay
         cutting. Lime-trees in full bloom on the 9th. Mushrooms in perfection on the 17th.
         Wheat &amp; Oats had changed colour, &amp; Buck-Wheat was in bloom on the 19th. the Vine had
         then open'd its blossoms, &amp; the end of ye month Grapes were near ye size of small
         Pease. Turneps appear'd above ground on the 22d; &amp; Potatoes were in flower. Barley
         had changed its hue, &amp; Rye was almost ripe on the 23d. The Pine-apple-Strawberry was
         then in perfection. Black Caroons were ripe, &amp; some Duke-Cherries still remain'd on
         walls the 26th, but the Hearts were then all spoil'd by the rain. Gooseberries red
         &amp; white were then ripe, &amp; Currants in abundance. </p>

      <p>Every body continues as quiet about the Invasion, as if a Frenchman, as soon as he

         what is the damage, that Rodney has done,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whether much or little: he can only guess himself; &amp; the French have kept their own
         secret, as yet. of the 12 Millions, raised for the year, eight are gone already, &amp;
         the old Party assure us, there is no more to be had for next year. you may easily
         guess at the source<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of my intelligence, &amp; therefore will not talk of it. News is hourly expected of a
         Battle in Westphalia, for Pr: Ferdinand was certainly preparing to fight the French,
