         <div class="salute">Dear Sr</div>
      </div>
      <p>It is true, I have been lately a very indifferent Correspondent, but Poverty knows
         no law, &amp; must be my excuse. since the fortnight I pass'd with Mason at York (who
         was then very bad with that troublesome defluxion in his eyes, and is since cured
         &amp; now stands on the brink of marriage),<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have been always resident at Old Park, excursions excepted of a day or two at a
         time, and one lately of three weeks to Hartlepool.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the rocks, the sea, &amp; the weather there, more than made up to me the want of bread
         &amp; the want of water, two capital defects, but of wch I learn'd from the inhabitants
         not to be sensible. they live on the refuse of their own fish-market, with a few potatoes,
         &amp; a reasonable quantity of Geneva, six days in the week, &amp; I have nowhere seen a taller,
         more robust, or healthy race. every house full of ruddy broad-faced children. nobody
         dies but of drowning or old age. nobody poor but from drunkenness, or mere laziness.
         I had long wish'd for a storm, and was treated before I came away with such a one
         as July could produce: but the waves did not rise above twelve foot high, &amp; there
         was no hurt done. on Monday (I believe) I go to Scotland with my Lord, and Tom,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the Major.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> No Ladies are of the party: they remain at Hetton:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> yet I do not expect to see anything, for we go post, till I come to Glamis.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I hear of P:s<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> safe arrival in England: Pray congratulate him from me, &amp; beg, he would not give
         away all his pictures and gems, till I come. I hope to see him in October. is it true
         that young Tyrrell<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> does not goe into orders? Dr. Hallifax<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (who was here with Dr. Lowth)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> tells me, that Ridlington<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is on his way to Nice. The last letter you sent me was from Mr. Ramsay, a Tenant
         of mine in Cornhill, who wants to see me <span style="font-style:italic">anent</span> particular business. as I know not what it is I go with a little uneasiness on my
         mind farther North: but what can one do? I have told him my situation.
      </p>
      <p>The Doctor &amp; Mrs. Wharton wish for you often, tho' in vain. such is your perverseness!
         Adieu; I will write again from Scotland more at large.
