         <div class="salute">Dear Sr</div>
      </div>
      <p>It is true, I have been lately a very indifferent Correspondent, but Poverty knows
         no law, &amp; must be my excuse. since the fortnight I pass'd with Mason at York (who
         was then very bad with that troublesome defluxion in his eyes, and is since cured
         &amp; now stands on the brink of marriage), I have been always resident at Old Park, excursions
         excepted of a day or two at a time, and one lately of three weeks to Hartlepool. the
         rocks, the sea, &amp; the weather there, more than made up to me the want of bread &amp; the
         want of water, two capital defects, but of wch I learn'd from the inhabitants not
         to be sensible. they live on the refuse of their own fish-market, with a few potatoes,
         &amp; a reasonable quantity of Geneva, six days in the week, &amp; I have nowhere seen a taller,
         more robust, or healthy race. every house full of ruddy broad-faced children. nobody
         dies but of drowning or old age. nobody poor but from drunkenness, or mere laziness.
         I had long wish'd for a storm, and was treated before I came away with such a one
         as July could produce: but the waves did not rise above twelve foot high, &amp; there
         was no hurt done. on Monday (I believe) I go to Scotland with my Lord, and Tom, &amp;
         the Major. No Ladies are of the party: they remain at Hetton: yet I do not expect
         to see anything, for we go post, till I come to Glamis.
      </p>
      <p>I hear of P:s safe arrival in England: Pray congratulate him from me, &amp; beg, he would
         not give away all his pictures and gems, till I come. I hope to see him in October.
         is it true that young Tyrrell does not goe into orders? Dr. Hallifax (who was here
         with Dr. Lowth) tells me, that Ridlington is on his way to Nice. The last letter you
         sent me was from Mr. Ramsay, a Tenant of mine in Cornhill, who wants to see me <span style="font-style:italic">anent</span> particular business. as I know not what it is I go with a little uneasiness on my
         mind farther North: but what can one do? I have told him my situation.
      </p>
      <p>The Doctor &amp; Mrs. Wharton wish for you often, tho' in vain. such is your perverseness!
         Adieu; I will write again from Scotland more at large.
      </p>
