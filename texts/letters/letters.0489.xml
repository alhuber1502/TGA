            <salute>Dear Mason </salute>

         <p>Dr Swift says, one never should write to one's Friends but in high health &amp; spirits. by the way
					it is the last thing people in those circumstances usually think of doing: but it is sure, if I were to wait for them, I never should
					write at all. at present I have had for these six weeks a something growing in my throat, wch nothing does any service to, &amp; wch
					will, I suppose, in due time stop up the passage. I go however about, &amp; the pain is very little. you will say perhaps, the malady
					is as little, &amp; the stoppage is in the imagination. no matter for that! if it is not sufficient to prove want of health (for indeed
					this is all I ail) it is so much the stronger proof of the want of spirits. so take it as you please, I carry my point, &amp; shew you,
					that it is very obliging in me to write at all. indeed perhaps on your account, I should not have done it: but after three such weeks
					of Lapland-weather I can not but enquire after Mrs Mason's health. if she has withstood such a winter &amp; her cough never the worse:
					she may defy the Doctors &amp; all their works. pray, tell me how she is, for I interest myself for her not merely on your account, but
					on her own. these three last mornings have been very vernal &amp; mild: has she tasted the air of the new year at least in
					Hyde-Park?</p>
         <p>Mr Brown will wait on her next week, &amp; touch her. he has been confined to lie on a couch, &amp;
					under the Surgeon's hands eversince the first of January with a broken shin ill-doctor'd. he is just now got abroad, &amp; obliged to
					come to Town about Monday on <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> business.</p>
         <p>Stonhewer was so kind as to tell me the mystery now accomplish'd, before I received your letter. I rejoice in all his
						accessions: I wish, you would persuade him to take unto him a Wife: but don't let her be a fine Lady.
					Adieu. present my respects &amp; good wishes to Argentile.</p>
