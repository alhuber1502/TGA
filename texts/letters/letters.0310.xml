         <p>It is indeed for want of spirits, as you suspect, that my studies lie among the Cathedrals, and the Tombs, and the Ruins. To think, though to little purpose, has been the chief amusement of my days; and when I would
					not, or cannot think, I dream. At present I find myself able to write a Catalogue, or to read the
					Peerage book, or Miller's Gardening Dictionary, and am thankful that there are such employments and
					such authors in the world. Some people, who hold me cheap for this, are doing perhaps what is not half so well worth while. As to
					posterity, I may ask, (with some body whom I have forgot) what has it ever done to oblige me?</p>
         <p>To make a transition from myself to as poor a subject, the Tragedy of Agis; I cry to think that it
					should be by the Author of Douglas: Why, it is all modern Greek; the story is an antique statue painted white and red, frized, and
					dressed in a neglig√©e made by a Yorkshire mantua-maker. Then here is the Miscellany (Mr Dodsley has
					sent me the whole set gilt and lettered, I thank him). Why, the two last volumes are worse than the four first; particularly Dr
						Akenside is in a deplorable way. What signifies Learning and the Antients, (Mason will say
					triumphantly) why should people read Greek to lose their imagination, their ear, and their mother tongue? But then there is Mr
						Shenstone, who trusts to nature and simple sentiment, why does he do no better? he goes hopping along
					his own gravel-walks, and never deviates from the beaten paths for fear of being lost.</p>
         <p>I have read Dr Swift, and am disappointed. There is nothing of the negotiations that I have not seen
					better in M. de Torcy before. The manner is careless, and has little to distinguish it from common
					writers. I meet with nothing to please me but the spiteful characters of the opposite party and its leaders. I expected much more
					secret history. </p>
