					       <dateline>Jermyn Street, <lb/> Thursday, October 25, 1764. </dateline>
					       <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I am returned from Southampton, since Monday last; have been at Salisbury, Wilton, Stonehenge, and where not, and am not at all the
					worse for my expedition. Delly has been here, and talks of going to
					Cambridge on Wednesday, if you want him; but, if you do not, would be glad to be prevented by a letter. His intention is only to stay
					there a day or two. He asked me for my rooms, but as I had (intentionally) promised them to Mr. Mapletoft, I answered as if I had actually been engaged on that head, and had already wrote to you to say so. If Mr.
					Mapletoft does not come, they are at Mr. Delly's service.</p>
				     <p>The present news is that Lady Harriet Wentworth (Lord Rockingham's sister), not a young or a beautiful maiden, has married her servant, an Irish footman.
				</p>
				     <p>Mr. [M:], who has been in Yorkshire, has seen the future bride.
					She has just such a nose as Mason has himself; so you see it was made in heaven.</p>
				     <p>The rent-roll of the present Duke of Devonshire's estate is £44,000 a-year. Lord Richard has better than £4000 a-year; Lady Dorothy £30,000; a legacy of £500 to
					General Conway; £500 apiece to the three brothers, and they are
					appointed guardians, and, I think, executors – business enough, in conscience. To-day I hear the Cambridge affair is
					compromised, and Lord Hardwicke to come in quietly. This I should not give credit to had I not heard
					it before I came from thence. The Duke of Cumberland, they say, is in a very good way: it is strange
					to me if he recovers.
				</p>
				     <p>I will write soon again, and try to tell you more, for I shall stay in town about a fortnight longer. You will oblige me if you will
					send to inquire how Dolly Antrobus does.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu.–I am ever yours.</salute>
