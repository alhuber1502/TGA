         <p>If wishes could turn to realities, I would fling down my law books, and sup with you to-night. But, alas, here am I doomed to fix,
					while you are fluttering from city to city, and enjoying all the pleasures which a gay climate can afford. It is out of the power of my
					heart to envy your good fortune, yet I cannot help indulging a few natural desires; as for example, to take a walk with you on the
					banks of the Rhône, and to be climbing up mount Fourviere;</p>
         <q>
            <p>Jam mens prætrepidans avet vagari: <lb/> Jam læti studio pedes vigescunt.
					</p>
         </q>
         <p>However, so long as I am not deprived of your correspondence, so long shall I always find some pleasure in being at home. And,
					setting all vain curiosity aside, when the fit is over, and my reason begins to come to herself, I have several other powerful motives
					which might easily cure me of my restless inclinations: Amongst these, my Mother's ill state of health is not the least; which was the
					reason of our going to Tunbridge, so that you cannot expect much description or amusement from thence. Nor indeed is there much room
					for either; for all diversions there may be reduced to two articles, gaming and going to church. They were pleased to publish certain
					Tunbrigiana this season; but such ana! I believe there were never so many vile little verses put together before. So much for
					Tunbridge: London affords me as little to say. What! so huge a town as London? Yes, consider only how I live in that town. I never go
					into the gay or high world, and consequently receive nothing from thence to brighten my imagination. The busy world I leave to the
					busy; and am resolved never to talk politics till I can act at the same time. To tell old stories, or prate of old books, seems a
					little musty; and toujours Chapon bouilli, won't do. However, for want of better fare, take another little mouthful of my poetry. </p>
         <q>
            <p>O meæ jucunda comes quietis! <lb/> Quæ ferè ægrotum solita es levare <lb/> Pectus, et sensim ah! nimis ingruentes <lb/> Fallere
