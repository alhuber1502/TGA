         <div class="salute">Dear Mr Gray </div>
      </div>
      <p>I recd your last. but as I had before sent you my 2d Ode I was in hopes to have heard
         again, with your particular remarks on that. Observe the 2d Stanza, that is the 1st
         Antistrophe, I intend to alter on acct of the sameness of imagery with one in Melancholly,
         but I hope the rest will stand some words excepted, I will attempt a new Madors song
         to please you. but in my own mind, I would not have him sing there at all, on account
         of the toute ensemble for he sings all the 2d Ode &amp; also all the fourth. so Im afraid
         he'll be hoarse. I like the Idea of my fourth Ode much &amp; the preparation to it. tis
         the speech of an armed Death to the Britons. Who Mador is supposd to see &amp; hear just
         at the onset of the Battle.
      </p>
      <p>Thus. </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>CHORUS. </p> 
         <p>— but why is this <br /> Why doth our Brother Mador snatch his Harp <br /> From yonder Bough? Why this way bend his steps
         </p> 
         <p>CARACT: </p> 
         <p>He looks entranced. The Fillet bursts that bound <br /> His liberal locks. His snowy vestments fall <br /> In ampler folds, &amp; all his floating form <br /> Doth seem to glisten with Divinity. <br /> Yet is he speechless. Say thou chief of bards <br /> What is there in this airy Vacancy <br /> That thou with fiery &amp; irregular glance <br /> Should scan thus wildly? Wherefore heaves thy Breast? <br /> Why starts—
         </p> 
         <p>ODE </p> 
         <p>Hark! heard ye not yon footstep dread, <br /> That shook the Earth with Thundring tread? <br /> Twas Death. in Haste <br /> The Warrior past, <br /> High towerd his Helmed head. <br /> I markt his mail, I markd his Shield, <br /> I spyd the spar[k]ling of his spear, <br /> I saw his giant Arm the Falcion wield <br /> Courage was in his van &amp; conquest in his rear.
         </p>
      </div>
      <p> and so it goes on but without a word of Odin &amp; Valhalla. yet the general Celtic principle
         of the happiness of dying in Battle is touchd upon wch I hope is not in itself too
         Scaldic.
      </p>
      <p>I send you with this another pacquet &amp; I have another ready to follow it then I get
         to my third Ode &amp; when that is done I shall have little more than transcription. When
         you have all the MS. I would have you keep it, till I write about sending it to Mr
         Hurd. probably we may contrive it without posting. Do excuse all this <span style="font-style:italic">Caractication</span> I am seriously desirous of getting quit of him &amp; therefore must trouble you till
         I do.
      </p>
      <p>Mr Brown has writ me a long Letter about keeping my Divinity act, wch he says I must
         do next March. Do you say so too? if you do I will incontinently drown myself. till
         when
