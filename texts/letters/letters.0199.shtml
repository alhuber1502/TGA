      <p>I am not at all satisfied with the Title. to have it conceived, that I publish a Collection
         of <span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (half a dozen little Matters, four of wch too have already been printed again &amp; again)
         thus pompously adorned would make me appear very justly ridiculous. I desire it may
         be understood (wch is the truth) that the Verses are only subordinate, &amp; explanatory
         to the Drawings, &amp; suffer'd by me to come out thus only for that reason. therefore
         if you yourself prefix'd this Title, I desire it may be alter'd; or if Mr W: order'd
         it so, that you would tell him, why I wish it were changed in the manner I mention'd
         to you at first, or to that purpose: for the more I consider it, the less I can bear
         it, as it now stands. I even think, there is an uncommon sort of Simplicity, that
         looks like affectation, in putting our plain Christian &amp; Surnames without a Mr before
         them;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but this (if it signifies any thing) I easily give up; the other I can not. you need
         not apprehend, that this Change in the Title will be any prejudice to the Sale of
         the book. a showy title-page may serve to sell a Pamphlet of a shilling or two; but
         this is not of a price for chance-customers, whose eye is caught in passing by a window;
         &amp; could never sell but from the notion the Town may entertain of the Merit of the
         Drawings, wch they will be instructed in by some, that understand such things.</p>
      <p>I thank you for the Offer you make me, but I shall be contented with three Copies,
         two of wch you will send me, &amp; keep the third, till I acquaint you where to send it.
         if you will let me know the exact day they will come out a little time beforehand,
         I will give you a direction. you will remember to send two copies to Dr Thomas Wharton,
         M:D: at Durham. perhaps you may have burnt my Letter, so I will again put down the
         Title </p>
