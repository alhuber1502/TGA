					       <dateline>Arlington Street Feb. 20. 1753 </dateline>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I am very sorry that the haste I made to deliver you from your uneasiness the first moment after I received your Letter, shoud have
					made me express myself in a manner to have the quite contrary effect from what I intended. You well know how rapidly and carelessly I
					always write my Letters; the note you mention was written in a still greater hurry than ordinary,
					&amp; merely to put you out of pain. I had not seen Dodsley, consequently coud only tell you that I did not doubt but he woud have no
					Objection to satisfy you, as you was willing to prevent his being a Loser by the plate. Now, from
					this declaration how is it possible for you to have for one moment put such a construction upon my words, as woud have been a downright
					stupid brutality, unprovoked? It is impossible for me to recollect my very expression, but I am confident that I have repeated the
					whole substance.</p>
				     <p>How the bookseller woud be less a Loser by being at more expense, I can easily explain to you: He feared the price of half a guinea
					woud seem too high to most purchasers; if by the expence of ten guineas more he coud make the book appear so much more rich &amp; showy
					(as I beleive I said) as to induce people to think it cheap, the profits from selling many more copies woud amply recompense him for
					his additional disbursement. </p>
				     <p>The thought of having the head engraved was entirely Dodsley's own, &amp; against my opinion, as I concluded it woud be against
					yours, which made me determine to acquaint you with it before it's appearance. </p>
				     <p>When you reflect on what I have said now, you will see very clearly, that I had &amp; coud have no other possible meaning in what I
					wrote last. you might justly have accused me of neglect, if I had deferr'd giving you all the satisfaction in my power, as soon as ever
					I knew your uneasiness. </p>
				     <p>The Head I give up. The Title I think will be wrong, &amp; not answer your purpose, for, as the Drawings are evidently calculated for
					the poems, why will the improper disposition of the Word <hi rend="italic">Designs</hi> before <hi rend="italic">Poems,</hi> make the
					Edition less yours? I am as little convinced that there is any affectation in leaving out the <hi rend="italic">Mr</hi> before your
					Names; it is a barbarous addition; the other is simple &amp; classic, a rank I cannot help thinking due to both the Poet and Painter.
					Without ranging myself among Classics, I assure you, were I to print any thing with my name, it shoud be plain Horace Walpole: <hi rend="italic">Mr</hi> is one of the Gothicisms I abominate. The Explanation was certainly added for people who have not Eyes – such are almost all who have seen Mr Bentley's
					drawings, &amp; think to compliment him by mistaking them for prints. Alas! the generality want as much to have the words <hi rend="italic">a Man, a Cock,</hi> written under his drawings, as under the most execrable hieroglyphics of Egypt or of sign post
					painters!</p>
				     <p>I will say no more now, but that you must not wonder if I am partial to you &amp; yours, when you can write as you do &amp; yet feel
					so little Vanity. I have used freedoms enough with your writings to convince you I speak truth: I praise &amp; scold Mr Bentley
					immoderately as I think he draws well or ill; I never think it worth my while to do either, especially to blame, where there are not
					generally vast Excellencies. goodnight – dont suspect me when I have no fault but impatience to make you easy. </p>
