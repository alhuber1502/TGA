      <p>I do not see, why you should suppose that <span style="font-style:italic">you</span> only are to have the privilege of being ill. for me, from the time you left me (till
         within these three days) I have been only one day out of the walls of this college.
         that day was employ'd in going to the Hills<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> by way of airing after the gout, &amp; in catching such a cold &amp; cough as has given me
         no rest night or day, &amp; has only now taken its leave of me. I sent away your letter
         to B: directly: I saw no reason against it. he was then at Aubonne near Geneva with
         his Brother, &amp; is now at Berne. the picture<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is not arrived, nor (I suppose) ever will; tho' he says, he has sent it, but by what
         conveyance, or by what hand he does not say.</p>
      <p>You do me wrong: I have thought very frequently of you, &amp; especially since Sr A: Allen's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> death. I am rather glad his family were about him, tho' I know not well why, for
         he perhaps was insensible to it. these sort of deaths are alarming to the Spectator;
         but perhaps the best for the Sufferer. I have now every day before my eyes a Woman
         of ninety, my Aunt,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who has for many years been gradually turning into chalk-stones: they are making
         their way out of the joints of both feet, &amp; the Surgeon twice a day comes to increase
         the torture. she is just as sensible &amp; as impatient of pain, &amp; as intractable as she
         was 60 years ago. she thinks not at all of death, &amp; if a mortification does not come
         to release her, may lie in this agony for months (at least) helpless &amp; bed-rid. this
         is what you call a <span style="font-style:italic">natural</span> death!</p>
      <p>It is well, you live in a dry country, but do not your lakes<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> overflow? can any thing get from Norwich<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to Blundeston? 200,000 acres are drown'd in the Fens here &amp; cattle innumerable. our
         Friends at Worcester, Gloucester, &amp;c: are sailing thro' the streets from house to
         house.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Adieu! the Post is impatient. my respects to Mrs N:,</p>
