      <p>The moving piece of ancient poetry you favour'd me with the sight of, would be sufficient,
         I must confess to deterr me, if I had any ambition of appearing among the Consolatores,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>= from all pretence to writing at this time; so long as the sad Catastrophe of the
         beautiful &amp; never-to be enough-lamented Gillian<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> dwells upon my memory: those Genius's, my friend, those mighty spirits of antiquity!
         alas, what are we to 'em? mere tinsel! mere flash! and indeed (not to dwell upon the
         moral, so feelingly inculcated in this little elegiacal narration, which 'tis impossible
         should escape the acuteness of your penetration) what can be beyond the elegant simplicity
         of the language? in the exordium the poet lays down the groundwork, &amp; foundation,
         as it were, of that beautiful fabrick he intends to erect; he does not injudiciously
         draw his inferences, after he has recounted the story; at least he does not expatiate
         much in the end; no! he leaves the mind then to ruminate at its own leisure, &amp; make
         its own applications, when it shall have recover'd itself from that sorrow, which
         every virtuous mind must feel after so woful a tale: he recommends to the ladies of
         his time a strict observance of honour &amp; chastity, who, I doubt not, received his
         advice with reverence (our modern Females would perhaps [have laug]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>'d at his gravity) he also solemnly affirms the truth of it, as well knowing the prevalence
         of truth over the mind; from whence his deep insight into Nature is sufficiently evidenced:
         at the beginning of his narration, he fixes the place of his Heroine's habitation
         in Surry;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he had undoubtedly observed in Homer, &amp; the imitators of that poet; how much we are
         ingaged in the interest of any person, who has the misfortune of falling in battle,
         by being told the place of his birth &amp; abode, as</p>

      <p>'tis true, he has not carried it quite so far as Homer in telling us, whether Gillian
         loved hunting or not, nor whether her father's house was well, or ill built; he has
         showed, as he proceeds, his generous aversion, &amp; contempt for your cockneys &amp; fluttering
         beaux of the town, so agreeable to the simplicity of the age he lived in, &amp; its uncorrupted
         innocence; by making this ill-grounded passion of Gillian's the cause of all her misfortunes,
