         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>My Old Aunt is dead<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but she has not left me so much money that I can come and make ducks &amp; drakes in
         the Minikin.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> You will say I need not, I have only to teach Dr Wharton how to make them. Perhaps
         my metaphor was not well chosen, tis however as good as yours where you say Old Park
         must die a maid if I dont come &amp; lay her <span style="font-style:italic">out.</span> When Mr Hurd comes to publish our correspondence I know what will be his Note upon
         this passage, "To have made the allusion appear with due congruity the Poet should
         have written lay her <span style="font-style:italic">down</span> for to lay her <span style="font-style:italic">out</span> supposes her to be already dead wch the premises inform us this old Maid was not,
         &amp; therefore only wanted to be <span style="font-style:italic">laid down.</span> As the Passage now stands there is an impropriety in it wch evn the freedom of the
         Epistolary mode of writing will not Justify." Take another Note from Dr Balguy: "There
         are two Vernacular Phrases wch we apply seperately, &amp; wch indeed will not admit of
         a reciprocal usage in our tongue. the one we apply constantly where any thing is predicated
         concerning Gardening &amp; the other we as constantly use as a term in Agriculture. Thus
         we lay <span style="font-style:italic">out</span> pleasure Grounds but we lay <span style="font-style:italic">down</span> feild Lands. Now had the writer deliverd the above sentiment without a figure he
         would have simply said Old Park wants to be <span style="font-style:italic">laid out,</span> &amp; here as Old Park means a pleasure ground or Garden, the Phrase would have been
         just &amp; pertinent. But he chose to personify Old park &amp; to speak of her under the figure
         of an Old Maid, &amp; hence arose the incongruity which the Critic has so justly stigmatizd,
         &amp; wch would not have appeard so had Old Park been a common feild; but unhappily for
         the writer, Old Park was (as we have seen) a pleasure ground, or garden and as such
         requird to be <span style="font-style:italic">laid out</span> not to be <span style="font-style:italic">laid down,</span> hence it would not admit of the Metaphor in quÃ¦stion, &amp; I know no way of reducing
         this passage into the rules of <span style="font-style:italic">chast</span> Composition but by supposing Old Park <span style="font-style:italic">arable;</span> then the figure will be in its place, &amp; the <span style="font-style:italic">Maid</span> will be <span style="font-style:italic">laid down</span> in a <span style="font-style:italic">natural</span> &amp; even <span style="font-style:italic">elegant</span> manner."</p>
      <p>Explicit Nonsenseâ&#x80;&#x93;&amp; now what remains must be serious. I dined lately at Bishopthorpe<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when the Archbishop<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> took me into his Closet &amp; with many tears, begd me to write an Epitaph on his daughter.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> In our conversation he touchd so many unison Strings of my heart (for we both of
         us wept like childern) that I could not help promising him that I would try if possible
         to oblige him. The result you have on the opposite page, if it either is, or can be
         made a decent thing assist me with your Judgment immediatly, for what I do about it
         I would do quickly, &amp; I can do nothing neither, if this will not do with correction.
         It cannot be expected, neither would I wish it, to be equal to what I have written
         from my heart, upon my Hearts heart<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> â&#x80;&#x93;Give me I beg your sentiments upon it as soon as possible. to conclude I wish
         heartily to be with you but cannot fix a time For I was obligd to invite Mr Robinson<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the Wordsworths<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> hither, &amp; I have not recd their answer. In my next perhaps I can speak more detirminately.
         My best Compliments to Dr &amp; Mrs Wharton &amp; best wishes for the continuance of Mr Browns
         beatifications.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>

            <p>EPITAPH ON MISS DRUMMOND </p> 
            <p>Hence stoic Apathy to hearts of Stone! <br /> A Christian Sage with dignity can weep. <br /> See mitred Drummond heave the heartfelt groan, <br /> Where the cold ashes of his daughter sleep; <br /> Here sleep what once was beauty, once was grace, <br /> Grace that expresst, in each benignant smile, <br /> *That dearest harmony of soul, &amp; face, <br /> When beauty glories to be virtue's foil.</p> 
            <p>Such was the Maid, that, in the noon of youth, <br /> In virgin innocence, in natures pride, <br /> Grac'd with each liberal art, &amp; crownd with truth, <br /> Sunk in her fathers fond embrace, &amp; died. <br /> He weeps. O venerate the holy tear! <br /> Faith sooths his sorrows, lightens all their load; <br /> Patient he spreads his child upon her bier, <br /> And humbly yeilds an Angel to his God.</p> 
            <p>* Or thus: </p> 
            <p>That sweetest Sympathy of soul &amp; face, <br /> When beauty only blooms as virtue's foil.</p>
