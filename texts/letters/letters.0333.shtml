         <div class="salute">Dear Sir. </div>
      </div>
      <p>I sent an <span style="font-style:italic">impatient</span> letter to you (to use Mrs. Mincings Epithet to dinner) at Stoke, &amp; the day after
         it went, recd yours from London, with its accompanyment of Criticisms; for wch a thank
         severally, &amp; ten a peice for evry emendation, that is to say evry alteration. Yet
         I can't help thinking that if you had not seen the joint critique from Prior park,
         you would not have judgd so hardly of some of my new lines. True, I did not think
         evry thing that all my Criticks have remarkd necessary to be alterd, yet I alterd
         them for this reason, Criticks like Indians are proud of the number of scalps they
         make in a Manuscript, &amp; if you dont let them scalp theyll do you no service. However
         it appears I have Scalp'd myself in some places particularly at the beginning. Yet
         I cannot help thinking that <span style="font-style:italic">chills the pale plain beneath him</span> is an improvement, yet I can unscalp if you bid me. there is one unfortunate thing
         wch attends shewing either a markd or an alterd Manuscript, &amp; you yourself prove it
         to me; The person that reads it regards only the marks &amp; alterations &amp; considers whether
         they are right or wrong, &amp; hence a number of faulty Passages in the gross escape his
         observation. I remember I shewd Caract: this summer to a certain Critick who read
         it all over, &amp; returnd it me with this single Observation, "I have read it &amp; I think
         those faults wch are markd with a pencil ought to be alterd." I was surprizd at this
         because I did not know the Ms was markd at all at that time. I examind it &amp; found
         here &amp; there about 7 or eight almost invisible little X X. I could not conceive who
         had done it; I askd Delap if he had, &amp; he cryd peccavi, assuring me he only did it
         to remember to tell me of some minutiæ wch he thought inaccurate, but that he thought
         he had almost made them invisible. so quicksighted is the Eye of a Critic!
      </p>
      <p>But to proceed – I agree to allmost all your Criticisms; however they make against
         me, your absolution from Madors song makes amends for all. Yet I am sorry about the
         scene between Evelina &amp; Elidurus tis what the generality will think the principal
         scene, &amp; wch yet is not as it should be. I am afraid of making it more pathetic &amp;
         yet if it is not so it will not satisfy. I send you with this my third Ode you will
         find it must be inserted soon after the discription of the Rocking Stone, &amp; the last
         line of the sheet I send you will connect with this 
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>So certain that in our absolving tongues.</p>
      </div>
      <p> So that a few lines must be cancelld in the copy you have. my reason for this change
         is that <span style="font-style:italic">I myself I</span> thought (&amp; no body else) that a Lustration Ode would take up too much time in the
         place first intended &amp; that the action went on too slow there. I shall therefore shew
         more of Caractacus himself in the scene subsequent to the next I shall send you; &amp;
         I am pretty sure that (toute ensembles considerd) this will be an improvement. As
         to this Ode, I do not expect you to like it so well as you do the 2d, yet I hope 'tis
         well enough, &amp; will have some effect in the place it comes in. Explicit pars Poesi<span style="font-style:italic">ω</span>s &amp; incipit Pars Chitchatices. I dare not face Rutherforth that saintly Butcher in
         his purple Robes of Divinity, &amp; therefore, sorely against good Mr Brown's Gizzard,
         I have given up my fellowship &amp; this post carries my civilities to Dr Long concerning
         this great resignation. Indeed if I could dispute Black into white like my Uncle Balguy
         this act would have fallen out too unluckily for me to have thought of keeping it,
         for I am resolvd not to set my face southward these several Months, not evn if I publish
         this spring. For Ill either have the sheets sent down to me, or get somebody in town
         to correct the press, do you think either Dr Wharton or Stonehewer could be prevaild
         on to take this trouble. You are perpetually twitting me about my motive of Gain,
         could I write half as well as Rousseau I would prove to you that this is the only
         motive any reasonable Man should have in this matter, but pray distinguish the matter
         I mean Gain is not my only motive for writing, God forbid it should; I write for Fame,
         for Posterity, &amp; all sort of fine things. But Gain is my only motive for Publishing
         for I publish to the present Age, whom I would fleece if I could like any Cossack
         Calmuck or Carcolspack. Now do you understand me, &amp; if you do, don't you agree with
         me?
      </p>
      <p>This resuscitation of Poor Smart pains me, I was in hopes he was safe in that state
         where the best of us will be better than we are &amp; the worst I hope as little worse
         as infinite Justice can permit. But is he returnd to his senses? if so I fear that
         will be more terrible still, pray, if you can dispose of a Guinea so as it will in
         any sort benefit him (for tis too late for a ticket) give it for me. My best regard
         to Dr Wharton and Mrs if this finds you there.
      </p>
      <p>You will find from my last letter that Hurd is disposd to gratify the Drs Humanity.
         Have you seen Jortins Life of Erasmus? Was there ever such a lumbering Slovenly Book?
         I shant send a pacquet till I hear again from you, dont be long first.
