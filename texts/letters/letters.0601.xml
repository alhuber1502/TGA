         <p>I am return'd, my dear B., from the little journey I had made into Suffolk without answering the
					end proposed. The thought, that you might have been with me there, has embitter'd all my hours. Your letter has made me happy; as happy
					as so gloomy, so solitary a Being as I am is capable of being. I know and have too often felt the disadvantages I lay myself under, how
					much I hurt the little interest I have in you, by this air of sadness so contrary to your nature and present enjoyments: but sure you
					will forgive, tho' you can not sympathize with me. It is impossible with me to dissemble with you. Such as I am, I expose my heart to
					your view, nor wish to conceal a single thought from your penetrating eyes.â&#x80;&#x93;All that you say to me, especially on the subject of
					Switzerland, is infinitely acceptable. It feels too pleasing ever to be fulfill'd, and as often as I read over your truly kind letter,
					written long since from London, I stop at these words: <hi rend="italic">La mort qui peut glacer nos bras avant qu'ils soient
						entrelacÃ©s.</hi>
