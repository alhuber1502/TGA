      <p>All, alas! is over, and I have been compelled by cruel necessity to figure to myself
         all the splendours and glories; how the Ode was sung, and played, and applauded (all
         but) as it deserves (the first glimpse I shall see of it will be I suppose in the
         critical review ). How thoroughly sensible of the honour the duke was. How he was
         pressed to death by people who never saw a duke before; and thought themselves in
         heaven if a chance word dropped on them in the crowd. How Dr. Gordon clapped with
         both his hands, and grinned with all his teeth when his Grace but looked as if he
         would speak, and bowed lower than even clergymen are used to bow. I should have been
         glad to have heard the Ode, and very glad to have seen you; but I suspect that I shall
         like it as well without Dr. Randal's music. And as for you, you would have been so
         beset with ministers of state that I should have seen nothing of you; so I thought
         it best to remain in quiet here, rather than to put myself to a great deal of inconvenience,
         expense, and trouble, to get into the midst of a bustle which I hate, and be disappointed
         at last.

      <p>We shall depart, I suppose, the middle of this month, so, if after that time you direct
         to me at Augustus Floyer's, Esq. at Upwey, near Dorchester, Dorsetshire, I shall be
         very glad to hear news from Yorkshire, or Cumberland, or Westmoreland, or no news
         at all provided I hear.
      </p>
      <p>Many thanks for the Wilton book!</p>
      <p>I have read the first volume of Robertson. It may be all vastly right, but it certainly
         is a little tiresome to have five hundred pages of disquisitions on feudal tenures,
         &amp;c. such a pile of gothic learning in your way, when you are all impatience to begin
         an interesting history; and surely, it is not good policy in the author to tire you
         to death in order to interest you the more. All that I know is, that it is not at
         all like MÃ©moires de Sully. But then Robertson is a grave historian, and the other
         only a writer of memoirs. Why then a writer of memoirs is a better thing than an historian.

      <p>And so my mother waits to carry my letter to the post, and desires her compliments.

      <p>I am at the moment <span style="font-style:italic">inebriated</span> with gales of mignonette of my own sowing. 'Oh the pleasures of the plain', &amp;c. For
         God's sake leave Pembroke (at least when there are leaves on the trees) and get a
         house in Wales, and let me come and pass a summer with you. Adieu! do not despise
         me when you come among the mountains.
