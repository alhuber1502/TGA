         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>Do not think me very dilatory, for I have been sending away all my things from this
         house (where nevertheless I shall continue while I stay in Town) &amp; have besides been
         confined with a severe cold to my room. on rummageing Mr Bromwich's &amp; several other
         shops I am forced to tell you, that there are absolutely no papers at all, that deserve
         the name of Gothick, or that you would bear the sight of. they are all what they call
         <span style="font-style:italic">fancy,</span> &amp; indeed resemble nothing that ever was in use in any age or country. I am going
         to advise, what perhaps you may be deter'd from by the addition of expence, but what,
         in your case I should certainly do. any body that can draw the least in the world
         is capable of sketching in Indian ink a compartment or two of diaper-work, or a nich
         or tabernacle with its fretwork: take such a Man with you to Durham-Cathedral, &amp; let
         him copy one division of any ornament you think will have any effect, from the high-altar
         suppose or the nine altars, or what you please. if nothing there suits you, chuse
         in Dart's Canterbury or Dugdale's Warwickshire, &amp;c: &amp; send the design hither. they
         will execute it here, &amp; make a new stamp on purpose, provided you will take 20 pieces
         of it, &amp; it will come to 1/2 or a penny a yard the more (according to the work, that
         is in it). this I really think worth your while. I mention your doing it there, because
         it will be then under your own eye, &amp; at your own choice, &amp; you can proportion the
         whole better to the dimensions of your room, for if the design be of arcade work,
         or any thing on a pretty large scale, &amp; the arches or niches are to rise one above
         the other, there must be some contrivance, that they may fill the entire space &amp; not
         be cut in sunder and incompleat .. this indeed, where the work is in small compartments,
         is not to be minded. say therefore, if you come into this; or shall I take a Man here
         to Westminster, &amp; let him copy some of those fretworks? tho' I think, in the books
         I have named you may find better things. I much doubt of the effect colours (any other
         than the tints of stucco) would have in a gothic design on paper, &amp; here they have
         nothing to judge from. those I spoke of at Ely were green &amp; pale blue with the raised
         work white, if you care to hazard it. I saw an all-silver paper quite plain, &amp; it
         look'd like block-tin. in short there is nothing I would venture to send you. One
         of 3D a yard in small compartments thus, might perhaps do for the stairs, but very
         likely it is common, &amp; besides it is not pure gothick, therefore I would not send
         it alone. Adieu &amp; tell me soon what I shall do.
