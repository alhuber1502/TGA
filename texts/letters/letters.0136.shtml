      <p>I have expected some time what You tell me. if T: can be prevail'd upon to stay away
         it is all I desire: for he is mistaken in imagineing that will leave still an Equality
         among the Fellows. it is all an idle Tale the Master for his own Interest would propagate
         about the Party of his Antagonists. whatever some of the People who give us their
         Vote may have been I may confidently affirm no one so young as my Friend can be more
         rationally  &amp; zealously well-affected to the Government than he. the Hurry I write
         in does not permit to return you the Thanks I ought for your stedfastness &amp; resolution
         in obligeing me.
      </p>
