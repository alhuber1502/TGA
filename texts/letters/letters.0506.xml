            <salute>Dear Mr Gray </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>In hopes this may catch you before you set off for Hartlepool I answer yours the moment I receive it (Minster Vespers only
					intervening) The Dean has disapointed me &amp; is not yet arrivd, the Robinsons I expect every hour. in the meanwhile I will resume the subject of the Epitaph.</p>
         <p>Had you given me any hint any <hi rend="italic">Lueur</hi> how the three first lines might have been alterd, it would have been
					charitable indeed. But you say nothing, only that I must alter them, Now in my Conscience to wch you appeal I cannot find fault with
					the Sentiment wch they contain, &amp; yet in dispite of my Conscience if I thought that they implyd the least shadow of flattery to the
					ABp I would wipe them out with a spunge dipt in the mud of the kennel. But I cannot think they do. I think on the contrary they give
					the Composition that Unity of Thought wch ought always to run thro compositions of this kind, for in my mind <hi rend="italic">a
						Perfect Epitaph is a Perfect Epigram without a sting.</hi> NB this sentence in our Epistol√¶ Familiares cum notis variorum will be
					explaind, in a Note of Dr Balguys, to the contentation of every reader; in the meantime if you dont understand it yourself, console
					yourself with the pleasing Idea that Posterity will, &amp; that is enough in reason.</p>
         <p>However to shew you my Complacency, &amp; in dread that you should ever do as you threaten, &amp; call whatever I send you the most
					perfect things in Nature, I will sacrifice the first Stanza on Your Critical Altar. &amp; let it consume either in flame or <hi rend="italic">Smudge</hi> as it chuses. Then we begin, <hi rend="italic">Here sleeps</hi> a very poetical sort of <hi rend="italic">Ci
						git,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">here lies,</hi> &amp; wch I hope will not lead the reader to imagine a sentence lost.</p>
         <q>
            <p>1 Here sleeps what once was Beauty once was Grace<lb/> 2 Grace that with native Sentiment combind<lb/> 3 To form that Harmony of
						Soul &amp; face<lb/> 4 Where Beauty shines the mirror of the mind<lb/> 5 Such was the Maid that in the noon of youth,<lb/> 6 In
						Virgin innocence in natures pride<lb/> 7 Blest with each Art that taste supplies or Truth<lb/> 8 Sunk in her Fathers fond embrace
						&amp; died<lb/> 9 He weeps O venerate the holy tear<lb/> 10 Faith lends her aid to ease afflictions Load<lb/> 11 The Parent mourns
						his child upon her bier<lb/> 12 The Christian yeilds an Angel to his God.
					</p>
         </q>
         <p>Various Lections, pick, &amp; chuse, <lb/> 2 <hi rend="italic">inborn</hi> sentiment.<lb/> 3 <hi rend="italic">displayd</hi> or <hi rend="italic">diffusd</hi> that Harmony &amp;c.<lb/> 7 that <hi rend="italic">springs</hi> from taste or Truth <hi rend="italic">derivd</hi> from taste or Truth, that <hi rend="italic">charms</hi> with taste &amp; Truth. But, after all I dont know that she was a
					Metaphysician Blest with each art <hi rend="italic">that owes its charms</hi> to Truth wch Painting does as well as Logic &amp;
					Metaphysics.<lb/> 10 Faith lends her lenient aid to Sorrows Load. Faith lends her Aid &amp; <hi rend="italic">eases</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lightens</hi> Sorrows Load<lb/> 11 Pensive he <hi rend="italic">mourns</hi> or he <hi rend="italic">views</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gives</hi>
            <lb/> 12 <hi rend="italic">Yet humbly yeilds</hi> or <hi rend="italic">But</hi> humbly</p>
         <p>Now if from all this you can pick out 12 Ostensible Lines, do, &amp; Ill father them, or if you will out of that Lukewarm corner of
					your heart where you hoard up your poetical Charity, throw out a poor mite to my distresses, I shall take it kind indeed. But if not,
					Stat prior Sententia, for I will give myself no further trouble about it. I cannot in this uncomfortable place where my Opus Magnum
					sive didacticum has not advancd ten lines since I saw you.</p>
         <p>God bless Dr Wharton &amp; send him (for his Sympathy) never to feel what I feel. I will come to him the moment I can; write be sure
					you [do] when you return from your longer tour. But I hope to have an answer to this before you set out, because I shall not give the
					ABp any detirminate answer about the matter till I hear again from you. The Robinsons are just arrivd. </p>

            <p>I must needs tell you, as an instance of my enjoyments here that Yesterday Mr Comber preachd again
						&amp; dind with me &amp; in the afternoon who but Billy Harvey should preach &amp; drink tea with me!
						The said Billy enquird most Cordially after you &amp; has got your directions how to come at you, by Kirksomething &amp; Spinny moor house, for he is going into Scotland with a Scotch Captain, ten times duller than
						himself. youll have them at Old park almost as soon as this if you dont run away. </p>

            <p>The Country Folks are firmly persuaded that the Storm (wch made us get up here) was raisd by the Devil out of revenge to Comber for
						preaching <hi rend="italic">at him</hi> the day before in the minster.</p>
