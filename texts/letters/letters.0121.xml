         <p> I should not have fail'd to answer your Letter immediately, but I went out of town for a little while, wch hinder'd me. its length
					(beside the Pleasure naturally accompanying a long letter from you) affords me a new one, when I think it is a kind of Symptom of the
					Recovery of your Health, &amp; flatter myself that your bodily Strength returns in proportion. pray do not forget to mention the
					Progress you make continually. as to Agrippina, I begin to be of your opinion, &amp; find myself (as Women are of their children) less
					enamour'd of my Productions the older they grow. she is laid up to sleep, till next Summer: so bid her
					Good night. I think you have translated Tacitus very justly, that is freely, &amp; accommodated his thoughts to the Turn &amp; Genius
					of our Language. which at the same time I commend your Judgement, is no commendation of the English tongue, which is too diffuse, &amp;
					daily grows more &amp; more enervate, &amp; one shall never be more sensible of this, than in turning an Author like Tacitus. I have
					been trying it in some parts of Thucydides (who has a little resemblance of him in his Conciseness) &amp; endeavour'd to do it closely,
					but found it produced mere Nonsense. if you have any inclination to see what figure he makes in Italian, I have a Tuscan translation of
						Davanzati, much-esteem'd in Italy; &amp; will send you the same Speech you sent me: that is, if you
					care for it. in the mean time accept of Propertius.</p>

            <p>LIB: 2: ELEG: 1: </p>
            <p>To MecÃ¦nas </p>
            <p>You ask, why thus my Loves I still rehearse? <lb/> Whence the soft Strain &amp; ever-melting Verse? <lb/> From Cynthia all, that
						in my Numbers shines; <lb/> She is my Genius, she inspires the Lines, <lb/> No PhÅ&#x93;bus else, no other Muse I know: <lb/> She tunes
						my easy Rhime, &amp; gives the Lay to flow. <lb/> If the loose Curls around her Forehead play, <lb/> Or lawless o'er their Ivory
						Margin stray: <lb/> If the thin Coan Web her Shape reveal, <lb/> And half disclose the Limbs it should conceal. <lb/> Of those
						loose Curls, that ivory Front I write; <lb/> Of the dear Web whole Volumes I indite: <lb/> Or if to Musick she the Lyre awake,
						<lb/> That the soft Subject of my Song I make; <lb/> And sing, with what a careless Grace she flings <lb/> Her artful Hand across
						the sounding Strings. <lb/> If sinking into Sleep she seem to close <lb/> Her languid Lids, I favour her Repose <lb/> With lulling
						Notes, &amp; thousand Beauties see, <lb/> That Slumber brings to aid my Poetry. <lb/> When less averse, &amp; yielding to Desires
						<lb/> She half accepts, &amp; half rejects my Fires: <lb/> While to retain the envious Lawn she tries, <lb/> And struggles to elude
						my longing Eyes: <lb/> The fruitful Muse from that auspicious Night <lb/> Dates the long Iliad of the amorous Fight. <lb/> In brief
						whate'er she do, or say, or look <lb/> 'Tis ample Matter for a Lover's Book <lb/> And many a copious Narrative you'll see, <lb/>
						Big with th' important Nothing's History. </p>
            <p>Yet would the Tyrant Love permit me raise <lb/> My feeble Voice to sing the Victor's Praise, <lb/> To paint the Hero's Toil, the
						Ranks of War, <lb/> The laurel'd Triumph, &amp; the sculptured Car: <lb/> No Giant-Race, no Tumult of the Skies, <lb/> No
						Mountain-Structure in my Verse should rise; <lb/> No Tale of Thebes, or Ilium there should be, <lb/> Nor how the Persian trod th'
						indignant Sea, <lb/> Nor Marius' Cimbrian Wreaths would I relate, <lb/> Nor lofty Carthage struggleing with her Fate: <lb/> Here
						should Augustus great in Arms appear, <lb/> And thou, MecÃ¦nas, be my second Care: <lb/> Here Mutina from Flames &amp; Famine free
						<lb/> And there th' ensanguin'd Wave of Sicily, <lb/> And sceptred Alexandria's captive Shore, <lb/> And sad Philippi red with
						Roman Gore. <lb/> Then, while the vaulted Skies loud Io's rend, <lb/> In golden Chains should loaded Monarchs bend; <lb/> And hoary
						Nile with pensive Aspect seem <lb/> To mourn the Glories of his sevenfold Stream: <lb/> The long-contended World's old Discords
						cease, <lb/> And Actium's Terrours grace the Pomp of Peace; <lb/> While Beaks, that late in fierce Encounter met, <lb/> Move thro'
						the sacred Way, &amp; vainly threat. <lb/> Thee too the Muse should consecrate to Fame,<lb/> And
						with his Garlands weave thy ever-faithful Name. <lb/> But nor Callimachus' enervate Strain <lb/> May tell of Jove, &amp; Phlegra's
						blasted Plain; <lb/> Nor I with unaccustom'd Vigour trace <lb/> Back to its Source divine the Julian Race. <lb/> Sailors to tell of
						Seas &amp; Winds delight, <lb/> The Shepherd of his Flocks, the Soldier of the Fight, <lb/> A milder Warfare I in verse display,
						<lb/> Each in his proper Art should wast the Day: <lb/> Nor thou my gentle Calling disapprove, <lb/> To die is glorious in the Bed
						of Love. <lb/> Happy the Youth, &amp; not unknown to Fame, <lb/> Whose heart has never felt a second Flame. <lb/> Oh, might that
						envied Happiness be mine, <lb/> To Cynthia all my Wishes I confine <lb/> Or if, alas! it be my fate to try <lb/> Another Love, the
						quicker let me die.<lb/> But she, the Mistress of my Faithful Breast, <lb/> Has oft the Charms of
						Constancy confest, <lb/> Condemns her fickle Sex'es fond Mistake, <lb/> And hates the Tale of Troy for Helen's Sake. <lb/> Me from
						myself the soft Enchantress stole, <lb/> Ah, let her ever my Desires controul, <lb/> Or if I fall, the Victim of her Scorn, <lb/>
						From her loved Doors may my pale Coarse be born. <lb/> The Power of Herbs can other Harms remove, <lb/> And find a Cure for every
						Ill, but Love. <lb/> The Lemnian's Hurt Machaon could repair, <lb/> Heal the slow Chief, &amp; send again to War. <lb/> To Chiron
						PhÅ&#x93;nix owed his long-lost Sight, <lb/> And PhÅ&#x93;bus' Son restored Androgeon to the Light. <lb/> Here Skill is vain, even Magick here
						must fail, <lb/> The powerful Mixture, &amp; the Midnight Spell. <lb/> The Hand, that can my captive Heart release, <lb/> And to
						this Bosom give its wonted Peace, <lb/> May the long Thirst of Tantalus allay, <lb/> And drive th' infernal Vulture from his Prey.
						<lb/> For Ills unseen what remedy is found, <lb/> Or who can probe the undiscover'd Wound? <lb/> The Bed avails not, or the
						Leeche's care, <lb/> Nor changeing Skies can hurt, nor sultry Air, <lb/> 'Tis hard th' elusive Symptoms to explore, <lb/> Today the
						Lover walks, tomorrow is no more: <lb/> A Train of mourning Friends attend his Pall, <lb/> And wonder at the sudden Funeral. <lb/>
						When then my Fates, that breath they gave, shall claim, <lb/> When the short Marble shall preserve a Name, <lb/> A little Verse, my
						All that shall remain; <lb/> Thy passing Courser's slacken'd Speed detain, <lb/> (Thou envied Honour of thy Poet's Days, <lb/> Of
						all our Youth th' Ambition &amp; the Praise!) <lb/> Then to my quiet Urn awhile draw near, <lb/> And say, (while o'er the place you
						drop a Tear) <lb/> Love &amp; the Fair were of his Life the Pride, <lb/> He lived, while She was kind, &amp; when she frown'd, he
						died. </p>
