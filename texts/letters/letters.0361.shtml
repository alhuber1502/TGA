         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>I heard yesterday from your old Friend Mr. Field, that Mrs Wharton had brought you
         a Son, &amp; as I sincerely hope this may be some addition to your happiness, I heartily
         congratulate you both on the occasion. another thing I rejoice in is, to know, that
         you not only grow reconciled to your scene, but discover beauties round you, that
         once were deformities. I am persuaded the whole matter is to have always something
         going forward. happy they, that can create a rose-tree, or erect a honey-suckle, that
         can watch the brood of a Hen, or see a fleet of their own ducklings launch into the
         water! it is with a sentiment of envy I speak it, who never shall have even a thatch'd
         roof of my own, nor gather a strawberry but in Covent-Garden. I will not believe in
         the <span style="font-style:italic">vocality</span> of Old-Park till next summer, when perhaps I may trust my own ears.
      </p>
      <p>I remain (bating some few little excursions, that I have made) still in Town, tho'
         for these three weeks I have been going into Oxfordshire with Madam Speed; but her
         affairs, as she says, or her vagaries, as I say, have obliged her to alter her mind
         ten times within that space: no wonder, for she has got at least 30,000£ with a house
         in Town, plate, jewels, china, &amp; old-japan infinite, so that indeed it would be ridiculous
         for her to know her own mind. I, who know mine, do intend to go to Cambridge, but
         that Owl Fobus is going thither to the Commencement, so that I am forced to stay till
         his Nonsense is at an end. Chapman you see is dead at last, wch signifies not much,
         I take it, to any body, for his family (they say) are left in good circumstances.
         I am neither sorry, nor glad, for M: (I doubt) will scarce succeed to his Prebend.
         the old Creature is down at Aston, where my Lord has paid him a visit lately, as the
         Town says, in <span style="font-style:italic">a Miff,</span>  about the garter, &amp; other <span style="font-style:italic">Frumps,</span> he has met with of late. I believe, this at least is certain, that he has deserted
         his old attachments, &amp; worships another Idol, who receives his incense with a good
         deal of coldness &amp; negligence.
      </p>
      <p>I can tell you but little of St Germain. he saw Mons:r D'Affry at the Hague, who in
         a day or two (on receiving a Courier from his own Court) ask'd the State's leave to
         apprehend him, but he was gone, &amp; arrived safe in St Mary-Ax, where he had lodgings
         (I fancy) at his old Friend La-Cour's, the Jew-Physician. after some days a Messenger
         took charge of him, &amp; he was examined (I believe), before Mr Pitt. they however dismissed
         him, but with orders to leave England directly, yet I know care was taken, that he
         should be furnish'd with proper passports to go safe thro' Holland to Hamb'rough:
         wch gives some room to believe, what many at first imagined, that he was charged with
         some proposal from the French Court. he is a likely Person enough to make them believe
         at Paris, that he could somehow serve them on such an occasion.
      </p>
      <p>We are in great alarms about Quebec. the force in the Town was not 3000 Men, sufficient
         to defend the place (naturally strong) against any attack of the French forces, unfurnish'd
         as they must be for a formal siege: but by no means to meet them in the field. this
         however is what Murray has chose to do, whether from rashness, or deceived by false
         intelligence, I can not tell. the returns of our loss are undoubtedly false, for we
         have above 100 Officers kill'd or taken. all depends upon the arrival of our Garrison
         from Louïsbourg, wch was daily expected, but even that (unless they bring provisions
         with them) may increase the distress, for at the time, when we were told of the plenty
         &amp; cheapness of all things at Quebec, I am assured, a piece of fresh meat could not
         be had for 20 Guineas.
      </p>
      <p>If you have seen Stonhewer he has probably told you of my old Scotch (or rather Irish)
         Poetry. I am gone mad about them. they are said to be translations (literal &amp; in prose)
         from the <span style="font-style:italic">Erse</span>-tongue, done by one Macpherson, a young Clergyman in the High-lands. he means to
         publish a Collection he has of these Specimens of antiquity, if it be antiquity: but
         what plagues me is, I can not come at any certainty on that head. I was so struck,
         so <span style="font-style:italic">extasié</span> with their infinite beauty, that I writ into Scotland to make a thousand enquiries.
         the letters I have in return are ill-wrote, ill-reason'd, unsatisfactory, calculated
         (one would imagine) to deceive one, &amp; yet not cunning enough to do it cleverly. in
         short, the whole external evidence would make one believe these fragments (for so
         he calls them, tho' nothing can be more entire) counterfeit: but the internal is so
         strong on the other side, that I am resolved to believe them genuine, spite of the
         Devil &amp; the Kirk. it is impossible to convince me, that they were invented by the
         same Man, that writes me these letters. on the other hand it is almost as hard to
         suppose, if they are original, that he should be able to translate them so admirably.
         what can one do? since St:r went, I have received another of a very different &amp; inferior
         kind (being merely descriptive) much more modern than the former (he says) yet very
         old too; this too in it's way is extremely fine. in short this Man is the very Demon
         of Poetry, or he has lighted on a treasure hid for ages. the Welch Poets are also
         coming to light: I have seen a Discourse in Mss. about them (by one Mr Evans, a Clergyman)
         with specimens of their writings. this is in Latin, &amp;, tho' it don't approach the
         other, there are fine scraps among it.
      </p>
      <p>You will think I am grown mighty poetical of a sudden; you would think so still more,
         if you knew, there was a Satyr printed against me &amp; Mason jointly. it is call'd <span style="font-style:italic">Two Odes:</span> the one is inscribed to Obscurity (that is me) the other to Oblivion. it tells me
         what I never heard before, for (speaking of himself) the Author says, tho' he has
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>Nor the Pride, nor Self-Opinion, <br /> That possess the happy Pair, <br /> Each of Taste the fav'rite Minion, <br /> Prancing thro' the desert air: <br /> Yet shall he mount, with classick housings graced, <br /> By help mechanick of equestrian block; <br /> And all unheedful of the Critick's mock <br /> Spur his light Courser o'er the bounds of Taste.
         </p>
      </div>
      <p>The writer is a Mr Coleman, who publish'd the <span style="font-style:italic">Connoisseur,</span> nephew to the late Lady Bath, &amp; a Friend of Garrick's. I believe his Odes sell no
         more than mine did, for I saw a heap of them lie in a Bookseller's window, who recommended
         them to me as a very pretty thing.
      </p>
      <p>If I did not mention Tristram to you, it was because I thought I had done so before.
         there is much good fun in it, &amp; humour sometimes hit &amp; sometimes mist. I agree with
         your opinion of it, &amp; shall see the two future volumes with pleasure. have you read
         his Sermons (with his own comic figure at the head of them)? they are in the style
         I think most proper for the Pulpit, &amp; shew a very strong imagination &amp; a sensible
         heart: but you see him often tottering on the verge of laughter, &amp; ready to throw
         his perriwig in the face of his audience. now for my season.
