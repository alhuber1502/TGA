					       <dateline>Amiens, April 1, N.S. 1739. </dateline>
				     </opener>
				     <p>As we made but a very short journey to-day, and came to our inn early, I sit down to give you some account of our expedition. On the
					29th (according to the style here) we left Dover at twelve at noon, and with a pretty brisk gale,
					which pleased everybody mighty well, except myself who was extremely sick the whole time; we reached Calais by five: The weather
					changed, and it began to snow hard the minute we came into the harbour, where we took the boat, and soon landed. Calais is an exceeding
					old, but very pretty town, and we hardly saw any thing there that was not so new and so different from England, that it surprized us
					agreeably. We went the next morning to the great Church, and were at high Mass (it being Easter Monday). We saw also the Convent of the
					Capuchins, and the Nuns of St. Dominic; with these last we held much conversation, especially with an English Nun, a Mrs. Davis, of
					whose work I sent you, by the return of the Pacquet, a letter-case to remember her by. In the afternoon we took a Post-chaise (it still
					snowing very hard) for Boulogne, which was only eighteen miles further. This chaise is a strange sort of conveyance, of much greater
					use than beauty, resembling an ill-shaped chariot, only with the door opening before instead of the side; three horses draw it, one
					between the shafts, and the other two on each side, on one of which the postillion rides, and drives too: This vehicle will, upon occasion, go fourscore miles a-day, but Mr. Walpole, being in no hurry, chooses to make easy journeys of
					it, and they are easy ones indeed; for the motion is much like that of a sedan, we go about six miles an hour, and commonly change
					horses at the end of it: It is true they are no very graceful steeds, but they go well, and through roads which they say are bad for
					France, but to me they seem gravel walks and bowling-greens; in short it would be the finest travelling in the world, were it not for
					the inns, which are mostly terrible places indeed. But to describe our progress somewhat more regularly, we came into Boulogne when it
					was almost dark, and went out pretty early on Tuesday morning; so that all I can say about it is, that it is a large, old, fortified
					town, with more English in it than French. On Tuesday we were to go to Abbéville, seventeen leagues, or fifty-one short English miles;
					but by the way we dined at Montreuil, much to our hearts' content, on stinking mutton cutlets, addle eggs, and ditch water. Madame the
					hostess made her appearance in long lappets of bone lace and a sack of linsey-woolsey. We supped and lodged pretty well at Abbéville,
					and had time to see a little of it before we came out this morning. There are seventeen convents in it, out of which we saw the chapels
					of the Minims and the Carmelite Nuns. We are now come further thirty miles to Amiens, the chief city of the province of Picardy. We
					have seen the cathedral, which is just what that of Canterbury must have been before the reformation. It is about the same size, a huge
					Gothic building, beset on the outside with thousands of small statues, and within adorned with beautiful painted windows, and a vast
					number of chapels dressed out in all their finery of altar-pieces, embroidery, gilding, and marble. Over the high altar is preserved,
					in a very large wrought shrine of massy gold, the reliques of St. Firmin, their patron saint. We went also to the chapels of the
					Jesuits and Ursuline Nuns, the latter of which is very richly adorned. To-morrow we shall lie at Clermont, and next day reach Paris.
					The country we have passed through hitherto has been flat, open, but agreeably diversified with villages, fields well-cultivated, and
					little rivers. On every hillock is a wind-mill, a crucifix, or a Virgin Mary dressed in Flowers, and a sarcenet robe; one sees
						[not] many people or carriages on the road; now and then indeed you meet a strolling friar, a
					country-man with his great muff, or a woman riding astride on a little ass, with short petticoats, and a great head-dress of blue wool.
