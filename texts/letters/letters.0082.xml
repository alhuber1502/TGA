         <p>In my last I gave you the particulars of our little journey to Geneva: I have only to add, that we stayed about a week, in order to
					see Mr. Conway settled there: I do not wonder so many English choose it for their residence; the city is very small, neat, prettily
					built, and extremely populous; the Rhône runs through the middle of it, and it is surrounded with new fortifications, that give it a
					military compact air; which, joined to the happy, lively countenances of the inhabitants, and an exact discipline always as strictly
					observed as in time of war, makes the little republic appear a match for a much greater power; though perhaps Geneva, and all that
					belongs to it, are not of equal extent with Windsor and its two parks. To one that has passed through Savoy, as we did, nothing can be
					more striking than the contrast, as soon as he approaches the town. Near the gates of Geneva runs the torrent Arve, which separates it
					from the King of Sardinia's dominions; on the other side of it lies a country naturally, indeed, fine and fertile; but you meet with
					nothing in it but meager, ragged, bare-footed peasants, with their children, in extreme misery and nastiness; and even of these no
					great numbers: You no sooner have crossed the stream I have mentioned, but poverty is no more; not a beggar, hardly a discontented face
					to be seen; numerous, and well-dressed people swarming on the ramparts; drums beating, soldiers, well cloathed and armed, exercising;
					and folks, with business in their looks, hurrying to and fro; all contribute to make any person, who is not blind, sensible what a
					difference there is between the two governments, that are the causes of one view and the other. The beautiful lake, at one end of which
					the town is situated; its extent; the several states that border upon it; and all its pleasures, are too well known for me to mention
					them. We sailed upon it as far as the dominions of Geneva extend, that is, about two leagues and a half on each side; and landed at
					several of the little houses of pleasure, that the inhabitants have built all about it, who received us with much politeness. The same
					night we eat part of a trout, taken in the lake, that weighed thirty-seven pounds; as great a monster as it appeared to us, it was
					esteemed there nothing extraordinary, and they assured us, it was not uncommon to catch them of fifty pounds; they are dressed here,
					and sent post to Paris upon some great occasions; nay, even to Madrid, as we were told. The road we returned through was not the same
					we came by: We crossed the Rhône at Seyssel, and passed for three days among the mountains of Bugey, without meeting with any thing
					new: At last we came out into the plains of La Bresse, and so to Lyons again. Sir Robert has written to Mr. Walpole, to desire he would
					go to Italy; which he has resolved to do; so that all the scheme of spending the winter in the South of France is laid aside, and we
					are to pass it in a much finer country. You may imagine I am not sorry to have this opportunity of seeing the place in the world that
					best deserves it: Besides as the Pope (who is eighty-eight, and has been lately at the point of death)
					cannot probably last a great while, perhaps we may have the fortune to be present at the election of a new one, when Rome will be in
					all its glory. Friday next we certainly begin our journey; in two days we shall come to the foot of the Alps, and six more we shall be
					in passing them. Even here the winter is begun; what then must it be among those vast snowy mountains where it is hardly ever summer?
					We are, however, as well armed as possible against the cold, with muffs, hoods, and masks of bever, fur-boots, and bear skins. When we
					arrive at Turin, we shall rest after the fatigues of the journey. [...]</p>
