      </div>
      <p>I have been for these three weeks &amp; more confined to my room by a fit of the gout,
         &amp; am now only beginning to walk alone again. I should not mention the thing, but that
         I am well-persuaded, it will soon be your own case, as you have so soon laid aside
         your horse, &amp; talk so relishingly of your old Port. </p>
      <p>I can not see any objection to your design for Mr P:,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as to Wilson<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> we know him much alike. he seems a good honest Lad, &amp; (I believe) is scholar enough
         for your purpose.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> perhaps this connection may make (or marr) his fortune. our friend Foljambe<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has resided in college &amp; persevered in the ways of godliness till about ten days
         ago, when he disappear'd, &amp; no one knows, whether he is gone a hunting or a fornicating.
         the little Fitz-herbert<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is come a Pensioner to St John's, &amp; seems to have all his wits about him. your ElÃ©ve
         Ld Richard Cav:sh<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> having digested all the learning and all the beef this place could afford him in
         a two month's residence<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is about to leave us, &amp; his little Brother George<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> succeeds him. Bp Keene has brought a Son<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> from Eton to Peterhouse, &amp; Dr Heberden<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> another<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to St John's, who is enter'd Pensioner, &amp; destined to the Church. this is all my
         University-news, but why do I tell you? come yourself &amp; see, for I hope you remember
         your promise at Aston, &amp; will make us in your way, as you go to your town-residence.</p>
      <p>You have seen Stonh:r (I imagine) who went northwards on Saturday last. pray tell
         me how he is, for I think him not quite well. tell me this &amp; tell me when I may expect
         to see you here.</p>
