            <salute>My Dear Sr</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I found (as soon as I got hither) a very kind Letter from Mr Chute, from whence I have Reason to hope we may all meet in Town about a
					Week hence. You have probably been there, since I left you, &amp; consequently have seen the Mr Barry
					you desired some Account of: yet as I am not certain of this, &amp; should be glad to know whether we agree about him; I will
					nevertheless tell you what he is, &amp; the Impression he made upon me. he is upwards of six Foot in Height, well &amp; proportionably
					made, treads well, &amp; knows what to do with his Limbs; in short a noble graceful Figure: I can say nothing of his Face, but that it
					was all Black, with a wide Mouth &amp; good Eyes. his Voice is of a clear &amp; pleasing Tone, something like Delane's, but not so deep-mouth'd, not so like a Passing Bell. when high strained, it is apt to crack a little, &amp;
					be hoarse: but in its common Pitch, &amp; when it sinks into any softer Passion, particularly expressive &amp; touching. in the first
					Scenes, especially where he recounts to the Senate the Progress of his Love, &amp; the Means he used to win Desdemona, he was quite
					mistaken, &amp; I took a Pique against him: instead of a Cool Narration he flew into a Rant of Voice &amp; Action, as tho' he were
					relating the Circumstances of a Battle that was fought yesterday. I expected nothing more from him, but was deceived: in the Scenes of
					Rage &amp; Jealousy he was seldom inferior to Quin: in the Parts of Tenderness &amp; Sorrow far
					above him. these latter seem to be his peculiarly: his Action is not very various, but rarely improper, or without Dignity: &amp; some
					of his Attitudes are really fine. he is not perfect to be sure; but I think may make a better Player than any now on the Stage in a
					little while. however to see a Man in one Character, &amp; but once, is not sufficient: so I rather ask your Opinion by this, than give
					you mine.</p>
         <p>I annex (as you desired) another Ode. all it pretends to with you is, that it is mine, &amp; that
					you never saw it before, &amp; that it is not so long as t'other.</p>
         <q>
            <p>Lo, where the rosie-bosom'd Hours, <lb/> Fair Venus' Train, appear, <lb/> Disclose the long-expecting Flowers, <lb/> And wake the
						purple Year! <lb/> The Attic Warbler pours her Throat <lb/> Responsive to the Cuckow's Note, <lb/> The untaught Harmony of Spring:
						<lb/> While whisp'ring Pleasure as they fly <lb/> Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue Sky <lb/> Their gather'd Fragrance fling </p>
            <p>Where'er the Oak's thick Branches stretch <lb/> A broader browner Shade; <lb/> Where'er the rude &amp; moss-grown Beech <lb/>
						O'ercanopies the Glade; <note place="margin" n="*">–a Bank <lb/> Oercanopied with luscious Woodbine <lb/> Shakesp: <title>Mids: Night's
								Dream</title>
               </note>
               <lb/> Beside some Water's rushy Brink <lb/> With me the Muse shall sit, &amp; think
						<lb/> (At Ease reclined in rustic State) <lb/> How vain the Ardour of the Crowd, <lb/> How low, how indigent the Proud, <lb/> How
						little are the Great!
					</p>
            <p>Still is the toiling Hand of Care: <lb/> The panting Herds repose. <lb/> Yet hark, how thro' the peopled Air <lb/> The busy
						Murmur glows! <lb/> The Insect-Youth are on the Wing <lb/> Eager to tast the honied Spring, <lb/> And float amid the liquid Noon:
							<note place="margin" n="†">Nare per æstatem liquidam. Virg:</note>
               <lb/> Some lightly o'er the Current
						skim, <lb/> Some shew their gayly-gilded Trim <lb/> Quick-glanceing to the Sun. </p>
            <p>To Contemplation's sober Eye <lb/> Such is the Race of Man: <lb/> And they that creep, &amp; they that fly, <lb/> Shall end where
						they began. <lb/> Alike the Busy &amp; the Gay <lb/> But flutter thro' Life's little Day, <lb/> In Fortune's varying Colours drest:
						<lb/> Brush'd by the Hand of rough Mischance, <lb/> Or chill'd by Age, their airy Dance <lb/> They leave, in Dust to rest. </p>
            <p>Methinks I hear in Accents low <lb/> The sportive Kind reply, <lb/> Poor Moralist! &amp; what art Thou? <lb/> A solitary Fly!
						<lb/> Thy Joys no glittering Female meets, <lb/> No Hive hast thou of hoarded Sweets, <lb/> No painted Plumage to display: <lb/>
						On hasty Wings thy Youth is flown; <lb/> Thy Sun is set; thy Spring is gone: <lb/> We frolick, while 'tis May. </p>
         </q>
         <p>My Compliments to Ashton.</p>
