            <dateline>Saturday. Oct: Pemb: Coll:</dateline>
            <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I rejoice. but has she common sense, is she a Gentlewoman? has she money? has she a nose? I know,
					she sings a little, &amp; twiddles on the harpsichord, hammers at sentiment, &amp; puts herself in an attitude, admires a cast in the
						eye, &amp; can say Elfrida by heart: but these are only the virtues of a Maid. do, let her have some
					wifelike qualities, &amp; a double portion of prudence, as she will have not only herself to govern, but you also, &amp; that with an
					absolute sway. your Friends, I doubt not, will suffer for it: however we are very happy, &amp; have no other wish than to see you
					settled in the world. we beg you would not stand fiddleing about it, but be married forthwith, &amp; then take chaise, and come
					consummating all the way to Cambridge to be touch'd by Mr Brown, &amp; so to London, where to be sure
					she must pass the first winter. if good reasons (&amp; not your own, nor her Coquetry) forbid this: yet come hither yourself, for our
						Copuses and Welch Rabbets are impatient for you.</p>
         <p>
					 I have compared Helvetius &amp; Elfrida, and find thirteen parallel passages, five of which at least
					are so direct &amp; close, as to leave no shadow of a doubt, &amp; therefore confirm all the rest. it is a Phænomenon, that you will be
					in the right to inform yourself about, &amp; that I long to understand. another Phænomenon is, that I read it without finding it out.
					All I remember is, that I thought it not at all <hi rend="italic">English,</hi> &amp; did not much like it; and the reason is plain;
					for the lyric flights &amp; choral flowers suited not at all with the circumstances or character, as he had contrived it.
				</p>
         <p>I sent your letter to Algarotti directly. my <hi rend="italic">Coserelle</hi> came a long while
					ago: from Mr Holles, I suppose; who sent me (without a name), a set of his engravings, when I was
					last in Town, wch (I reckon) is what you mean by your fine presents. the <hi rend="italic">Congresso di Citera</hi> was not one of the
					books: that was my mistake. I like his treatises very well.</p>
         <p>I hope in God the dedicatorial Sonnet has not staid for me. I object nothing to the 2d line, but
					like it the better for Milton, and with him I would read in penult: (give me a shilling) <hi rend="italic">his ghastly smile,</hi>
						&amp;c.: but if you won't put it in, then read <hi rend="italic">wonted</hi> smile, &amp; a little
					before <hi rend="italic">secure from envy.</hi> I see nothing to alter. what I said was the best line is the best line still. do come
					hither, &amp; I will read and criticize</p>
         <q>
            <p>Your amorous ditties all a winter's day.
					</p>
         </q>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu! I am truly Yours. I hope her hair is not red tho'. </salute>
         </closer>
         <postscript>
            <p>I have been abroad, or I had wrote sooner. </p>
