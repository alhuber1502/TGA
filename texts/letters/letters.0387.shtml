         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>When I received your letter I was still detain'd in Town: but am now at last got to
         Cambridge. I applied immediately to Dr Ashton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (who was nearest at hand) for information as to the expences of Eton without naming
         any one's name. he returned me the <span style="font-style:italic">civilest</span> of answers, &amp; that if the boy was to be on the foundation, I had no more to do but
         send him to him, &amp; the business should be done. as to the charges, he was going to
         Eton, &amp; would send me an account from thence; wch he did accordingly on Sunday last,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; here it is inclosed with his second letter. you will easily conceive, that there
         must be additional expences, that can be reduced to no rules, as pocket-money, cloths,
         books, &amp;c: &amp; wch are left to a Father's own discretion.
      </p>
      <p>My notion is, that your Nephew<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> being an only Son, &amp; rather of a delicate constitution, ought not to be exposed to
         the hardships of the College. I know, that the expence in that way is much lessen'd;
         but your Brother has but one Son, &amp; can afford to breed him an Oppidant.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I know, that a Colleger is sooner form'd to scuffle in the world, that is, by drubbing
         &amp; tyranny is made more hardy or more cunning, but these in my eyes are no such desirable
         acquisitions: I know too, that a certain (or very probable) provision for life<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is a thing to be wish'd: but you must remember, what a thing a fellow of King's is.
         in short you will judge for yourselves. if you accept my <span style="font-style:italic">good Friend's</span> offer, I will proceed accordingly: if not, we will thank him, &amp; willingly let him
         recommend to us a cheap boarding-house, not disdaining his protection &amp; encouragement,
         if it can be of any little use to your Nephew. he has married one of Amyand's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Sisters with 12,000£: (I suppose, you know her; she is an enchanting object!), &amp;
         he is settled in the Preachership of Lincolns Inn.
      </p>
      <p>Sure Mr Jon:.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or some one has told you, how your <span style="font-style:italic">good Friend,</span> Mr. L:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been horsewhip'd, trampled, bruised, &amp; piss'd upon, by a Mrs Mackenzie, a sturdy
         Scotch Woman. it was done in an Inn-yard at Hampstead in the face of day, &amp; he has
         put her in the Crown-Office.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is very true. I will not delay this letter to tell you any more stories.
