      <p>I have a tast for the works of Cramputius, &amp; his Scraps; if you can fill twelve baskets
         with such fragments, I have a stomach for 'em all: one should have had a passion for
         Simplicia oneself, if one had lived in those days; she is so open &amp; unreserved in
         her behaviour: the pleasure of having a mistress, that when one made her a compliment,
         &amp; call'd her Spider; should only cry, ehe! I don't doubt but Portia behaved just s[o]
         when Brutus made love to her; this was reckon'd a Scene of great Gallantry I suppose
         at that time, &amp; Q: Crassus Tubero as pretty a fellow with the Women, as the Genie
         Jonquil: I don't know, whither you have forgot Cambridge, or not; it's plain, you
         chuse, only to keep it in mind; it seems to be at this time of year, that the humour
         usually takes you to tell us stories about your coming, but however I would rather
         be deceived, than hear nothing at all of it; so say something of it pray; every body
         in Cambridge knows better than I; who remain
