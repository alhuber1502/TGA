         <div class="salute">Dear Mason </div>
      </div>
      <p>I admire you as the pink of perversity. how did I know about York-Races? &amp; how could
         I be more explicit about our journey. the truth is, I was only too explicit by half,
         for we did not set out in earnest till the 29th of August, being delay'd partly by
         the bad weather, &amp; partly by your Cousin my Lord Perrot, &amp; his assizes, whose train
         we were afraid to overtake, &amp; still more afraid of being overtaken by it. at last
         then we went in the sun &amp; dust broiling to Newcastle, &amp; so by the military road to
         Hexham at night, where it begun to rain, &amp; continued like fury (with very short intervals)
         all the rest of our way. so we got to Carlisle, pass'd a day there in raining &amp; seeing
         delights. next day got to Penrith (more delights) the next dined &amp; lay at Keswick,
         could not go a mile to see anything. Dr Wh: taken ill in the night with an asthma.
         went on however over stupendous hills to Cockermouth: here the Dr grew still worse
         in the night, so we came peppering (&amp; raining) back thro Keswick to Penrith. next
         day lay at Brough, grew better (raining still) &amp; so over Stanemoor home, Sept: 5,
         in a heavy thunder-shower. now you will think from this detail, wch is litterally
         true, that we had better have staid at home. no such thing! I am charm'd with my journey,
         &amp; the Dr dreams of nothing but Skiddaw, &amp; both of us vow to go again the first opportunity.
         I carried Mr Brown to Gibside the 11th of Aug: &amp; took a receipt for him: they did
         not set out for Scotland till the 1st of September, &amp; as yet I have not heard from
         him.
      </p>
      <p>If you are not too much afflicted for the loss of Charles Townshend, now is your time
         to come &amp; see us. in spite of your coquetry we still wish of all things to see you,
         &amp; (bating that vice, &amp; a few more little faults) have a good opinion of you, only
         we are afraid you have a bad heart. I have known purseproud People often complain
         of their poverty, wch is meant as an insult upon the real poor. how dare you practise
         this upon me? don't I know little Clough! here is a fuss indeed about poor threescore
         miles. don't I go galloping five hundred, whenever I please? have done with your tricks,
         &amp; come to Old-Park, for the peaches &amp; grapes send forth a good smell, &amp; the voice
         of the Robin is heard in our land. my services to Mr. Alderston, for he is a good
         creature: But I forget: you are at York again.

         <p>The Doctor presents his compliments to you with great cordiality, &amp; desires your assistance.
            one of his daughters has some turn for drawing, &amp; he would wish her a little instructed
            in the practise. if you have any Professor of the art at York, that would think it
            worth his while to pass about six weeks here, he would be glad to receive him. his
            conditions he would learn from you. if he have any merit in his art, doubtless so
            much the better: but <span style="font-style:italic">above all</span> he must be elderly, &amp; if ugly and ill-made, so much the more acceptable. the reasons
            we leave to your prudence.
