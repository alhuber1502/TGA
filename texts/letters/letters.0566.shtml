      </div>
      <p>I am sincerely pleased with every mark of your kindness, &amp; as such I look upon your
         last letter in particular. I feel for the sorrow you have felt, &amp; yet I can not wish
         to lessen it: that would be to rob you of the best part of your nature, to efface
         from your mind the tender memory of a Father's love, &amp; deprive the Dead of that just
         &amp; grateful tribute wch his goodness demanded from you.
      </p>
      <p>I must however remind you, how happy it was for him, that you were with him to the
         last; that he was sensible perhaps of your care, when every other sense was vanishingâ€“he
         might have lost you last year, might have seen you go before him at a time, when all
         the ills of helpless old-age were coming upon him, &amp; (tho' not destitute of the attention
         &amp; tenderness of others) yet destitute of <span style="font-style:italic">your</span> attention &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">your</span> tenderness. May God preserve you my best Friend! &amp; (Long after my eyes are closed)
         give you that last satisfaction in the gratitude &amp; affection of a Son, wch you have
         given your Father.
      </p>
