         <p>For Gods sake send me your QuÃ¦re's, &amp; I'll do my best to get information upon those Points, you don't understand: I warrant, you
					imagine that People in one College, know the Customs of others; but you mistake, they are quite little Societies by themselves: ye
					Dresses, Language, Customs &amp;c are different in different Colledges: what passes for Wit in one, would not be understood if it were
					carried to another: thus the Men of Peter-house, Pembroke &amp; Clare-hall of course must be Tories; those of Trinity, Rakes; of Kings,
					Scholars; of Sidney, Wigs; of St Johns, Worthy men &amp; so on: now what to say about this Terra Incognita, I don't know; First then it
					is a great old Town, shaped like a Spider, with a nasty lump in the middle of it, &amp; half a dozen scambling long legs: it has 14
					Parishes, 12 Colledges, &amp; 4 Halls, these Halls only entertain Students, who after a term of years, are elected into the
						Colledges: there are 5 ranks in the University, subordinate to the Vice-chancellour, who is chose
					annually: these are [Masters, Fellows, Fellow-Commoners, Pensione]rs, , &amp; Sizers; The Masters of
					Colledges are twelve grey-hair'd Gentlefolks, who are all mad with Pride; the Fellows are sleepy, drunken, dull, illiterate Things; the
					Fellow-Com: are imitatours of the Fellows, or else Beaux, or else nothing: the Pension: grave, formal Sots, who would be thought old;
					or else drink Ale, &amp; sing Songs against ye Excise. The Sizers are Graziers Eldest Sons, who come to get good Learning, that they
					may all be Archbishops of Canterbury: these 2 last Orders are qualified to take Scholarships; one of which, your humble Servt has had
					given him: first they led me into the hall, &amp; there I swore Allegiance to ye King; then I went to a
					room, where I took 50000 Latin Oaths, such as, to wear a Square Cap, to make 6 verses upon the Epistle or Gospel every Sunday morning,
					to chant very loud in Chappel, to wear a clean Surplice, &amp;c: &amp;c: Now as to eating: the
					Fellow-Com: dine at the Fellows Table, their Commons is worth 6s-4d a-week, the Pensioners pay but 2s-4d; if any body don't like their
					Commons, they send down into the Kitchen to know, what's for Sizing: the Cook sends up a Catalogue of
					what there is; &amp; they chuse, what they please: they are obliged to pay for Commons, whither they eat it, or no: there is always
					Plenty enough: the Sizers feast upon the leavings of the rest; as to dress, the Fell: Commoners usually wear a Prunella Gown with
					Sleeves, a hat &amp; no band; but their proper habit has its Sleeves trimmed with Gold-lace, this they only wear at publick Ceremonies;
					neither do the Noblemen use their pr: Habit commonly, but wear only a black Padesoy Gown: the Men of Kings are a sort of University by
					themselves; &amp; differ in Customs from all the rest; every body hates 'em &amp; when Almanzor comes
					to me, our Peoples stare at him, like a Lord-mayors Show, &amp; wonder to see a human Creature among them: if I tell you, I never stirr
					out, perhaps you won't believe me; especially when you know, there's a Club of Wits kept at the Mitre, all such as come from Eton;
					where Alm: would introduce me, if I so pleased:â&#x80;&#x93;yet you will not think it strange, that I don't go abroad, when I tell you, that
					I am got into a room; such [a] hugeous one, that little i is quite
					lost in it; so [that] when I get up in the morning, I begin to travel [tow]ards the middle of it with might &amp; main, &amp; with much ado about noon bate at a great Table, which stands
					half-way it: so then, by that time, (after having pursued my journey full speed); that I arrive at the door, it is so dark &amp; late,
					&amp; I am so tired, that I am obliged to turn back again: so about Midnight I get to the bedside: then, thinks you, I suppose, he goes
					to sleep: hold you a bit; in this Country it is so far from that, that we go to bed to wake, &amp; rise to sleep: in short, those that
					go along the street, do nothing but walk in their sleep: they run against every Post they meet: but I beg pardon, for talking so much
					of myself, since that's not, what you care forâ&#x80;&#x93;(To be continued)</p>
