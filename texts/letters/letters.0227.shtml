         <div class="salute">My dear Doctor</div>
      </div>
      <p>According to my reckoning Mrs Wh: should have been brought to bed before this time;
         yet you say not a syllable of it. if you are so loth to publish <span style="font-style:italic">your productions,</span> you can not wonder at the repugnance I feel to spreading abroad mine. but in truth
         I am not so much against publishing, as against publishing <span style="font-style:italic">this</span>  <span style="font-style:italic">alone.</span> I have two or three Ideas more in my head. what is to come of them? must they too
         come out in the shape of little six-penny flams, dropping one after another, till
         Mr Dodsley thinks fit to collect them with Mr this's Song, and Mr t'other's epigram,
         into a pretty Volume? I am sure Mason must be sensible of this, &amp; therefore can never
         mean what he says. to be sure, Doctor, it must be own'd, that Physick, &amp; indeed all
         Professions, have a bad effect upon the Mind. this it is my Duty, &amp; Interest to maintain;
         but I shall still be very ready to write a Satyr upon the Clergy, &amp; an Epode against
         Historiographers, whenever you are hard press'd; &amp; (if you flatter me) may throw in
         a few lines with somewhat handsome upon Magnesia alba, &amp; Alicant-Soap. as to Humanity
         you know my aversion to it; wch is barbarous &amp; inhuman, but I can not help it. God
         forgive me.
      </p>
      <p>I am not quite of your opinion with regard to Strophe &amp; Antistrophe. setting aside
         the difficulties, methinks it has little or no effect upon the ear, wch scarce perceives
         the regular return of Metres at so great a distance from one another. to make it succeed,
         I am persuaded the Stanza's must not consist of above 9 lines each at the most. Pindar
         has several such Odes.
      </p>
      <p>Ld S: is come, &amp; makes a tall genteel figure in our eyes. his Tutors &amp; He appear to
         like one another mighty well. when we know more of him than his outside, You &amp; the
         Historian shall hear of it. I am going to ask a favour of you, wch I have no better
         pretence for doing, than that I have long been used to give you trouble. it is, that
         you would go to the London Insurance Office in Birchin-Lane for me, &amp; pay two Insurances,
         one of my House at Wansted (Policy, No 9675.) the other of that in Cornhill (No 23470.)
         from Lady-Day next to Lady-Day, 1756. the first is 20 Shillings; the 2d, 12 Shillgs:
         &amp; be pleased to inclose the two Receipts (stamp'd) in a Cover, and send them to me;
         the sooner the better, for I am always in a little apprehension during this season
         of Conflagrations. I know you will excuse me, &amp; therefore will make no excuses. I
         can not think of coming to town, till sometime in April myself.
      </p>
      <p>I know, you have wrote a very obliging Letter [to Tuthill] but as I have not seen
         it, &amp; he is not in my way at present, I leave him to answer for himself.
      </p>
