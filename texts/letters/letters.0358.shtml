         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am not sorry to hear, you are exceeding busy, except as it has deprived me of the
         pleasure I should have in hearing often from you, &amp; as it has been occasion'd by a
         little vexation &amp; disappointment. to find oneself business (I am persuaded) is the
         great art of life; &amp; I am never so angry, as when I hear my acquaintance wishing they
         had been bred to some poking profession, or employ'd in some office of drudgery, as
         if it were pleasanter to be at the command of other People, than at one's own; &amp; as
         if they could not go, unless they were wound up. yet I know and feel, what they mean
         by this complaint: it proves, that some spirit, something of Genius (more than common)
         is required to teach a Man how to employ himself. I say <span style="font-style:italic">a Man,</span> for Women commonly speaking never feel this distemper: they have always something
         to do; time hangs not on their hands (unless they be fine Ladies) a variety of small
         inventions &amp; occupations fill up the void, &amp; their eyes are never open in vain.
      </p>
      <p>I thank you heartily for the Sow. if you have no occasion for her, I have; &amp; if his
         Ldp will be so kind as to drive her up to Town, will gladly give him 40 shillings
         and the Chitterlings into the bargain. I could repay you with the Story of my Lady
         F:r, but (I doubt) you know my Sow already, especially as you dwell near Raby. however
         I'll venture: it may happen, you have not heard it. About 2 months ago Mr. Creswick
         (the D: of Cleveland's managing Man) received an anonymous letter as from a Lady,
         offering him (if he would bring about a match between her &amp; his Lord) 3000£ to be
         paid after marriage out of the Estate. if he came into the proposal, a place was named,
         where he might speak with the Party. he carried the letter directly to the old Lady
         Darlington &amp; they agreed, he should go to the place. he did so, &amp; found there a Man,
         Agent for the Lady: but refusing to treat with any but Principals, after a little
         difficulty was conducted to her in person, &amp; found it was my Lady F: (Sr Ev: F:s fine
         young Widow). what pass'd between them, I know not: but that very night she was at
         Lady Darl:n's Assembly (as she had used to be) &amp; no notice taken. the next morning
         she received a card to say, Lady D: had not expected to see her, <span style="font-style:italic">after what had pass'd:</span> otherwise she would have order'd her Porter not to let her in. the whole affair was
         immediately told to every body. yet she has continued going about to all publick places
         <span style="font-style:italic">tête levée,</span> &amp; solemnly denying the whole to her acquaintance. since that I hear she owns it,
         &amp; says, her Children were unprovided for, &amp; desires to know, wch of her Friends would
         not have done the same? but as neither of these expedients succeed very well, she
         has hired a small house, &amp; is going into the Country for the summer.
      </p>
      <p>Here has just been a Duel between the Duke of Bolton &amp; Mr. Stuart (a Candidate for
         the County of Hampshire at the late Election) what the quarrel was, I do not know:
         but they met near Marybone, &amp; the D: in making a pass over-reached himself, fell down,
         &amp; hurt his knee. the other bid him get up, but he could not. then he bid him ask his
         life, but he would not. so he let him alone, and that's all. Mr. Steuart was slightly
         wounded.
      </p>
      <p>The old Pundles, that sat on Ld G: Sackvile (for they were all such, but two, Gen:
         Cholmondeley, &amp; Ld Albemarle) have at last hammer'd out their sentence. he is declared
         disobedient, &amp; unfit for all military command. it is said, that 9 (out of the 15)
         were for death, but as two-thirds must be unanimous, some of them came over to the
         merciful side. I do not affirm the truth of this. what he will do with himself, no
         body guesses. the poor old Duke went into the country some time ago, &amp; (they say)
         can hardly bear the sight of any body. the unembarass'd countenance, the looks of
         soveraign contempt &amp; superiority, that his Lp bestow'd on his Accusers during the
         tryal, were the admiration of all: but his usual Talents &amp; Art did not appear, in
         short his Cause would not support him. be that as it will, every body blames <span style="font-style:italic">somebody,</span>  who has been out of all temper, &amp; intractable during the whole time. Smith (the
         Aid-de-Camp, and principal Witness for Ld G:) had no sooner finish'd his evidence,
         but he was forbid to mount guard, &amp; order'd to sell out. the Court &amp; the Criminal
         went halves in the expence of the short-hand Writer, so Ld G: has already publish'd
         the Tryal, before the authentic Copy appears; &amp; in it are all the foolish questions,
         that were asked, &amp; the absurdities of his Judges. you may think perhaps he intends
         to go abroad, &amp; hide his head. au contraire, all the World visits him on his condemnation.
         he says himself, his situation is better, than ever it was. the Scotch have all along
         affected to take him under their protection; his Wife has been daily walking with
         Lady Augusta (during the tryal) in Leicester-Gardens, &amp; Ld B:s Chariot stands at his
         door by the hour.
      </p>
      <p>Ld Ferrers has entertained the Town for three days. I was not there, but Mason &amp; Stonhewer
         were in the D: of Ancaster's Gallery &amp; in the greatest danger (wch I believe they
         do not yet know themselves) for the Cell underneath them (to wch the Prisoner retires)
         was on fire during the tryal, &amp; the D: of Anc:r with the Workmen by sawing away some
         timbers &amp; other assistance contrived to put it out without any alarm given to the
         Court: several now recollect they smelt burning &amp; heard a noise of sawing, but no
         one guest at the cause. Miss Johnson, Daughter to the murther'd Man, appeard so cool,
         &amp; gave so gentle an evidence, that at first sight every one concluded, she was bought
         off: but this could do him little good. the Surgeon &amp; his own Servants laid open such
         a scene of barbarity &amp; long-meditated malice, as left no room for his plea of Lunacy,
         nor any thought of pity in the hearers. the oddest thing was this plea of temporary
         Lunacy, &amp; his producing two Brothers of his to prove it, one a Clergyman (suspended
         for Methodism by the Bp of London) the other a sort of Squire, that goes in the countrey
         by the name of <span style="font-style:italic">Ragged &amp; Dangerous.</span>  he managed the cause himself with more cleverness than any of his Counsell, &amp; (when
         found guilty) ask'd pardon for his plea, &amp; laid it upon the persuasions of his family.
         Mrs Shirley (his Mother) Lady Huntingdon, &amp; others of the relations were at Court
         yesterday with a petition for mercy, but on the 5th of May he is to be hang'd at Tyburn.
      </p>
      <p>The Town are reading the K: of Prussia's Poetry (Le Philosophe sans Souci) &amp; I have
         done, like the Town. they do not seem so sick of it, as I am. it is all the scum of
         Voltaire and Ld Bolingbroke, the <span style="font-style:italic">Crambe recocta</span>  of our worst Free-thinkers, toss'd up in German-French rhyme. Tristram Shandy is
         still a greater object of admiration, the Man as well as the Book. one is invited
         to dinner, where he dines, a fortnight beforehand. his portrait is done by Reynolds,
         &amp; now engraving. Dodsley gives 700£ for a second edition, &amp; two new volumes not yet
         written; &amp; tomorrow will come out two Volumes of Sermons by him. your Friend Mr. Hall
         has printed two Lyric Epistles, one to my Cousin Shandy on his coming to Town, the
         other to the grown Gentlewomen, the Misses of York: they seem to me to be absolute
         madness. these are the best lines in them
      </p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>I'll tell you a story of Elijah – <br /> Close by a Mob of Children stood <br /> Commenting on his sober mood &amp;c: <br /> And back'd them (their opinions) like such sort of folks <br /> With a few stones &amp; a few jokes: <br /> Till, weary of their pelting &amp; their prattle, <br /> He order'd out his Bears to battle. <br /> It was delightful fun <br /> To see them run <br /> And eat up the young Cattle.

      <p>The 7th Vol: of Buffon is come over: do you chuse to have it?</p>
      <p>Poor Lady Cobham is at last deliverd from a painful life. she has given Miss Speed
         above 30,000£.
      </p>
      <p>Mr Brown is well: I heard from him yesterday, &amp; think of visiting him soon. Mason
         &amp; Stonhewer are both in Town &amp; (if they were here) would send their best Comp:ts to
         you &amp; Mrs. Wh:n with mine. you see, I have left no room for weather: yet I have observed
         the birth of the spring, wch (tho' backward) is very beautiful at present. mind, from
         this day the Therm:r goes to its old place below in the yard, &amp; so pray let its Sister
         do. Mr Stillingfleet (with whom I am grown acquainted) has convinced me, it ought
         to do so.
