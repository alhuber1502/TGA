				     <p>I have the pleasure to tell you that after repeating once again his infusion of Poppies, wch caused each time an entire cessation
					from pain, &amp; an easy perspiration for near 24 hours, Mr Chute has had no return of his tortures, but for these four days has
					continued in a very tolerable state, chearful enough &amp; in good spirits in the day-time, his appetite beginning to return, &amp; all
					last night pass'd in quiet &amp; natural sleep. but he is (as you may imagine) still nail'd to his bed, &amp; much weaken'd. God knows,
					when he will be able to get up, or bear any motion, &amp; the least cold, as Autumn is coming on, will certainly bring it all back
					again. I am quite of your opinion about going to Town, as soon as it is possible; &amp; had of my own accord talk'd about it, but he
					seems rather set against it: however I hope to prevail. as to the Tracies, I think he told me just
					before this illness, that they were all coming, &amp; he had wrote to hinder it on some pretence or other. what you say about Mrs
						P: is very true. I only mention'd her, because she was more within reach than any body else: but I
					have now no farther thought of danger.</p>
				     <p>We are much obliged to you for your News, &amp; hope, when you have leisure, again to hear from you.</p>
