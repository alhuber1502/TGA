            <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I hope in God, before now you have given Mr Barrett his answer. I always supposed you would
						refuse, &amp; told him so: yet as he does not write to me, I much doubt whether you have acquainted
					him of it. why, did not I desire you to do so out of hand? &amp; did not I make my civilities to Mrs. Nicholls? 'tis sure I intended
					both one &amp; the other: but you never allow for business: why, I am selling an estate, &amp; over head &amp; ears in writings.
				</p>
         <p>Next week I come to Cambridge. pray let me find a letter from you there, telling me the way to Lovingland: for thither I come, as soon as I have been sworn in, &amp; subscribed,
					&amp; been at Church. poor Mr Spence was found drown'd in his own garden at Byfield: probably (being paralytic) he fell into the water, &amp; had no one near to help him: so <hi rend="italic">History</hi> has lost two of her chief supports almost at once. let us pray for their
						Successors! his Danish Majesty has had a Diarrh√¶a, so could not
					partake of Dr Marriot's collation: if he goes thither at all, I would contrive not to be present at
					the time.</p>
