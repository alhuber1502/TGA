         <div class="salute">Dear Mason </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am almost blind with a great cold, &amp; should not have wrote to you today, if you
         did not hurry me to send back this elegy.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> my advices are allways at your service to take or to refuse, therefore you should
         not call them <span style="font-style:italic">severe.</span> you know I do not love, much less pique myself on criticism, and think even a bad
         verse as good a thing or better, than the best observation, that ever was made upon
         it. I like greatly what you have now sent me, particularly the spirit &amp; sentiment
         of it. the disposition of the whole too is natural &amp; elegiac. as to the expression
         I would venture to say (did you not forbid me)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that it is sometimes too <span style="font-style:italic">easy.</span> the last line I protest against. (this, you will say, is worse, than blotting out
         rhymes) the descriptive part is excellent, yet I am sorry for the name of <span style="font-style:italic">Cutthorpe.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I had rather Vertumnus &amp; Flora did not appear in person. the word <span style="font-style:italic">lopt</span> sounds like a Farmer, or a Man of taste. <span style="font-style:italic">a Mountain hoar, the savage</span> &amp;c: is a very good line, yet I allways doubt, if this ungrammatical construction
         be allowable. in common speech it is usual, but not in writing even prose; &amp; I think,
         Milton (tho' hard-press'd by his short metre in the Penseroso) yet finds a way to
         bring in his <span style="font-style:italic">thats,</span> his <span style="font-style:italic">whos,</span> &amp; his <span style="font-style:italic">whiches. fair unfold The wide-spread</span> &amp;c: <span style="font-style:italic">fair</span> is weakly; <span style="font-style:italic">wide-spread</span> is contained in <span style="font-style:italic">unfold.</span> by <span style="font-style:italic">amber</span> mead I understand the yellow gleam of a meadow cover'd with marshmarygolds &amp; butterflowers.
         is not it so? the two first lines (the 2d especially) I do not admire. I read <span style="font-style:italic">Did Fancy</span> wake not – <span style="font-style:italic">refuse</span> one votive strain. you will ask me, why? I do not know. as to <span style="font-style:italic">votive</span> it is like <span style="font-style:italic">delegated,</span> one of the words you love. I also read <span style="font-style:italic">How</span> well does Mem'ry &amp;c: for the same no reason. <span style="font-style:italic">Enough, it all was his</span> &amp;c: I like the sense, but it is not sufficiently clear. as to the versification,
         do not you perceive that you make the pause on the fourth syllable in almost every
         other line?
      </p>
      <p>Now I desire, you would neither think me severe, nor at all regard what I say any
         farther, than it coincides with your own judgement: for the Child deserves your partiality,
         it is a healthy well-made boy with an ingenuous countenance,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; promises to live long. I would only wash its face, dress it a little, make it walk
         upright &amp; strong, &amp; keep it from learning <span style="font-style:italic">paw</span> words.
      </p>
      <p>I never saw more than two volumes of Pelloutier,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; repent, that I ever read them. he is an idle Man of some learning, that would make
         all the world <span style="font-style:italic">Celts,</span> whether they will or no. <span style="font-style:italic">Locus est &amp; pluribus umbris</span> is a very good Motto;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you need look no farther: I can not find the other passage, nor look for it with
         <span style="font-style:italic">these eyes.</span></p>
