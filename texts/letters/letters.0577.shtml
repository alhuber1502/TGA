      </div>
      <p>I am sorry for your disappointments &amp; my own. do not believe, that I am cold to Mr
         Cl:s translation: on the contrary I long to see it, &amp; wonder you should hesitate for
         want of Franks (wch here I have no means of getting) do I care about postage, do you
         think?
      </p>
      <p>On Wednesday next I go (for a few days) with Mons: de B: to London. his cursed F:r
         will have him home in the autumn, &amp; he must pass thro France to improve his talents
         &amp; morals. he goes for Dover on Friday. I have seen (I own) with pleasure the efforts
         you have made to recommend me to him, <span style="font-style:italic">sed non ego credulus illis,</span>  nor I fear, he neither. he gives me too much pleasure, &amp; at least <span style="font-style:italic">an equal share</span> of inquietude. you do not understand him so well as I do, but I leave my meaning
         imperfect, till we meet. I have never met with so extraordinary a Person. God bless
         him! I am unable to talk to you about any thing else, I think.
      </p>
      <p>I wonder'd, you should think of Paris at the time of the Dauphin's marriage: it will
         be a frippery spectacle, &amp; the expence of every thing triple. as to <span style="font-style:italic">Wales,</span>  doubtless I should wish it this summer, but  I can answer for nothing, my own employment
         so sticks in my stomach, &amp; troubles my conscience. when I return hither, I will write
         to you better &amp; more fully.
      </p>
