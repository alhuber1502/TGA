      </div>
      <p>I am extremely obliged to you [for the] kind attention you bestow on me &amp; my affairs.
         I have not been a sufferer by this calamity: it was on the other side of the street,
         &amp; did not reach so far as the houses opposite to mine: but there was an Attorney,
         who had writings belonging to me in his hands, that had his house burnt down among
         the first: yet he has had the good fortune to save all his papers. the fire is said
         to have begun in the chamber of that poor Glass-Organist who lodged at a Coffee-house
         in Swithin's-Alley, &amp; perish'd in the flames. two other Persons were destroy'd (in
         the charitable office of assisting their friends) by the fall of some buildings. last
         night there was another fire in Lincolns Inn Fields, that burnt the Sardinian Ambassador's
         Chappel &amp; Stables with some adjacent houses. 'tis strange, that we all of us (here
         in Town) lay ourselves down every night on our Funeral Pile ready made, &amp; compose
         ourselves to rest; while every drunken Footman, &amp; drowsy Old-Woman, has a candle ready
         to light it before the morning.
      </p>
      <p>You will have heard of Hawke's Victory before this can reach you (perhaps by an Express).
         [the Soleil Royal], Monsr de Conflans own Ship of [80 guns, &amp; the Hero of] 74, were
         driven on Shore &amp; [subsequently burnt], two sunk (capital Ships) with [all their crews,
         fo]r it blew a storm during the whole [day, so that none] could be saved out of them.
         eight [after throwin]g over their cannon were able to run [into th]e mouth of a shallow
         river (where, if the [wi]nd will permit, it is probable, they may be set on fire)
         &amp; eight ran away, &amp; are supposed to have got into Rochefort. two of Hawke's Fleet
         (of 70 &amp; 60 guns) out of eagerness ran aground, &amp; are lost, but most of the Men preserved,
         &amp; brought off. there is an end of the invasion, unless you are afraid of Thurot, who
         is hovering off Scotland. it is an odd contemplation, that <span style="font-style:italic">somebody</span>  should have lived long enough to grow a great &amp; glorious Monarch. as to the Nation,
         I fear, it will not know how to behave itself, being just in the circumstances of
         a Chambermaid, that has got the 20,000Â£ Prize in the Lottery.
      </p>
      <p>You mistake me; I was always a Friend to <span style="font-style:italic">Employment,</span> &amp; no Foe to Money: but they are no friends to each other. promise me to be always
         busy, &amp; I will allow you to be rich.
      </p>
