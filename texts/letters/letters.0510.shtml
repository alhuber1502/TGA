         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I have received a letter from Howe, another from Mr Beattie, &amp; a third, wch was a
         printed Catalogue, from London. the parcel sent to Cambridge was a set of Algarotti's
         works for your Library, wch need not be impatient, if it remain unopen'd, till I come.
         the Doctor &amp; I came hither on Saturday last: he return'd on Wednesday, &amp; I set out
         for London (pray for me!) at ten o'clock tomorrow night. you will please to direct
         to me at Roberts's, as usual, &amp; when it is convenient I shall be glad of my Bill.
         I will trouble you also to give notice of my motions to Miss Antrobus, as soon as
         you can.
      </p>
      <p>Here has been Ld Holdernesse's ugly face, since I was here, &amp; here actually is Mr
         Weddell, who enquires after you. Pa: is in London with his Brother, who is desperate:
         if he dies, We shall not be a shilling the better, so we are really very sorrowful.
         Mason desires his love to you.
