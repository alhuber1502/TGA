					find being from you agrees as ill with me, as if I never had felt your absence before: I have composed a hymn about it mighty moving,
					&amp; thrum it perpetually, for I've changed my harp into a harpsicord &amp; am as melodious, as the Day is long: I am sorry, I can
					give you no further Information about Mr Cornwallis, there was a Congregation held yesterday, but
					nothing further done about his degree for the present: I received a long letter mighty pretty, in Latin, from West yesterday; partly about butter'd Turnips, partly about an Eclipse, that I understood no more than the Man in
					the Moon; he desired his love to you in English: </p>
         <p>I wish a great deal of happiness to you, a good journey to Houghton, &amp; a more entertaining
