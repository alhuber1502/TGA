            <salute>Dear Doctor</salute>
         </opener>
         <p> I feel very ungrateful (wch is the most uneasy of all feelings) in that I have never once enquired, how you and your family enjoy
					the region of air &amp; sunshine, into which you are removed, &amp; with what contempt you look back
					on the perpetual fogs, that hang over Mrs Payne &amp; Mrs Paterson. yet you certainly have not been
					the less in my mind: that at least has pack'd up with you, has help'd Mrs. Wharton to arrange the mantle-piece, &amp; drank tea <hi rend="italic">next summer</hi> in the Grotto. but I am much puzzled about the Bishop &amp; his fixtures, &amp; do not stomach the loss of that money.</p>
         <p>Would you know, what I am doing? I doubt, you have been told already, &amp; hold my employment cheap enough: but every one must judge
					of his own <hi rend="italic">capabilities,</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> his amusements according to his disposition. the drift
					of my present studies is to know, wherever I am, what lies within reach, that may be worth seeing. whether it be Building, ruin, park,
					garden, prospect, picture, or monument; to whom it does, or has belong'd, &amp; what has been the characteristick, &amp; taste of
					different ages. you will say, this is the object of all Antiquaries, but pray, what Antiquary ever saw these objects in the same light,
					or desired to know them for a like reason? in short say what you please, I am persuaded, whenever my list is finish'd, you will approve it, &amp; think it of no small use. my spirits are very near the <hi rend="italic">freezing
						point,</hi> &amp; for some hours of the day this exercise by its warmth &amp; gentle motion serves to raise them a few degrees higher.
					I hope the misfortune, that has befall'n Mrs. Cibber's Canary-bird will not be the ruin of <hi rend="italic">Agis.</hi>
					 it is probable you will have curiosity enough to see it, as it comes from the Writer of Douglas: I
					expect your opinion. I am told, that Swift's History of the Tory-Administration is in the Press, &amp;
					that Stuart's Attica will be out this spring.</p>
