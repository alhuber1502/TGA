         <p>The beginning of next spring is the time determined for our return at furthest; possibly it may be before that time. How the interim
					will be employed, or what route we shall take, is not so certain. If we remain friends with France, upon leaving this country we shall
					cross over to Venice, and so return through the cities north of the Po to Genoa; from thence take a felucca to Marseilles, and come
					back through Paris. If the contrary fall out, which seems not unlikely, we must make the Milanese, and those parts of Italy, in our way
					to Venice; from thence pass through the Tirol into Germany, and come home by the Low-Countries. As for Florence, it has been gayer than
					ordinary for this last month, being one round of balls and entertainments, occasioned by the arrival of a great Milanese Lady; for the
					only thing the Italians shine in, is their reception of strangers. At such times every thing is magnificence: The more remarkable, as
					in their ordinary course of life they are parsimonious, even to a degree of nastiness. I saw in one of the vastest palaces in Rome
					(that of Prince Pamfilio) the apartment which he himself inhabited, a bed that most servants in England would disdain to lie in, and
					furniture much like that of a soph at Cambridge, for convenience and neatness. This man is worth
						30,000<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> sterling a year. As for eating, there are not two Cardinals in Rome that allow more than six paoli,
					which is three shillings a day, for the expence of their table; and you may imagine they are still
					less extravagant here than there. But when they receive a visit from any friend, their houses and persons are set out to the greatest
					advantage, and appear in all their splendour; it is, indeed, from a motive of vanity, and with the hopes of having it repaid them with
					interest, whenever they have occasion to return the visit. I call visits going from one city of Italy to another; for it is not so
					among acquaintance of the same place on common occasions. The new Pope has retrenched the charges of his own table to a sequin (10s.) a
					meal. The applause which all he says and does meets with, is enough to encourage him really to deserve fame. They say he is an able and
					honest man; he is reckoned a wit too. The other day, when the Senator of Rome came to wait upon him, at the first compliments he made
					him the Pope pulled off his cap: His Master of the Ceremonies, who stood by his side, touched him softly, as to warn him that such a
					condescension was too great in him, and out of all manner of rule: Upon which he turned to him and said, 'Oh! I cry you mercy, good
					Master, it is true, I am but a Novice of a Pope; I have not yet so much as learned ill manners.' [...]</p>
