            <salute>Dear Mr Gray</salute>
         </opener>
         <p> As bad as Your Verses were, they are Yours, &amp; therefore when I get back to York Ill paste them
					carefully in the first page of My Shakespeare to inhance its Value for I intend it to be put in My Marriage Settlement as a Provision
					for my Younger Daughters. My Eldest Boy is to be provided for out of Huttons Nose &amp; I have just
					now writ to Stonehewer to get a reversionary grant of a Commission of Hawkers &amp; Pedlars for my second Son. When this matter is
					settled I hope soon to be in possession of My gentle Argentile. For really &amp; sincerely I have
					seen her, got her Consent have written to her Father &amp; Letters now pass evry Post relative to her
					Jointure. After all I verily beleive it wont do. And am at present much out of sorts about it. and was it not that I love her more than
					ever, should wish I had been soused Head &amp; Ears at Hartlepool e'er I had ventured to make my proposals. But no more of this. You
					wont pity me now, no more than you did when I was in residence &amp; Sore Eyes.</p>
         <p>I am here about the Commission concerning My Exchange of Glebe wch I hope to finish next Wednesday.
					After wch I shall go soon either to Hull or York unless Lord Holdernesse stops me by coming here next Week, wch tho he talks of doing,
					I fancy he will not.</p>
         <p>I know nothing of Politics except from a Letter of Frasers, that
					He is taken from Lord Northumberland by the Duke of Grafton &amp; is just where he was four years ago with Lord Holdernesse. Poor
					Fellow I pity him, but I hope Stonehewer will be good to him for he is a worthy Creature. I have no
					beleif however in the Duration of this Ministry unless Mr Pitt adds himself to it, which I fancy hell hardly do.
				</p>
         <p>You will be very cross I know at this Letter, since it will tell you that I shall not come to Hartlepool. For I know You want
					somebody that you may Frump &amp; scold &amp; say sharp things to. And my Dovelike temper would be
						n[o]thing
					 in the world for you after a g[ulp] of Sea Water.
					 However my Eyes are [so] perfectly well, that I laugh at the
					Scurvy.</p>
         <p>I direct this to Dr Whartons on Supposition that you are tird of Hartlepool. Give my best compliments to the Dr &amp; His Lady &amp;
					beleive me to be as much as I can be any bodys at present </p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Yours most sincerely </salute>
