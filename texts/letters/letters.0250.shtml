      <p>It is a good number of years since I applied to you on a like occasion. your ready
         compliance with my desire at that time gives me confidence to do so at present, but
         how far it is practicable or proper for you to satisfy me in this case I leave entirely
         to your own judgement.

      <p>Dr Long, the Master of Pembroke Hall, (I am told) is either dying or dead. Mr Brown,
         the President &amp; Sen: Fellow, is a Person entirely unknown to the World, whom those
         few, that know, love &amp; esteem; &amp; to whom I myself have a thousand obligations. his
         interest in the College is considerable; but as among 11 or 12 Fellows, who elect,
         there are (you will not doubt) some, that will regard their own interest rather more
         than his, a word from you to Mr F:, or the D: of Bd, or any other great Man, may contribute
         to recommend him, &amp; incline these doubtful People to vote for him. Mr Mason, who is
         himself qualified to be Master, &amp; might probably enough succeed, I am fully persuaded
         (tho' you will think there is not common Sense in the assertion) will do every thing
         to further Mr Brown's election. he (if you will let him know, when you are at home,)
         will wait upon you, &amp; give you any necessary information. I can answer for Mr Bs Principles
         in Government, as I can for my own, that they are those of every true &amp; rational Whig.
         perhaps you may hear the contrary said; &amp; I ought not to conceal from you, that he
         is one of the plainest, worthiest &amp; most honest Men I ever met with, but this ought
         to be a secret. the Antagonist I apprehend is a Mr Addison, a <span style="font-style:italic">Creature</span> of your Uncle &amp; prefer'd by him (do not think, I say this, to add a spur to you,
         for I flatter myself, it is not necessary) he will have the Bp of Chester's assistance,
         &amp; that of the Heads of Colleges, (who know him for a staunch Man,) &amp; consequently,
         of the D: of Newc:le. the thing (supposing Dr L: dead) must be decided in 8 or 10
         days, I believe, the obligation you will lay upon me by this, will be as great or
         greater than if I myself were the immediate object of your kindness. but I repeat,
         that You only are to judge, how far it can answer the end I propose. Mason comes to
         Town from Tunbridge today, &amp; will stay there, I imagine, some days.

         <p>When I mention'd the D: of Bd, I forgot that Mr Franklyn may have some weight there.
            he is a mortal enemy of my Mr Brown.
