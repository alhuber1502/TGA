            <salute> Sir </salute>
         </opener>
         <p> I am desired by Count Algarotti to forward the two inclosed Letters to You &amp; M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason; and as I am at a loss where to direct to M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason, I take the Liberty of charging you with a
					double Postage on his Account, as well as of begging you to take under your Care the letter directed to him. He the Count has sent two
					or three little treatises of his, that have been lately printed at Leghorn, as a present to you &amp;
						M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mason: they are imbarqued in the <hi>Beverley</hi>, Capt<hi rend="super">n</hi> Allen, but will probably be
					delivered to you by an unknown Hand: 'tis upon this occasion, he tells me, that he has wrote to you
					both; and if upon the Receipt of his Letter, or of his Books, you think proper to write him an answer, the best direction will be
					this.</p>
         <q> A Monsieur Monsieur Le Comte Algarotti<lb/>     Chambellan de S.M. Le Roy de Prusse<lb/>        
					                a Bologne — </q>
         <p>En Italie.</p>
         <p> In my last Letter to M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Brown, Sir, I begged he would return you my best Acknowledgements for the very
					obliging Note with which you had favoured me by his means, and therefore I do not pretend to say any thing more to it here, except
					merely to thank you for the kind thought of transmitting <hi>Ossian the son of Fingal</hi> to me in Italy; but I can now tell you, Sir,
					that I have met with him, and that I have read him, at least Macpherson's English prose translation of Ossian's Poems, which has
					sufficed to give me such an Idea of the Original, as may, I hope, correspond with your declared Opinion of it. Tho' but ill in Health
					at present, next Wednesday Morning I shall set out towards the Ascension at Venice, and afterwards I believe by short Stages, &amp;
					slow Movements to Paris, and the German Spa. You see, Sir, I presume much upon your Goodnature in communicating my concerns to You; if
					too much, blame yourself, Sir, who have encouraged me to it, or excuse it for once from one, who is with the highest Respect</p>
