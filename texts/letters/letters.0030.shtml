      <p>It rains, 'tis Sunday, this is the country; three circumstances so dull in conjunction
         with the dulness of my nature are like to give birth to an admirable production; I
         hope you will receive it, as you would a Michaelmas Goose from a Tenant; since I send
         it, not that I believe you have a taste for an awkward fat creature, but because I
         have no better way of showing my good-will: your name, I assure you, has been propagated
         in these countries by a Convert of yours, one Cambridge;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he has brought over his whole family to you; they were before pretty good Whigs,
         but now they are absolute Walpolians: we have hardly any body in the Parish, but knows
         exactly the Dimensions of the hall &amp; Saloon at Houghton, &amp; begins to believe, that
         the Lanthorn<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is not quite so great a Consumer of the fat of the land, as disaffected persons have
         said: for your reputation we keep to ourselves that, of your not Hunting, nor drinking
         Hogan;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> e'er a one of which would be sufficient here to lay your honour in the Dust: I received
         a little Billet from my dear Horace, as if he had not heard from me: whereas I wrote
         last Sunday; we have not so good an opportunity here, as I could wish, not lying conveniently
         for the Post; but to[morow sennight]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I hope to be in town, &amp; not long after at Cambridge.</p>
