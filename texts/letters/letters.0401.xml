					       <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I went as soon as I received your last letter, to chuse papers for you at Bromwich's. I applaud
					your determination, for it is mere pedantry in Gothicism to stick to nothing but altars &amp; tombs, &amp; there is no end of it, if we
					are to sit upon nothing but Coronation-chairs, nor drink out of nothing but chalices &amp; flagons. the idea is sufficiently kept up,
					if we live in an ancient house, but with modern conveniences about us. nobody will expect the inhabitants to wear ruffs &amp;
					farthingales. besides these things are not to be had, unless we make them ourselves.</p>
				     <p>I have however ventured to bespeak (for the staircase) the stucco-paper of 3D a yard, wch I mention'd to you before. it is rather
					pretty, &amp; nearly Gothick. the border is entirely so, &amp; where it runs horizontally, will be very proper; where perpendicularly,
					not altogether so: I do not see, how this could be avoided. the crimson paper is the handsomest I ever saw; from its simplicity, I
					believe, as it is nothing but the same thing repeated throughout. Mr. Trevor (Hambden ) design'd it
					for his own use. the border is a spiral scroll, also the prettiest I have seen. this paper is 8D: a yard. the blew is the most
					extravagant, a mohair-flock paper of a shilling a yard, wch I fear you will blame me for; but it was so handsome, &amp; look'd so warm,
					I could not resist it. the pattern is small, &amp; will look like a cutvelvet: the border a scroll like the last, but on a larger
					scale. you will ask, why the crimson (wch was to be the best) is not a mohair-paper too? because it would have no effect in that sort
					of pattern; &amp; it is as handsome as it need to be, without that expence. the library paper is a cloth-colour: all I can say for it
					is, that it was the next best design they had after the former. I think it is 7D1/2 a yard. they do not keep any quantity by them (only
					samples of each sort) but promise, they shall be finish'd in a week, &amp; sent to your Brother's, with whom I have left the bill, as I
					go myself to Cambridge in a day or two. indeed this is a very improper time to trouble him, tho' when I call'd there last night, I was
					told she was a great <hi rend="italic">deal better.</hi> I did not know of his loss till you told me: on wch I went to ask how they did, &amp; found him truly in a very deplorable situation.
					he said he had wrote to you, but I do not know, whether he was able to give you a full acco[...]
