   <div class="tei_body">
      <p>My God! Mr Chute in England? what &amp; have you seen him? and did he say nothing to you?
         not a Word of me! such was my Conversation, when I first heard News so surprising,
         with a Person, that (when I reflect) it is indeed no great Wonder You did not much
         interrogate concerning me, as you knew nothing of what has past of late.
      </p>
      <p>But let me ask you yourself, have a few Years totally erased me from your Memory?
         You are generous enough perhaps to forget all the Obligations I have to you, but is
         it Generosity to forget the Person you have obliged too? while I remember myself,
         I can not but remember you; &amp; consequently can not but wonder, when I find no where
         one Line, one Syllable, to tell me you are arrived. I will venture to say, there is
         no body in England however nearly connected with you, that has seen you with more
         real Joy &amp; Affection than I shall. You are, it seems, gone into the Country whither
         (had I any Reason to think you wish'd to see me) I should immediately have follow'd
         you: as it is, I am returning to Cambridge; but with Intention to come back to Town
         again, whenever you do; if you will let me know the Time, &amp; Place. 
      </p>
      <p>I readily set Mr Wh:d free from all Imputations. he is a fine young Personage in a
         Coat all over Spangles just come over from the Tour of Europe to take Possession,
         &amp; be married: &amp; consequently can't be supposed to think of any Thing, or remember
         any body. but You —! however I don't altogether clear him. he might have said something
         to one, who remembers him when he was but a Pout. nevertheless I desire my hearty
         Gratulations to him, &amp; say I wish him more Spangles, &amp; more Estates, &amp; more Wives.
