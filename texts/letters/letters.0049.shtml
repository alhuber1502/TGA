      <p>I am in good hopes, that by this time the Eclipse is over with you, &amp; that your two
         Satellit's have recover'd their usual light; the Sublimity of which two metaphors,
         after you have taken them out of their pantoufles, &amp; reduced 'em to their just value,
         will be found to amount to my wishes for your health, &amp; that of your eyes, whose warmth
         I have been too sensible of, when they used to shine upon me, not to be very apprehensive
         of any damage that might befall 'em: I should have taken care to write upon Green
         paper, &amp; dip'd my Pen in Copperas-water, if you had not assured me, that they were
         on the mending hand, &amp; pretty well able to sustain the whitemaking rays: now as for
         the transactions here, you are to be ascertain'd; that the Man at the Mitre has cut
         his throat, that one Mr White of Emanuel a week ago drown'd himself, but since that
         has been seen a few miles of, having the appearance of one that had never been drown'd;
         wherefore it is by many conjectured, that he walketh: Dr Bouquets verses have been
         return'd by Mr Vice-chancellour to undergo several corrections; the old Man's invention
         is much [admired as] having found out a way to make bawdy verses upon a Burying: the
         wind was so high last night, that I every minute expected to pay you a visit at London
         perforce, which was the place I certainly should have directed the storm to, if I
         had been obliged to ride in the Whirlwind: if I don't hear from you this week, I shall
         be in a thousand Tyrrit's &amp; frights about you;
      </p>
