            <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I intend to return you the letters by tomorrow's Fly, if nothing hinders. I am never the wiser, nor
					the more able to account for T:s letter to Lady L: (wch gave occasion to all the rest) it still looks
					like the suggestion of his Wife working upon his own natural irritability, &amp; the sort of request made in it for the Berwick-living
					(at so improper a time) is not any other way to be accounted for. the <hi rend="italic">sensible &amp; manly</hi> answer to it (I must own) I can not easily digest, especially the end of it: it is plain, as he wrote on, he work'd
					his temper into a ferment, till at last it absolutely turn'd sower. I can not help his temper, but his heart may (for all that) be
					right. in the second letter he is conscious, he had gone too far in his expressions, &amp; tries to give them a sense they will not
					bear: but I allow he is throughout too angry &amp; too contemptuous. your last letter to him (tho' I never saw it) I conclude has done
					no hurt, perhaps has softened him a little. every thing depends upon the manner of their meeting in Devonshire, wch by this time you
					probably know. I do not yet see, why all this passion, why all this trouble of justifying himself to a Man, for whom he never had any
					kindness or regard, &amp; who can be of little use to him in point of interest. Temp: is too precipitate, too rough too in his
					expressions, too much the aggressor, if he thinks Ld L: really his Friend; and if he does not, how in the midst of his resentment can
					he bring himself to shew a desire of accepting farther favours from him? I yet have some little hope, that all may come right again, at
					least right enough for our purpose; for I am more convinced of T:s contempt &amp; want of esteem for L:, than I am of L:s aversion, or
					neglect of T:.</p>
         <p>Mason is here with us, &amp; will stay (I should hope) some time: he is even going to hire a small house opposite to Peter-house, wch
					he can not inhabit till next winter. Mr. Hutton being dead, he has now a landed estate, the income of
					which in a few years will be considerable.</p>
         <p>old Smith of Trinity is dead, &amp; Dr Hinchliffe will probably
					succeed him, tho' Dr Ross &amp; Brocket are also Competitors for it.
					are your India-paper, your Axminster-carpets, your Sofas &amp;
						Pech√©s-mortels, in great forwardness? have you read Mr. Anstey,
					&amp; the Historical doubts?</p>
