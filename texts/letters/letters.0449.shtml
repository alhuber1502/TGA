      <p>I received your letter at Southampton, &amp; as I would wish to treat every body according
         to their own rule &amp; measure of good-breeding, have against my inclination waited till
         now, before I answer'd it, purely out of fear &amp; respect, &amp; an ingenuous diffidence
         of my own abilities. if you will not take this as an excuse, accept it at least as
         a well-turn'd period, wch is always my principal concern. 
      </p>
      <p>So I proceed to tell you, that my health is much improved by the sea; not that I drank
         of it, or bathed in it, as the <span style="font-style:italic">common people</span> do: no! I only walk'd by it, &amp; look'd upon it. the climate is remarkably mild, even
         in Octob: &amp; November. no snow has been seen to lie there for these 30 years past.
         the myrtles grow in the ground against the houses, &amp; Guernsey-Lillies bloom in every
         window. the Town clean &amp; well-built, surrounded by its old stone-walls with their
         towers &amp; gateways, stands at the point of a peninsula, &amp; opens full south to an arm
         of the sea, wch having form'd two beautiful bays on each hand of it stretches away
         in direct view till it joins the British Channel. it is skirted on either side with
         gently-rising grounds cloath'd with thick wood, &amp; directly cross its mouth rise the
         high lands of the Isle of Wight at distance, but distinctly seen. in the bosom of
         the woods (conceal'd from profane eyes) lie hid the ruins of Netteleyabbey.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there may be richer &amp; greater houses of religion, but the Abbot is content with his
         situation. see there at the top of that hanging meadow under the shade of those old
         trees, that bend into a half-circle about it, he is walking slowly (good Man!) &amp; bidding
         his beads for the souls of his Benefactors, interr'd in that venerable pile, that
         lies beneath him. beyond it (the meadow still descending) nods a thicket of oaks,
         that mask the building, &amp; have excluded a view too garish, &amp; too luxuriant for a holy
         eye, only on either hand they leave an opening to the blew glittering sea. did not
         you observe how, as that white sail shot by &amp; was lost, he turn'd &amp; cross'd himself,
         to drive the Tempter from him, that had thrown that distraction in his way. I should
         tell you, that the Ferryman, who row'd me, a lusty young Fellow, told me, that he
         would not for all the world pass a night at the Abbey, (there were such things seen
         near it,) tho' there was a power of money hid there. from thence I went to Salisbury,
         Wilton, &amp; Stone-Henge,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but of these things I say no more: they will be publish'd at the University-Press.
      </p>
      <p>I have been at London this month, that tiresome dull place! where all people under
         thirty find so much amusement. the Opera with Manzuoli<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in it opens on Saturday, &amp; I go to C: the Wednesday preceding. the Ministry are all
         together by the ears, so are the Opposition: the only doubt is wch will be the weakest:
         I am afraid, I know. the sentence of Alma-Mater,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of the North-Briton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; of D'Eon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are defer'd. in the mean time Du-Vergy,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Adventurer, who enraged D'Eon almost to madness, &amp; has been in jail (for debt)
         eversince December last, having regain'd his liberty by the help (he says) of his
         countrymen declares upon oath, that he was sent from France with a half-promise of
         being declared Secretary to the Embassy, that he might <span style="font-style:italic">se servir de son epée,</span> if occasion were, against D'Eon, or at least urge him to do something, that might
         for ever disgrace him. he gives a detail of all his private conversations with G:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; others on this head. Mons: de G: is (I hear) much troubled, declares the whole
         a lye, but what is he to do? must he have another <span style="font-style:italic">Plaidoyer</span> in our Courts against this Scoundrel? and indeed from his own narrative he appears
         to be no better, tho' it is interlarded with fine French sentiment about justice &amp;
         virtue, &amp; honour, &amp; such like.
      </p>
      <p>I had prepared a finer period than the other to finish with, but d – mn it! I have
         somehow mislaid it among my papers.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you shall certainly have it next summer. how can people subscribe such a devil of
         a name (I warrant) you call it a <span style="font-style:italic">christian</span>-name, to their letters as you do?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I always thought at times I had a small matter of aversion for you mechanically arising
         in me, &amp; doubtless this was the reason. fie, fie, put on a white satten-mantle, &amp;
         be carried to church again. however, I forgive you for your Rippon-history's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> sake. Adieu! I shall almost be glad to see you again.

            &amp; return'd me his thanks for my civilities to you. so never say any more on that head:
