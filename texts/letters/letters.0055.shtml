      <p>Thank God, I had a very good night's rest, and am sufficiently awake to answer your
         letter, tho' likely to be more dull, than you that write in your sleep: and indeed
         I do not believe, that you ever are so much asleep, but you can write to a relation,
         play a sober game at Picquet, keep up a tete á tete conversation, sell a bargain,
         or perform any of the little offices of life with tolerable spirit; certain I am,
         there are many people in the world, who in their top spirits are no better eveillés,
         than you are at four in the morning, reclined upon your pillow. <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I believe, I partly guess [what is] your hopeful branch; I fancy you may find the
         first letters of both somewhere between H &amp; T inclusive; if I interpret your hieroglyphs
         aright.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as to my journey to London, which you are so good as to press, alas! what can I do?
         if I come, it is for good &amp; all,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; I don't know how it is, I have a sort of reluctance to leave this place, unamiable
         as it may seem; 'tis true Cambridge is very ugly, she is very dirty, &amp; very dull;
         but I'm like a cabbage, where I'm stuck, I love to grow; you should pull me up sooner,
         than any one, but I shall be ne'er the better for transplanting: poor Mr Cornwallis<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is here, sadly alter'd, so that one can very hardly know him; Towers<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> still stands out, &amp; refuses to admit him; so that they have called in their visitours,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that is the Vice-chancellour,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Dr Bently,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Dr Ashton;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but nothing is yet determined: the Assizes are just over, I was there; but I a'nt
         to be transported: Adieu,</p>
