					       </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I thank you for the second little letter, for your Cambridge-Anecdotes, &amp; (suffer me to say too) for the trouble you have had on
					my account. I am going to add to it by sending you my poetical Cargo to distribute, tho' whatever the Advertisement says, it will not be this fortnight yet. for you must know (what you will
					like no more, than I do; yet it was not in my power any how to avoid it) M<hi rend="super">r</hi> W:,
					who has set up a printing-press in his own house at Twickenham, earnestly desired, that he might print it for Dodsley, &amp; as there
					is but one hand employ'd, you must think it will take up some time to dispatch 2000 Copies, as soon as
					may be, you will have a parcel sent you. w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> you will dispose of, as follows. M<hi rend="super">rs</hi>
						Bonfoy,M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Bonfoy, D<hi rend="super">r</hi>
						Long, Gaskarth, &amp; all the Fellows resident, M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Montagu, &amp; Southwell (if they happen to be there) Master
					of S<hi rend="super">t</hi> Johns, (I know, he is at Rochester, but it suffices to send it to his
					lodge) Master of Bennet, M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Hurd, M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Balguy, M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Talbot, M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Nourse, M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Neville (of Jesus) M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Bickham, M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Hadley, M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Newcome. if you think, I forget any body, pray send it them in my name,
					what remain upon your hands, you will hide in a corner.</p>
				     <pb/>
				     <p>I am sorry to say I know no more of Mason, than you do. it is my own fault, I am afraid, for I have not yet answer'd that
						letter.</p>
				     <p>His Prussian Majesty wrote a letter to the K: owning himself in a bad situation, from w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> (he said) nothing but
					a <hi rend="underline">Coup de Maitre</hi> could extricate him. we have a secret expedition going forward: all I know is that L<hi rend="super">d</hi> Ancram, S<hi rend="super">r</hi> John Mordaunt, &amp; Gen:<hi rend="super">l</hi> Conway are to bear a part in it. the Duke has been very ill with his leg;
						Ranby was sent for, but countermanded; the Mar:<hi rend="super">l</hi> d'Etr√©es having sent him his own Surgeons. I would wish to be like M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Bonfoy, &amp; think that every thing turns out the best in the world, but it won't do. I am stupid &amp;
					low-spirited, but ever </p>
