      <p>A little journey I have been making to Arbroth has been the cause, that I did not
         answer your very obliging letter so soon as I ought to have done. a Man of merit,
         that honours me with his esteem &amp; has the frankness to tell me so, doubtless can need
         no excuses: his apology is made, &amp; we are already acquainted, however distant from
         each other.
      </p>
      <p>I fear, I can not (as I would wish) do myself the pleasure of waiting on you at Aberdeen,
         being under an engagement to go tomorrow to Taymouth, &amp; if the weather will allow
         it, to the Blair of Athol: this will take up four or five days, &amp; at my return the
         approach of winter will scarce permit me to think of any farther expeditions northwards.
         my stay here will however be a fortnight or three weeks longer, &amp; if in that time
         any business or invitation should call you this way, Ld Strathmore gives me commission
         to say, he shall be extremely glad to see you at Glames: &amp; doubt not, it will be a
         particular satisfaction to me to receive &amp; thank you in person for the favourable
         sentiments you have entertain'd of me, &amp; the civilities, with which you have honour'd
         me.
