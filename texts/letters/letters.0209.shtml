         <div class="salute">Dear Mason,</div>
      </div>
      <p>It is but a few days, since I was inform'd by Avison, that the alarm you had on your
         sister's account served but to prepare you for a greater Loss, wch was soon to follow.
         I know, what it is to lose a Person, that one's eyes &amp; heart have long been used to,
         &amp; I never desire to part with the remembrance of that loss, nor would wish you should.
         it is something, that you had a little time to acquaint yourself with the Idea beforehand
         (if I am inform'd right) &amp; that He probably suffer'd but little pain, the only thing
         that makes death terrible.
      </p>
      <p>It will now no longer be proper for me to see you at Hull as I should otherwise have
         tried to do. I shall go therefore to York with intention to make use of the Stage-Coach
         either on Friday or Monday. I shall be a week at Cambridge, &amp; then pass thro' London
         into Buckinghamshire. if I can be of any use to you in any thing it will give me great
         pleasure. let me have a line from you soon, for I am very affectionately
      </p>
