      <p>I (tho' I say it) had too much modesty to venture answering your dear, diverting Letter,
         in the Poetical Strain myself: but, when I was last at the DEVIL,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> meeting by chance with the deceased Mr Dennis<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there, he offer'd his Service, &amp;, being tip'd with a Tester, wrought, what followsâ&#x80;&#x93;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>

         <p>From purling Streams &amp; the Elysian Scene, <br /> From Groves, that smile with never-fading Green <br /> I reascend; in Atropos' despight <br /> Restored to Celadon,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; upper light:<br /> Ye gods, that sway the Regions under ground, <br /> Reveal to mortal View your realms profound; <br /> At his command admit the eye of Day; <br /> When Celadon commands, what God can disobey? <br /> Nor seeks he your Tartarean fires to know, <br /> The house of Torture, &amp; th' Abyss of Woe; <br /> But happy fields<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Mansions free from Pain,<br /> Gay Meads, &amp; springing flowers best please ye gentle Swain:</p> 
         <p>That little, naked, melancholy thing <br /> My Soul,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when first she tryed her flight to wing; <br />Began with speed new Regions to explore, <br /> And blunder'd thro' a narrow Postern door; <br /> First most devoutly having said its Prayers, <br /> It tumbled down a thousand pair of [Stairs],<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> Thro' Entries long, thro' Cellars vast &amp; deep, <br /> Where ghostly Rats their habitations keep, <br /> Where Spiders spread their Webs, &amp; owlish Goblins sleep. <br /> After so many Chances had befell, <br /> It came into a mead of Asphodel: <br /> Betwixt the Confines of ye light &amp; dark <br /> It lies, of 'Lyzium ye St James's park: <br /> Here Spirit-Beaux flutter along the Mall, <br /> And shadows in disguise scate o'er ye Iced Canal: <br /> Here groves embower'd, &amp; more sequester'd Shades, <br /> Frequented by ye Ghosts of Ancient Maids, <br /> Are seen to rise: the melancholy Scene <br /> With gloomy haunts, &amp; twilight walks between<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> Conceals the wayward band: here spend their time <br /> Greensickness Girls, that died in youthful prime, <br /> Virgins forlorn, all drest in Willow-green-i <br /> With Queen Elizabeth and Nicolini.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p> 
         <p>More to reveal, or many words to use <br /> Would tire alike your patience &amp; my muse. <br /> Believe, that never was so faithful found <br /> Queen Proserpine to Pluto under ground, <br /> Or Cleopatra to her Marc-Antony <br /> As Orozmades<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to his Celadony.</p>
