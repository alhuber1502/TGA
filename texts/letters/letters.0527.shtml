      <p>To your friendly accusation, I am glad I can plead not guilty with a safe conscience.
         Dodsley told me in the spring that the plates from Mr. Bentley's designs were worn
         out,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and he wanted to have them copied and reduced to a smaller scale for a new edition.
         I dissuaded him from so silly an expense, and desired he would put in no ornaments
         at all. The <span style="font-style:italic">Long Story</span> was to be totally omitted, as its only use (that of explaining the prints) was gone:
         but to supply the place of it in bulk, lest <span style="font-style:italic">my works</span> should be mistaken for the works of a flea, or a pismire, I promised to send him
         an equal weight of poetry or prose: so, since my return hither, I put up about two
         ounces of stuff; viz. The Fatal Sisters, The Descent of Odin (of both which you have
         copies),<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a bit of something from the Welch, and certain little notes, partly from justice
         (to acknowledge the debt, where I had borrowed any thing), partly from ill temper,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> just to tell the gentle reader, that Edward I. was not Oliver Cromwell, nor queen
         Elizabeth the witch of Endor.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> This is literally all; and with all this I shall be but a shrimp of an author. I
         gave leave also to print the same thing at Glasgow;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but I doubt my packet has miscarried, for I hear nothing of its arrival as yet. To
         what you say to me so civilly, that I ought to write more, I reply in your own words
         (like the pamphleteer,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who is going to confute you out of your own mouth), What has one to do, when <span style="font-style:italic">turned of fifty,</span> but really to think of finishing? However, I will be candid (for you seem to be so
         with me), and avow to you, that till fourscore-and-ten, whenever the humour takes
         me, I will write, because I like it; and because I like myself better when I do so.
         If I do not write much, it is because I cannot.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> As you have not this last plea, I see no reason why you should not continue as long
         as it is agreeable to yourself, and to all such as have any curiosity of judgment
         in the subjects you choose to treat. By the way let me tell you (while it is fresh)
         that lord Sandwich, who was lately dining at Cambridge, speaking (as I am told) handsomely
         of your book, said, it was pity you did not know that his cousin Manchester<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> had a genealogy of the kings, which came down no lower than to Richard III. and at
         the end of it were two portraits of Richard and his son, in which that king appeared
         to be a handsome man. I tell you it as I heard it: perhaps you may think it worth
         enquiring into.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I have looked into Speed and Leslie.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> It appears very odd, that Speed in the speech he makes for P. Warbeck, addressed
         to James IV. of Scotland, should three times cite the <span style="font-style:italic">manuscript proclamation</span> of Perkin, then in the hands of Sir Robert Cotton;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and yet when he gives us the proclamation afterwards (on occasion of the insurrection
         in Cornwall) he does not cite any such manuscript. In Casley's Catalogue of the Cotton
         Library<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you may see whether this manuscript proclamation still exists or not: if it does,
         it may be found at the Musæum. Leslie will give you no satisfaction at all: though
         no subject of England, he could not write freely on this matter, as the title of Mary
         his mistress to the crown of England was derived from that of Henry VII. Accordingly,
         he every where treats Perkin as an impostor; yet drops several little expressions
         inconsistent with that supposition. He has preserved no proclamation: he only puts
         a short speech into Perkin's mouth, the substance of which is taken by Speed, and
         translated in the end of his, which is a good deal longer: the whole matter is treated
         by Leslie very concisely and superficially. I can easily transcribe it, if you please;
         but I do not see that it could answer any purpose.</p>
      <p>Mr. Boswell's book I was going to recommend to you, when I received your letter: it
         has pleased and moved me strangely, all (I mean) that relates to Paoli. He is a man
         born two thousand years after his time! The pamphlet proves what I have always maintained,
         that any fool may write a most valuable book by chance, if he will only tell us what
         he heard and saw with veracity. Of Mr. Boswell's truth I have not the least suspicion,
         because I am sure he could invent nothing of this kind.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> The true title of this part of his work is, A Dialogue between a Greengoose and a
         Hero.</p>
      <p>I had been told of a manuscript in Benet-library: the inscription of it is <span style="font-style:italic">Itinerarium Fratris Simonis Simeonis</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <span style="font-style:italic">et Hugonis Illuminatoris,</span> 1322. Would not one think this should promise something? They were two Franciscan
         friars that came from Ireland, and passed through Wales to London, to Canterbury,
         to Dover, and so to France in their way to Jerusalem. All that relates to our own
         country has been transcribed for me, and (sorry am I to say) signifies not a halfpenny:
         only this little bit might be inserted in your next edition of the Painters:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Ad aliud caput civitatis (Londoniæ) est monasterium nigrorum monachorum nomine Westmonasterium,
         in quo constanter et communiter omnes reges Angliæ sepeliuntur—et eidem monasterio
         quasi immediatè conjungitur illud famosissimum palatium regis, in quo est illa vulgata
         camera, in cujus parietibus sunt omnes historiæ bellicæ totius Bibliæ ineffabiliter
         depictæ, atque in Gallico completissimè et perfectissimè conscriptæ, in non modicâ
         intuentium admiratione et maximâ regali magnificentiâ.</p>
      <p>I have had certain observations on your Royal and Noble Authors given me to send you
         perhaps about three years ago: last week I found them in a drawer, and (my conscience
         being troubled) now enclose them to you. I have even forgot whose they are. </p>
      <p>I have been also told of a passage in Ph. de Comines, which (if you know) ought not
         to have been passed over. The book is not at hand at present, and I must conclude
         my letter.</p>
