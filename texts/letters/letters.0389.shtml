         <div class="salute">Dear Mr Gray.</div>
      </div>
      <p>The Old Man was really dying when I wrote to you from Stilton.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> But in spite of all his old Complaints in spite of an added feaver and fistula, He
         still holds out, has had strength to undergo two Operations, and is in hopes of a
         perfect recovery. However, if he ever does die I am now secure of succeeding him,
         &amp; I find the Object of much more importance than I at first thought, for one Year
         with another by fines &amp;c the Preferment is good Â£230 per Annum:</p>
      <p>The Coronation &amp;c prevents Lady Holdernesse from coming into the North. But I am to
         meet His Lordship at Doncaster the Day after to morrow &amp; proceed with him to Aske<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Hornby.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> He will stay in the Country only 8 Weeks,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; I shall follow him to Town three Weeks after, as My waiting falls in the Coronation
         month. I wish you would write me an Epithalamic Sermon, It could not fail but get
         me a Mitre next in goodness to Squires.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>This letter is merely to tell you My Motions and to beg youll write to me, under His
         Lordships cover to Aske near Richmond. I was at Chatsworth last week, and had the
         pleasure to find Lord John<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> perfectly recoverd. My Love to Mr Brown</p>
