         <p>As one ought to be particularly careful to avoid blunders in a compliment of condolence, it would be a sensible satisfaction to me
					(before I testify my sorrow, and the sincere part I take in your misfortune) to know for certain, who it is I lament. I knew Zara and
						Selima, (Selima, was it? or Fatima) or rather I knew them both together; for I cannot justly say
					which was which. Then as to your handsome Cat, the name you distinguish her by, I am no less at a loss, as well knowing one's handsome
					cat is always the cat one likes best; or, if one be alive and the other dead, it is usually the latter that is the handsomest. Besides,
					if the point were never so clear, I hope you do not think me so ill-bred or so imprudent as to forfeit all my interest in the surviver:
					Oh no! I would rather seem to mistake, and imagine to be sure it must be the tabby one that had met with this sad accident. Till this
					affair is a little better determined, you will excuse me if I do not begin to cry:</p>
         <q>
            <p>'Tempus inane peto, requiem, spatiumque doloris.'
					</p>
         </q>
         <p>Which interval is the more convenient, as it gives time to rejoice with you on your new honors.
					This is only a beginning; I reckon next week we shall hear you are a Free-Mason, or a Gormogon at
					least.</p>
