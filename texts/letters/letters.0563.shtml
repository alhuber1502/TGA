      </div>
      <p>I set out on the 29th September, with poor Doctor Wharton, and lay at Brough,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but he was seized with a fit of the asthma the same night, and obliged in the morning
         to return home. I went by Penrith to Keswick, and passed six days there lap'd in Elysium;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> then came slowly by Ambleside to Kendal, and this day arrived here. I now am projecting
         to strike across the hills into Yorkshire, by Settle, and so get to Mason's; then,
         after a few days, I shall move gently towards Cambridge.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> The weather has favoured all my motions just as I could wish.
      </p>
      <p>I received your letter of 23 Sept.; was glad you deviated a little from the common
         track, and rejoiced you got well and safe home. 
      </p>
