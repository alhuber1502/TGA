         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I beleive you are quite right, as you always are in these matters. But it is a little
         hard upon my no-reading, to beleive I have not read Keisler.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have I assure you, and he led me into the mistake. He has a Chapter on the notions
         the northern nations had of a future state. first of all he talks of the Metempsichosis
         wch every body allows Druidical (except Pelloutier.)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; then says 'Hi qui sine animarum transmigratione aliam post obitum vitam superesse
         statuebant, duplices primo animarum sedes faciebant. Alius enim status erat earum<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> ante CREPUSCULUM DEORUM alius post illud.' &amp; then goes on to describe His Hell &amp;
         his Valhalla. But Sr W. Temple set me right about the low date of these Ideas<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> before I recd yours. I have therefore laid aside the Ode, &amp; shall make no use of
         it at all, except perhaps the Image of the Armed Death wch is my own, &amp; neither Scaldic
         nor runic. &amp; as to this nasty German Keisler who led me to take all this trouble,
         Ill never open him again. The fool was a fellow of the Royal Society what could one
         expect better from him.</p>
      <p>But after all, I do wish indeed that these Odes were all of them finishd, &amp; yet by
         what you talk of Measure &amp; Rhythm &amp; expression I think I shall never be able to finish
         them, never certainly at all if Im not to throw out my Ideas at large. So whether
         I am right or wrong I must have my way in that, Therefore talk no more about it. –
         Well you like my other Ode however – So Ill turn Wit, tho that, according to Popes
         gradation to <span style="font-style:italic">plain fool,</span> should have come before <span style="font-style:italic">Poetry.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> However as times go, tis well, it comes any how. But hold, I cannot part with Poetry
         till it has servd me a few friendly turns, &amp; when it has done that it may go to Fobus
         if it pleases, or to the Devil. One of these friendly turns it has done already &amp;
         you will have it<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> enclosed if my excellent Fraser<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> transcribes it in Time. Let me have your Strictures speedily, because I want to send
         it to Wood.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> take notice the lines descriptive of his Garden are strictly <span style="font-style:italic">peculiar,</span> &amp; Whitehead<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who has seen the place tells me they are the very thing, nothing can be conceivd
         so flowry so fragrant &amp; so Shady as the foreground nothing more extensive &amp; riant
         than the Offskip.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Yet I can't let this elegy come to you without begging that as you are stout you will
         be merciful to it, for I feel for it somehow as if it was a favrite Child, and I will
         give you a Hundred Druidical Odes, to burn in your Critical Colossus, if youll let
         it live. Lord! I know nothing of Dupps<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> being made Chancellor of the exchequer unless its a thing of course after hes made
         recorder of Cambridge, sure you had your intelligence from Mr Alderman Marshall.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Dont beleive a Word what the papers tell you, that the Childs name was Mary, twas
         Concubinage,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Dr Shebbeare<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is to teach it its Catechize.</p>
      <p>Pray Mr Gray! why wont you make your Muse do now and then a friendly turn? An Idle
         Slut as she is! If she was to throw out her Ideas never so carelessly it would satisfy
         some folks that I know, but I wont name names, &amp; therefore I wont sign all the nonsence
         I have written. </p>

         <p>Do you know if Pelloutier ever publishd a third volume<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of His Histoire des Celtes. Dr W<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has only sent me two, &amp; I find the third was to contain their ceremonials wch is
            all I want.</p>
         <p>Pray direct me to the passage, I have seen somewhere, like this Est Genus Hominum
