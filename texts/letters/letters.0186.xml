				     <p>You have probably before now met with the Paper I enclose, itself; tho' when you wrote last, you
					had only heard of it from others. it must not be known on any account, that it came from me, for by that means it might easily be
					discover'd, whom I had it from, wch might be the Ruin of a Gentleman. I do not see any one End it can answer, but that of putting Mr C:
					in a silly Light to such, as do not know him. the Exactness of Dates, Hours, &amp; Minutes with the Observation of his different Tones
					of Voice, betray it to be the Work of a Listener, placed on purpose. I am told, that old H: does not
					deny his Design of getting her for D: W:, after my Ld O: had refused her. he insists he was not once
					at C:rs Chambers, while she was in his Hands, &amp; that the Story of the 10,000Â£ is a manifest Lye.
					he affects to treat it as a Fact asserted by Mr C:, tho' no such thing appears, even in the Paper itself. I can't find for certain,
					that Et: (tho he has been here a second time with his Budget) has given any Copies of this Paper
					about, yet I do not doubt but He has. this I know; he has shew'd your Letter to him, &amp; his own Answers to a few People here, tho' I
					have not seen them. I am in hast, but shall write again soon. pray tell me, as soon as you receive this.</p>
