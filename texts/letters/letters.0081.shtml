      <p>It is now almost five weeks since I left Dijon, one of the gayest and most agreeable
         little cities of France, for Lyons, its reverse in all these particulars. It is the
         second in the kingdom in bigness and rank, the streets excessively narrow and nasty;
         the houses immensely high and large; (that, for instance, where we are lodged, has
         twenty-five rooms on a floor, and that for five stories) it swarms with inhabitants
         like Paris itself, but chiefly a mercantile people, too much given up to commerce,
         to think of their own, much less of a stranger's diversions. We have no acquaintance
         in the town, but such English as happen to be passing through here, in their way to
         Italy and the South, which at present happen to be near thirty in number. It is a
         fortnight since we set out from hence upon a little excursion to Geneva. We took the
         longest road, which lies through Savoy, on purpose to see a famous monastery, called
         the grand Chartreuse,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and had no reason to think our time lost. After having travelled [two]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> days very slow (for we did not change horses, it being impossible for a chaise to
         go post in these roads) we arrived at a little village, among the mountains of Savoy,
         called Echelles; from thence we proceeded on horses, who are used to the way, to the
         mountain of the Chartreuse: It is six miles to the top; the road runs winding up it,
         commonly not six feet broad; on one hand is the rock, with woods of pine-trees hanging
         over head; on the other, a monstrous precipice, almost perpendicular, at the bottom
         of which rolls a torrent, that sometimes tumbling among the fragments of stone that
         have fallen from on high, and sometimes precipitating itself down vast descents with
         a noise like thunder, which is still made greater by the echo from the mountains on
         each side, concurs to form one of the most solemn, the most romantic, and the most
         astonishing scenes I ever beheld: Add to this the strange views made by the craggs
         and cliffs on the other hand; the cascades that in many places throw themselves from
         the very summit down into the vale, and the river below; and many other particulars
         impossible to describe; you will conclude we had no occasion to repent our pains.
         This place St. Bruno chose to retire to, and upon its very top founded the aforesaid
         Convent, which is the superior of the whole order. When we came there, the two fathers,
         who are commissioned to entertain strangers, (for the rest must neither speak one
         to another, nor to any one else) received us very kindly; and set before us a repast
         of dried fish, eggs, butter, and fruits, all excellent in their kind, and extremely
         neat. They pressed us to spend the night there, and to stay some days with them; but
         this we could not do, so they led us about their house, which is, you must think,
         like a little city; for there are 100 fathers, besides 300 servants, that make their
         clothes, grind their corn, press their wine, and do every thing among themselves:
         The whole is quite orderly and simple; nothing of finery, but the wonderful decency,
         and the strange situation, more than supply the place of it. In the evening we descended
         by the same way, passing through many clouds that were then forming themselves on
         the mountain's side. Next day we continued our journey by Chamberry, which, though
         the chief city of the Dutchy, and residence of the king of Sardinia,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when he comes into this part of his dominions, makes but a very mean and insignificant
         appearance; we lay at Aix, once famous for its hot baths, and the next night at Annecy;
         the day after, by noon, we got to Geneva. I have not time to say any thing about it,
         nor of our solitary journey back again. [...]</p>
