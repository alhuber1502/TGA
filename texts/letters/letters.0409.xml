				     <p>I return you my best thanks for the copy of your book, which you sent me, and have not at all
					lessened my opinion of it since I read it in print, though the press has in general a bad effect on the complection of one's works. The engravings look, as you say, better than I had
					expected, yet not altogether so well as I could wish. I rejoice in the good dispositions of our court, and in the propriety of their
					application to you: the work is a thing so much to be wished; has so near a connection with the turn of your studies and of your
					curiosity; and might find such ample materials among your hoards and in your head; that it will be a sin if you let it drop and come to
					nothing, or worse than nothing, for want of your assistance. The historical part should be in the manner of Henault, a mere abridgement, a series of facts selected with judgment, that may serve as a clue to lead the mind
					along in the midst of those ruins and scattered monuments of art, that time has spared. This would be
					sufficient, and better than Montfaucon's more diffuse narrative. Such a work (I have heard) Mr.
						Burke is now employed about, which though not intended for this purpose might be applied perhaps to
					this use. Then at the end of each reign should come a dissertation explanatory of the plates, and pointing out the turn of thought, the
					customs, ceremonials, arms, dresses, luxury, and private life, with the improvement or decline of the arts during that period. This you
					must do yourself, beside taking upon you the superintendence, direction, and choice of materials. As to the expence, that must be the
					king's own entirely, and he must give the book to foreign ministers and people of note; for it is obvious no private man can undertake
					such a thing without a subscription, and no gentleman will care for such an expedient; and a gentleman it should be, because he must
					have easy access to archives, cabinets, and collections of all sorts. I protest I do not think it impossible but they may give into
					such a scheme: they approve the design, they wish to encourage the arts and to be magnificent, and they have no Versailles or
						Herculaneum.
				</p>
				     <p>I hope to see you toward the end of March. If you bestow a line on me, pray tell me whether the baronne de la Peyriere is gone to her castle of Viry; and whether Fingal be discovered or
					shrewdly suspected to be a forgery.</p>
