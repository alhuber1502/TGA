         <div class="salute">My Dear Wharton</div>
      </div>
      <p>I promised Dr Keene<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> long since to give you an Account of our Magnificences here,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but the News-Papers &amp; he himself in Person have got the Start of my Indolence, so
         that by this Time you are well acquainted with all the Events, that adorned that Week
         of Wonders. thus much I may venture to tell you, because it is probable no body else
         has done it, that our Friend Chappy's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Zeal &amp; Eloquence surpassed all Power of Description. Vesuvio in an Eruption was not
         more violent than his Utterance, nor (since I am at my Mountains) Pelion with all
         its Pine-trees in a Storm of Wind more impetuous than his Action. and yet the Senate-house
         still stands, &amp; (I thank God) we are all safe and well at your Service. I was ready
         to sink for him, &amp; scarce dared to look about me, when I was sure it was all over:
         but soon found I might have spared my Confusion, for all People join'd to applaud
         him: every thing was quite right; &amp; I dare swear, not three People here but think
         him a Model of Oratory. for all the Duke's little Court came with a Resolution to
         be pleased; &amp; when the Tone was once given the University, who ever wait for the Judgement
         of their Betters, struck into it with an admirable Harmony. for the rest of the Performances
         they were (as usual) very ordinary. every one, while it lasted, was very gay, &amp; very
         busy in the Morning, &amp; very owlish &amp; very tipsy at Night. I make no Exceptions from
         the Chancellour to Blew-Coat.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mason's Ode<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was the only Entertainment, that had any tolerable Elegance; &amp; for my own Part I
         think it (with some little abatements) uncommonly well on such an Occasion. pray let
         me know your Sentiments, for doubtless you have seen it. the Author of it grows apace
         into my good Graces, as I know him more: he is very ingenious with great Good-Nature
         &amp; Simplicity. a little vain, but in so harmless &amp; so comical a Way, that it does not
         offend one at all; a little ambitious, but withall so ignorant in the World &amp; its
         Ways, that this does not hurt him in one's Opinion. so sincere &amp; so undisguised, that
         no Mind with a Spark of Generosity would ever think of hurting him, he lies so open
         to Injury. but so indolent, that if he can not overcome this Habit, all his good Qualities
         will signify nothing at all. after all I like him so well, I could wish you knew him.
      </p>
      <p>[Tuthill],<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who was here at the Installation &amp; in high Spirits, will come to settle in Cambridge
         at Michaelmas. and I have hopes, that these two with Brown's assistance may bring
         Pembroke into some Esteem: but then there is no making Bricks without Straw. they
         have no Boys at all,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; unless you can send us a Hamper or two out of the North to begin with, they will
         be like a few Rats straggling about an old deserted Mansion-House.
      </p>
      <p>I should be glad (as you will see Keene often<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> ) if you could throw in a Word, as of your own head merely, about a Fellowship for
         Stonhewer. he has several times mention'd it himself, as a Thing he would try to bring
         about either at Queen's or Christ's, where he has interest: but I know not how, it
         has gone off again, &amp; we have heard no more lately about it. I know it is not practicable
         here at Peter-house, because of his County;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; tho' at Pembroke we might possibly get a Majority, yet Roger<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is an animal, that might play over again all his old Game, &amp; with a better appearance
         than before. you would therefore oblige me, if you would sound him upon this subject,
         for it is Stonhewer's Wish, &amp; (I think) would be an Advantage to him, if he had a
         Reason for continuing here some time longer. if you can get Keene to be explicit about
         it (but it must seem to be a Thought entirely of your own) I will desire you to let
         me know the Result. my best Wishes, Dear Sr, ever attend on you, &amp; Mrs Wharton. I
         am most sincerely &amp; unalterably
      </p>
