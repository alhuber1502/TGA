      </div>
      <p>In my way into the remote parts of the North I mean to make you a visit at York. probably
         you will see me there on Wednesday next in the evening. it is your business to consider,
         whether you have a house &amp; a bed for me, for I shall stay there a week perhaps, if
         you continue agreeable so long. I have been in Town this month, every day teeming
         with prodigies. I suppose you receive expresses every three hours, &amp; therefore I pass
         over the Regency-bill, the Weaver's petition, the siege of Bedford-House, the riot
         on Ludgate-Hill, the royal embassy to Hayes, the Carte-Blanche refused with disdain,
         the subversion of the Ministry, wch fights to the last gasp, &amp; afterwards, like the
         Man, <span style="font-style:italic">che combattea, ed era morto,</span>  &amp; yet stands upon its legs, &amp; spits in its Master's face to this day, because no
         body will deign to take its place; the House of Commons standing at gaze with its
         hands before it; the House of Lords bullying the Justices of Peace, and fining the
         Printers; the King —— &amp;c: &amp;c: o o the rest is left to oral tradition.
