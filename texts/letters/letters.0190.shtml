      <p>I am at present at Stoke, to wch I came at half an Hour's Warning upon the News I
         received of my Mother's Illness, &amp; did not expect to have found her alive: but as
         I found her much better, &amp; she continues so, I shall be very glad to make you a Visit
         at Strawberry, whenever you give me Notice of a convenient time. I am surprized at
         the Print,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch far surpasses my Idea of London Graving. the Drawing itself was so finished,
         that I suppose, it did not require all the Art I had imagined to copy it tolerably.
         my Aunts<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> just now, seeing me open your Letter, take it to be a Burying-Ticket enclosed, &amp;
         ask, whether any body has left me a Ring? and so they still conceive it to be, even
         with all their Spectacles on. heaven forbid they should suspect it to belong to any
         Verses of mine; they would burn me for a Poet. Mr Bentley (I believe) will catch a
         better Idea of Stoke-House from any old Barn he sees, than from my Sketch: but I will
         try my Skill. I forbid no Banes; but am satisfied, if your Design succeed so well
         as you intend it. and yet I know, it will be accompanied with something not at all
         agreeable to me.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
