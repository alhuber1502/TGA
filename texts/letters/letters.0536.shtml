         <div class="salute">Dear Mary, </div>
      </div>
      <p>I thank you for all your intelligence (and the first news I had of poor Brocket's
         death was from you) and to reward you in part for it, I now shall tell you, that this
         day, hot as it is, I kissed the King's hand; that my warrant was signed by him last
         night; that on Wednesday I received a very honourable letter from the D. of Grafton,
         acquainting me that his majesty had ordered him to offer me this Professorship, and
         much more, which does me too much credit by half for me to mention it. The Duke adds,
         <span style="font-style:italic">that from private as well as public considerations, he takes the warmest part in approving
            this measure of the King's.</span> These are his own words. You see there are princes (or ministers) left in the world,
         that know how to do things handsomely; for I profess I never asked for it, nor have
         I seen his Grace before or after this event.
      </p>
      <p>Dr. R. (not forgetting a certain lady of his) is so good to you, and to me, that you
         may (if you please) show him my letter. He will not be critical as to the style, and
         I wish you would send it also to Mr. Brown, for I have not time to write to him by
         this day's post; they need not mention this circumstance to others, they may learn
         it as they can. Adieu!
      </p>
      <p>I receive your letter of July 28 (while I am writing), consult your friends over the
         way, they are as good as I, and better. All I can say is, the Board have been so often
         used to the name of Antrobus lately, that I fear they may take your petition not in
         good part. If you are sure of the kindness or interest of Mr. A. the opportunity should
         not be lost; but I always a little distrust new friends and new lawyers.
      </p>
      <p>I have found a man, who has brought Mr. Eyres (I think) up to my price, in a hurry;
         however he defers his final answer till Wednesday next. He shall not have it a shilling
         lower, I promise; and if he hesitates, I will rise upon him like a fury. Good-night.
         I am ever yours.
      </p>
      <p>How could you dream that St: or Hinchl: would ask this for themselves? The only people
         that ask'd it were Lort, Marriott, Delaval, Jebb, and Peckâ€“, at least I have heard
         of no more. Delaval always communicated his thoughts to me, knowing I would make no
         ill use of that knowledge. Lort is a worthy man, and I wish he could have it, or something
         as good: the rest are nothing.
      </p>
