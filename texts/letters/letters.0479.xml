					       <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I rejoice to find you are both in health, &amp; that one or other of you at least can have your teeming-time. you are wise as a serpent, but the devil of a dove, in timing both your satire, &amp; your
						compliment. when a Man stands on the very verge of Legislation with
					all his <hi rend="italic">unblushing</hi> honours thick upon him; when the Gout has nip'd him in the bud, &amp; blasted all his hopes
					at least for one winter: then come you buzzing about his nose, &amp; strike your sting deep into the reddest angriest part of his toe,
					wch will surely mortify. when another has been weak enough in the plenitude of power to disarm himself
					of his popularity; &amp; to conciliate a Court, that naturally hates him, submits to be deck'd in their trappings, &amp; fondle their
					lap-dogs: then come you to lull him with your gentlest hum, recalling his good deeds, &amp; <hi rend="italic">hoping</hi>
					 what I (with all my old partialities) scarce should dare to hope, if I had but any one else to put my
					trust in. let you alone, where <hi rend="italic">Spite</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Interest</hi> are in view!â€“ay, ay, Mrs M: (I
					see) will be a Bishopess.</p>
				     <p>Well, I transcribed your wickedness in a print-hand &amp; sent it by last Sunday's post to Dr G:
					with your orders about it, for I had heard St: say, that he hoped for a month's respite to go into the
					North, &amp; did not know, but he might be gone. G: was to send me word, he had received it, but has not yet done so, and (Lord bless
					me!) who knows, but he may be gone into Derbyshire, &amp; the Ode gone after him! if so, mind, I am
					innocent, &amp; meant for the best. I liked it vastly, &amp; thought it very well-turn'd &amp; easy, especially the <hi rend="italic">diabolical</hi>
					 part of it: I fear, it will not keep, &amp; would have wish'd the Publick might have eat it fresh:
					but if any untoward accident should delay it, it will be still better than most things, that appear at their table. </p>
				     <p>I shall finish, where you begun, with my apology. you say you have <hi rend="italic">neglected</hi> me, &amp; (to make it relish the
					better) <hi rend="italic">with many others.</hi> for my part I have not neglected you: but I have always consider'd the <hi rend="italic">Happy,</hi> that is, new-married People, as too sacred, or too profane, a thing to be approach'd by me: when the year is
					over, I have no longer any respect or aversion for them.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu! I am in no spirits, &amp; perplex'd besides with many little cares, but always sincerely<lb/> Yours </salute>
					       <signed>T G: </signed>
				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p>P:S: My best respects to Madam in her grogram gown. I have long since heard, that you were out of
						pain with regard to her health. Mr Brown is gone to see his Brother near Margate.</p>
