      <p>Sure You are not out of your Wits! this I know, if you suffer my Head to be printed,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you infallibly will put me out of mine. I conjure you immediately to put a stop to
         any such design. who is at the Expence of engraving it, I know not; but if it be Dodsley,
         I will make up the Loss to him. the thing, as it was, I know will make me ridiculous
         enough; but to appear in proper Person at the head of my works, consisting of half
         a dozen Ballads in 30 Pages, would be worse than the Pillory. I do assure you, if
         I had received such a Book with such a frontispice without any warning, I believe,
         it would have given me a Palsy. therefore I rejoice to have received this Notice;
         &amp; shall not be easy, till you tell me all thoughts of it are laid aside. I am extremely
         in earnest, &amp; can't bear even the Idea!
      </p>
      <p>I had wrote to Dodsley to tell him, how little I liked the Title he had prefix'd,
         but your letter has put all that out of my Head. if you think it necessary to print
         these Explanations<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for the use of People that have no eyes, I could be glad, they were a little alter'd.
         I am to my shame in your debt for a long letter, but I can not think of anything else,
         till you have set me at ease.
      </p>
