         <div class="salute">Dear Sir, </div>
      </div>
      <p>I will beg the favour of your Milton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> once more. I have considerd your Observations<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in the Paper you oblig'd me with yesterday. I think them excellent and shall correct
         accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>The only one of the least consequence that sticks with me is your hint about the Introduction.
         And I owe it to your frankness, to tell you my sincere sentiments. I hate the hypocrisy
         of those men who think to cover their own dullness under the mask of piety, as much
         as you can do. I know too what is to be said for those who have not devoted themselves
         to a Profession And still further for those who read the Poets, not for amusement
         only, but to contend with the best of them. I honour, in a word, true poetry and true
         Poets as much as any body. And I think, in particular, with you that M<span class="super">r</span> Pope's apologies for himself were very needless. Yet still in my own case I must
         profess to you with sincerity, that what I say in the Letter is my real opinion.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> The Profession, I am of, is a sacred one. And tho' it does not oblige me to renounce
         the poets, my business, I think, should lie elsewhere. I assure you, I take this design
         to be but a decent one in my circumstances, and, considering the circumstances of
         the time, an absolute Duty. So that when these things are out of my hands, and the
         few Dialogues I mention'd to you, I have determin'd long since to pass the remainder
         of my Life (I mean if in that remainder I do any thing as a writer) in the concerns
         of my own Profession. However there are some things in the Introduction put more strongly
         than they needed to have been, and these I shall soften; principally because what
         I leave will then be understood, not as words of course, but as my real meaning.
      </p>
      <p>You will think I treat you very formally, in entering into this serious explanation.
         I do it to show you on what grounds, and with what reluctance, I deny myself the use
         of any part of your kind Intimations to me.
      </p>
