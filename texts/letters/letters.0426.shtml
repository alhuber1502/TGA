         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>You may well wonder at my long taciturnity:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I wonder too, &amp; know not what cause to assign, for it is certain, I think of you
         daily. I believe, it is owing to the nothingness of my history, for except six weeks
         that I pass'd in Town towards the end of spring, &amp; a little jaunt to Epsom<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Box-Hill, I have been here time out of mind in a place, where no events grow, tho'
         we preserve those of former days by way of <span style="font-style:italic">Hortus Siccus</span> in our libraries. my slumbers were disturbed the other day by an unexpected visit
         from Mr. W: who dined with me, seem'd mighty happy for the time he stay'd, &amp; said
         he could like to live here:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but hurried home in the evening to his new Gallery,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch is all Gothicism, &amp; gold, &amp; crimson, &amp; looking-glass.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he has purchased at an auction in Suffolk ebony-chairs<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; old moveables enough to load a waggon.</p>
      <p>Mason &amp; I have received letters from Count Algarotti, Chambellan de sa Majeste le
         Roi de Prusse, with observations, (that is panegyricks) on our Tragedies &amp; our Odes,
         &amp; a present of certain Italian Dissertations, wch he has lately publish'd on the state
         of Painting and Musick. one of them is dedicated to Mr. Pitt, whom he styles – <span style="font-style:italic">Uomo immortale, e Restitutore d'Inghilterra, Amico del gran Federigo.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I was in Town, when Mr Middleton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> died, &amp; immediately got all the information I could (first from St:r &amp; then from
         your Brother) of the dispositions he had made. I suppose, they are as good as you
         expected, &amp; tho' the prospect is but small, that you should enjoy the benefit of them
         in your own person, yet that is not impossible; &amp; your Son (I think) stands a very
         good chance, wch can not chuse but open an agreeable prospect to you, in wch I take
         a part, &amp; congratulate you both upon it. I doubt you have not read Rousseau's <span style="font-style:italic">Emile</span>:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> every body that has children, should read it more than once, for tho' it abounds
         with his usual glorious absurdity, tho' his general scheme of education be an impracticable
         chimera: yet there are a thousand lights struck out, a thousand important truths better
         express'd than ever they were before, that may be of service to the wisest Man. particularly
         I think he has observed children with more attention &amp; knows their meaning &amp; the working
         of their little passions better than any other Writer. as to his religious discussions,
         wch have alarmed the world, &amp; engaged their thoughts more than any other part of his
         book, I set them all at nought, &amp; wish they had been omitted. Mrs Jonathan<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> told me, you begun your evening-prayer as soon as I was gone, &amp; that it had a great
         effect upon the congregation: I hope you have not grown weary of it, nor lay it aside,
         when company comes. poor Mrs. Bonfoy<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (who taught me to pray) is dead. she struggled near a week against the Iliac Passion
         (I fear) in great torture with all her senses about her, &amp; with much resolution took
         leave of her physician some days before she expired, &amp; would suffer no one to see
         her afterwards but common Servants.</p>
      <p>You describe Winston<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <span style="font-style:italic">con tanto amore,</span> that I take it amiss I was not suffer'd to see it, &amp; want to be buried there too.
         but enough of death! I have forgot to tell you that Dr. Long has had an audience of
         the K: &amp; Queen an hour long at Buckingham-House.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> his errand was to present them with a Lyricord<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (such a one!) of his own making, &amp; a glass-sphere: he had long been solliciting this
         honour, wch Ld Bute at last procured him, &amp; he is very happy. the K: told him, he
         bid fair for a century of life at least;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> ask'd him, whether he preach'd; why he did not write verses in the Cambridge Collection;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; what not? The Q. spoke French to him, &amp; ask'd, how he liked Handel?</p>
      <p>And I ask you, how you like the present times? whether you had not rather be a Printer's
         Devil, than a Secretary of State? you are to expect (I hear) a new Ministry,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> composed of the Earl of Shelburne,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Mr Rigby,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Duke &amp; Dutchess of Bedford,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Earl Gower,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp;c. which doubtless will give universal satisfaction. the great Ld Holland,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who is at Paris, being lately asked by a young Man, who was returning home, whether
         he had any commands in England, made no reply but by shrugging up his shoulders, &amp;
         fetching a deep sigh.</p>
      <p>I kept an exact account of Heat &amp; Cold in the Spring here: the sum &amp; substance of
         wch is, that (at 9 in the morning) on the 18th of January, the Therm: was at 31, &amp;
         the small birds were so tame you might take them up with your hand. this was the greatest
         cold. on the 15th of April it was at 58, &amp; the same afternoon at 65, wch was the greatest
         heat from Jan: 1 to May 1st. </p>
