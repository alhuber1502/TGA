      </div>
      <p>I paid the sum abovemention'd this morning at Gillam's Office in Bishopsgate-Street:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the remittance you will please to pay out of it. I have not time to add all the bad
         news of the times,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but in a few days you shall have some of it; tho' the worst of all is just what I
         can not write. I am perfectly out of humour, &amp; so will you be.</p>
      <p>Mason is here, &amp; has brought his Wife, a pretty, modest, innocent, interesting figure,
         looking like 18, tho' she is near 28. she does not speak, only whispers, &amp; her cough
         as troublesome as ever: yet I have great hopes, there is nothing consumptive. she
         is strong &amp; in good spirits. we were all at the Opera together on Saturday last.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> they desire their loves to you. I have seen Mr Talbot, &amp; Delaval lately.</p>
