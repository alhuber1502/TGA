      <p>It is indeed for want of spirits, as you suspect, that my studies lie among the Cathedrals,
         and the Tombs,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and the Ruins. To think, though to little purpose, has been the chief amusement of
         my days; and when I would not, or cannot think, I dream. At present I find myself
         able to write a Catalogue,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or to read the Peerage book, or Miller's Gardening Dictionary,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and am thankful that there are such employments and such authors in the world. Some
         people, who hold me cheap for this, are doing perhaps what is not half so well worth
         while. As to posterity, I may ask, (with some body<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whom I have forgot) what has it ever done to oblige me?
      </p>
      <p>To make a transition from myself to as poor a subject, the Tragedy of Agis;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I cry to think that it should be by the Author of Douglas: Why, it is all modern
         Greek; the story is an antique statue painted white and red, frized, and dressed in
         a neglig√©e made by a Yorkshire mantua-maker. Then here is the Miscellany<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (Mr Dodsley has sent me the whole set gilt and lettered, I thank him). Why, the two
         last volumes are worse than the four first; particularly Dr Akenside<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is in a deplorable way. What signifies Learning and the Antients, (Mason will say
         triumphantly) why should people read Greek to lose their imagination, their ear, and
         their mother tongue? But then there is Mr Shenstone,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who trusts to nature and simple sentiment, why does he do no better? he goes hopping
         along his own gravel-walks, and never deviates from the beaten paths for fear of being
         lost.
      </p>
      <p>I have read Dr Swift,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and am disappointed. There is nothing of the negotiations that I have not seen better
         in M. de Torcy<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> before. The manner is careless, and has little to distinguish it from common writers.
         I meet with nothing to please me but the spiteful characters of the opposite party
         and its leaders. I expected much more secret history.
