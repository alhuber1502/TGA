            <salute>Dear Sir </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I set out on the 29th September, with poor Doctor Wharton, and lay at Brough, but he was seized with
					a fit of the asthma the same night, and obliged in the morning to return home. I went by Penrith to Keswick, and passed six days there
					lap'd in Elysium; then came slowly by Ambleside to Kendal, and this day arrived here. I now am
					projecting to strike across the hills into Yorkshire, by Settle, and so get to Mason's; then, after a few days, I shall move gently
					towards Cambridge. The weather has favoured all my motions just as I could wish.</p>
         <p>I received your letter of 23 Sept.; was glad you deviated a little from the common track, and rejoiced you got well and safe home. </p>
         <closer>
            <salute>I am, ever yours </salute>
