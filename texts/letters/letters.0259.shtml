      <p>I have not been dead, but only gone to [Mr Chute who had been]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> seized with a cruel fit of the Gout, wch held him five weeks, &amp; as he had no other
         company in the house it was impossible to leave him in that condition. since my return
         I have made a visit of four days at Twickenham.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I shall probably stay here till the middle of next month<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; then transplant myself to London, if Mrs Wharton and You <span style="font-style:italic">de bon cÅ&#x93;ur</span> have no objection to me. if any thing has happen'd, since I saw you, to make it inconvenient
         I insist upon being told so. I have heard the story of the <span style="font-style:italic">Lyon,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; its consequences, tho' you say not a word about it. pray, inform me how Miss Peggy<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> got over her operation.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Leicester-house<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is (as I suppose you know) settling upon its own terms. 40,000Â£ a year for the P:,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> 5000 for P: E:d.,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> no removing to St. J:s,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Earl of Bute<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Groom of the Stole (there is for you) Mr Stone<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Controller of the [Household (wch see]ms<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a concession by way of thanks) Lords of the Bed Chamber I have forgot.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Miss Shepherd's Mr Ingram, &amp; Mr Onslow,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Speaker's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Son, Grooms of the Bed-chamber. are you upon the List?</p>
      <p>Shew me such another King, as the K: of Prussia.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> every body used to call him Coxcomb, &amp; to be sure he is one; but a Coxcomb (it is
         plain) may make a figure far superior to the ordinary run of Kings. I delight in his
         treatment of the K: of Poland.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> when he first inform'd him of the necessity he was under to make use of Saxony in
         his way to Bohemia, he added that if his Majesty chose to retire into his Polish Dominions
         he had order'd Relais on the road, &amp; that all the respect in the world should be shewn
         him.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; his last memorial to the Empress-Queen ended with <span style="font-style:italic">point de rÃ©ponse en stile d'Oracle.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I recommend two little French Books to you, one call'd Memoires de M:r De la Porte.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it has all the air of simplicity &amp; truth, &amp; contains some few very extraordinary
         facts, relating to Anne of Austria, &amp; Card:l Mazarin. the other is two small Volumes,
         Mem:es de Madame Staal.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the facts are no great matter, but the manner &amp; vivacity of it make it interesting.
         she was a sort of Confidente to the late Dutchess of Maine,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; imprison'd a long time in the Bastille on her account during the Regency. the first
         you may buy, &amp; the latter borrow. I desire my Compliments to Mrs Wharton, &amp; am,</p>
