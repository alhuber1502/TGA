         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>I was really far from well in health, when I received your last letter: since that
         I am come to Town, &amp; find myself considerably better. Mason has pass'd all the winter
         here with Stonhewer in Curson-Street, May-fair, but thinks of returning homeward in
         a week or ten days. he had your letter (wch had gone round by Aston) &amp; was applying
         to Mr Fraser<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; others for proper recommendations in case poor Mrs. E:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> should be obliged to make use of them: but now you have given us some hopes, that
         these expedients may not be necessary. I for my own part do heartily wish, you may
         not be deceived, &amp; that so cool a Tyrant as her Husband seems to be, may willingly
         give up the thoughts of exercising that tyranny, when it is most in his power: but,
         I own, it seems to me very unlikely. however I would not have you instrumental (but
         at her most earnest intreaty) in sending her out of his reach. no persuasion or advice
         on this head should come from you: it should be absolutely her own firm resolution
         (before sure witnesses) for that is the only thing, that can authorise you to assist
         her. it must have been her own fault (at least her weakness) that such a decision
         as that of these Delegates<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> could find any grounds to go upon. I do not wonder, that such an event has discomposed
         you: it discomposes me to think of the trouble &amp; expence it has brought on you!</p>
      <p>My summer was intended to have been pass'd in Switzerland: but I have drop'd the thought
         of it, &amp; believe my expeditions will terminate in Old-park: for travel I must, or
         cease to exist. till this year I hardly knew what (mechanical) low-spirits were: but
         now I even tremble at an east-wind. it is here the height of summer, but with all
         the bloom &amp; tender verdure of spring. at Cambridge the Laurustines &amp; Arbutus kill'd
         totally: Apricots, Almonds, &amp; Figs lost all their young shoots. St:r<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has had a melancholy journey: tomorrow we expect him here.</p>
