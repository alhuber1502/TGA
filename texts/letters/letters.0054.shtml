      <p>I did not allow myself time to rejoyce with Ashton upon his good fortune, till after
         I had ransacked all his informations, as to you; &amp; with him admired your judgement
         &amp; conduct; for these virtues (I find, you are resolved to shew us) you are as well
         acquainted with, as we knew you were with their Sisters: what! will no less than the
         whole family serve your turn; sure one of 'em might have contented any moderate stomach!
         there's Miss Temperance, Miss Constance &amp; the rest of 'em; e'er a one, i'gad, a match

         does it make after cutting for the simples? have you read yourself to sleep with Dr
         Swift's conversation, as I did? that confounded Lady Answerall, tho' she says less
         than any body, is the devil to me! pray did you ever see an elephant? I have. if you
         han't, you never saw an ugly thing. I would not be Aurengzebe for the world; they
         say, he rid upon one: that's
