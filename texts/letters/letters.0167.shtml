      <p>I was yesterday told, that Turner (the Professor of Modern History here) was dead
         in London.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if it be true; I conclude, it is now too late to begin asking for it: but we had
         (if you remember) some Conversation on that Head at Twickenham; &amp; as you have probably
         found some Opportunity to mention it to Mr W: since, I would gladly know his Thoughts
         about it. what he can do, he only can tell us: what he will do, if he can, is with
         me no Question. if he could find a proper Channel; I certainly might ask it with as
         much, or more Propriety, than any one in this Place. if any thing were done, it should
         be as private as possible; for if the People, who have any Sway here, could prevent
         it, I think they would most zealously. I am not sorry for writing you a little interested
         Letter: perhaps it is a Stratagem: the only one I had left, to provoke an Answer from
         you, &amp; revive our Ã¢&#x80;&#x93; Correspondence, shall I call it? there are many particulars
         relating to you, that have long interested me more than twenty Matters of this Sort,
         but you have had no Regard for my Curiosity: and yet it is something, that deserves
         a better Name! I don't so much as know your Direction, or that of Mr Whithed.</p>
