      <p>You do yourself and me justice, in imagining that you merit, and that I am capable
         of sincerity.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have not a thought, or even a weakness, I desire to conceal from you; and consequently
         on my side deserve to be treated with the same openness of heart. My vanity perhaps
         might make me more reserved towards you, if you were one of the heroic race, superior
         to all human failings; but as mutual wants are the ties of general society, so are
         mutual weaknesses of private friendships, supposing them mixt with some proportion
         of good qualities; for where one may not sometimes blame, one does not much care ever
         to praise. All this has the air of an introduction designed to soften a very harsh
         reproof that is to follow; but it is no such matter: I only meant to ask, Why did
         you change your lodging? Was the air bad, or the situation melancholy? If so, you
         are quite in the right. Only, is it not putting yourself a little out of the way of
         a people, with whom it seems necessary to keep up some sort of intercourse and conversation,
         though but little for your pleasure or entertainment, (yet there are, I believe, such
         among them as might give you both) at least for your information in that study, which,
         when I left you, you thought of applying to? for that there is a certain study necessary
         to be followed, if we mean to be of any use in the world, I take for granted; disagreeable
         enough (as most necessities are) but, I am afraid, unavoidable. Into how many branches
         these studies are divided in England, every body knows; and between that which you
         and I had pitched upon, and the other two, it was impossible to balance long. Examples
         shew one that it is not absolutely necessary to be a blockhead to succeed in this
         profession. The labour is long, and the elements dry and unentertaining; nor was ever
         any body (especially those that afterwards made a figure in it) amused, or even not
         disgusted in the beginning; yet, upon a further acquaintance, there is surely matter
         for curiosity and reflection. It is strange if, among all that huge mass of words,
         there be not somewhat intermixed for thought. Laws have been the result of long deliberation,
         and that not of dull men, but the contrary; and have so close a connexion with history,
         nay, with philosophy itself, that they must partake a little of what they are related
         to so nearly. Besides, tell me, Have you ever made the attempt? Was not you frighted
         merely with the distant prospect? Had the Gothic character and bulkiness of those
         volumes (a tenth part of which perhaps it will be no further necessary to consult,
         than as one does a dictionary) no ill effect upon your eye?</p>
      <p>Are you sure, if Coke<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> had been printed by Elzevir, and bound in twenty neat pocket volumes, instead of
         one folio, you should never have taken him up for an hour, as you would a Tully, or
         drank your tea over him? I know how great an obstacle ill spirits are to resolution.
         Do you really think, if you rid ten miles every morning, in a week's time you should
         not entertain much stronger hopes of the Chancellorship, and think it a much more
         probable thing than you do at present? The advantages you mention are not nothing;
         our inclinations are more than we imagine in our own power; reason and resolution
         determine them, and support under many difficulties. To me there hardly appears to
         be any medium between a public life and a private one; he who prefers the first, must
         put himself in a way of being serviceable to the rest of mankind, if he has a mind
         to be of any consequence among them: Nay, he must not refuse being in a certain degree
         even dependent upon some men who already are so. If he has the good fortune to light
         on such as will make no ill use of his humility, there is no shame in this: If not,
         his ambition ought to give place to a reasonable pride, and he should apply to the
         cultivation of his own mind those abilities which he has not been permitted to use
         for others' service. Such a private happiness (supposing a small competence of fortune)
         is almost always in every one's power, and the proper enjoyment of age, as the other
         is the employment of youth. You are yet young, have some advantages and opportunities,
         and an undoubted capacity, which you have never yet put to the trial. Set apart a
         few hours, see how the first year will agree with you, at the end of it you are still
         the master; if you change your mind, you will only have got the knowledge of a little
         somewhat that can do no hurt, or give you cause of repentance. If your inclination
         be not fixed upon any thing else, it is a symptom that you are not absolutely determined
         against this, and warns you not to mistake mere indolence for inability. I am sensible
         there is nothing stronger against what I would persuade you to, than my own practice;
         which may make you imagine I think not as I speak. Alas! it is not so; but I do not
         act what I think, and I had rather be the object of your pity, than you should be
         that of mine; and, be assured, the advantage I may receive from it, does not diminish
         my concern in hearing you want somebody to converse with freely, whose advice might
         be of more weight, and always at hand. We have some time since come to the southern
         period of our voyages; we spent about nine days at Naples. It is the largest and most
         populous city, as its environs are the most deliciously fertile country, of all Italy.
         We sailed in the bay of BaiÃ¦, sweated in the Solfatara, and died in the grotta del
         Cane, as all strangers do; saw the Corpus Christi procession, and the King and the
         Queen,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and the city underground,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (which is a wonder I reserve to tell you of another time) and so returned to Rome
         for another fortnight; left it (left Rome!) and came hither for the summer. You have
         seen an Epistle to Mr. Ashton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that seems to me full of spirit and thought, and a good deal of poetic fire. I would
         know your opinion. Now I talk of verses, Mr. Walpole and I have frequently wondered
         you should never mention a certain imitation of Spencer, published last year by a
         namesake of yours,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with which we are all enraptured and enmarvailed.</p>
