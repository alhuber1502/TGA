						England. arrives at Paris without knowing it. </p>

						called an AbbÃ©, its parts, &amp; their uses; with the reasons, why they will not live in England, &amp; the methods, that have been
						used to propagate them there. a Cut of the Inside of a Nunnery; it's Structure, wonderfully adapted to the use of the animals, that

						savages blind-fold. how he lights among a certain fat nation, call'd Clouds; how they are always in a
						Sweat, &amp; never speak, but they fart. how they flock about him, &amp; think him very odd for not doing so too. he falls flump into
						Italy.</p>
            <p>12. </p>
            <p>Arrives at Turin; goes to Genoa, &amp; from thence to Placentia; crosses the River Trebia: the Ghost of Hannibal appears to him;

						vulgar opinion, was fought by Land, &amp; that not far from Ravenna. that the Romans were a Colony of the Jews, &amp; that Eneas was the same with Ehud.</p>

						inferiour to the K: Charles at Chareing-Cross. Account of the City, &amp; Manners of the Inhabitants. a learned Dissertation on the
						true Situation of Gomorrah. . . . </p>

            <p>(Which is a dear more than I give any body else. it is very odd to begin with a Parenthesis, but) You may think me a Beast, for not
						haveing sooner wrote to you, &amp; to be sure a Beast I am. now when one owns it, I don't see what you have left to say. I take this
						opportunity to inform you (an opportunity I have had every week this twelvemonth) that I am arrived safe at Calais, &amp; am at
						present at Florence, a city in Italy in I don't know how many degrees N: latitude. under the Line I am sure it is not, for I am at
						this instant expireing with Cold. You must know, that not being certain what circumstances of my History would particularly suit your
						curiosity, &amp; knowing that all I had to say to you would overflow the narrow limits of many a good quire of Paper, I have taken
						this method of laying before you the contents, that you may pitch upon what you please, &amp; give me your orders accordingly to
						expatiate thereupon: for I conclude you will write to me; won't you? oh! yes, when you know, that in a week I set out for Rome, &amp;
						that the Pope is dead, &amp; that I shall be (I should say, God willing; &amp; if nothing
						extraordinary intervene; &amp; if I'm alive, &amp; well; &amp; in all human probability) at the Coronation of a new one. now as you
						have no other correspondent there, &amp; as if you do not, I certainly shall not write again (observe my impudence) I take it to be
						your interest to send me a vast letter, full of all sorts of News, &amp; Bawdy, &amp; Politics, &amp; such other ingredients, as to
						you shall seem convenient with all decent expedition. only do not be too severe upon the Pretender;
						&amp;, if you like my Style, pray say so. this is Ã  la FranÃ§oise; &amp; if you think it a little too foolish, &amp; impertinent; you
						shall be treated alla Toscana with a thousand Signoria Illustrissima's. in the mean time I have the honour to remain</p>
