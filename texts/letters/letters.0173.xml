            <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p> As I live in a place, where even the ordinary tattle of the town arrives not till it is stale, and which produces no events of its
					own, you will not desire any excuse from me for writing so seldom, especially as of all people living I know you are the least a friend
					to letters spun out of one's own brains, with all the toil and constraint that accompanies sentimental productions. I have been here at
					Stoke a few days (where I shall continue good part of the summer); and having put an end to a thing,
					whose beginning you have seen long ago, I immediately send it you.
					You will, I hope, look upon it in the light of a <hi rend="italic">thing with an end to it</hi>; a merit that most of my writings have
					wanted, and are like to want, but which this epistle I am determined shall not want, when it tells you that I am ever</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Yours, </salute>
            <signed>T. GRAY. </signed>
         </closer>
         <postscript>
            <p>Not that I have done yet; but who could avoid the temptation of finishing so roundly and so cleverly in the manner of good queen
						Anne's days? Now I have talked of writings; I have seen a book, which is by this time in the press, against Middleton (though without
						naming him), by Asheton. As far as I can judge from a very hasty reading, there are things in it new
						and ingenious, but rather too prolix, and the style here and there savouring too strongly of sermon. I imagine it will do him credit.
						So much for other people, now to <hi rend="italic">self</hi> again. You are desired to tell me your opinion, if you can take the
						pains, of these lines.</p>
