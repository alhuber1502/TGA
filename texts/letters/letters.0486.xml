					       <dateline>Jermyn Street, October 23, 1766. </dateline>
					       <salute>Dear Sir </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>I observed that Ansel was dead, and made the same reflection about it that you did. I also wrote to
					remind N: of it, but have heard nothing since. We have great scarcity of news here. Everything is in
					Lord Ch.'s breast. If what lies hid there be no better than what comes to light, I would not give
					sixpence to know it. Spain was certainly offered to Lord Weymouth, and in the second place, some say
					to Sandwich; at last, perhaps, Sir James Gray may go. But who goes Secretary do you think? I leave Mr. T. and you ten guesses a-piece, and yet they will
					be all wrong. Mr. Prowse has refused the Post Office. I do not believe in any more dukes, unless, perhaps, my Lord Marquis of Rockingham should like it. The Prince of Wales has been ill of what they
					call a fever. They say he is better, but Sir J. Pringle continues to lie every night at Kew. My Lady
					â€” has discarded Thynne and taken to Sir T. Delaval, they say.
					The clothes are actually making, but possibly she may jilt them both. The clerk who was displaced in the Post Office lost 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi> a year. Would you think there could be such under-offices there? Have you read Mr. Grenville's
						Considerations on the merits of his own Administration? It is all figures; so, I suppose, it must be
					true. Have you read Mr. Sharp the surgeon's Travels into Italy? I recommend these two authors to you
					instead of Livy and Quintilian.
				</p>
				     <p>Palgrave, I suppose, you have by this time seen and sifted; if not, I must tell you, his letter was dated from Glamis, 30th Sept.,
					Tuesday night. He was that day returned from my tour in the Highlands, delighted with their beauties, though he saw the Alps last year.
					The Friday following he was to set out for Hetton, where his stay would not be long; then pass four
					days at Newby, and as much at York, and so to Cambridge, where, ten to one, he has not yet arrived.
						Tom outstripped Lord Panmure at the county court at Forfar all to
					nothing. Dr. Richmond is body chaplain to the Duke of Athol, lives at Dunkeld, and eats muir-fowls' livers every day. If you know this already, who can help it?</p>
				     <p>Pray tell me, how do you do; and let me know the sum total of my bill.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu.<lb/> I am ever yours, </salute>
					       <signed>T. G. </signed>
				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p>Commend me to Mr. Talbot and Dr. Gisborne. Delaval is coming to you. Is Mr. Mapletoft there? If not, he will lie in my rooms. </p>
				     </postscript>
