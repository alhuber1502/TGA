      <p>Upon my return hither after an absence of about three weeks,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I find a letter, &amp; a present<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> inclosed in it from you. I receive, &amp; shall wear it, with pleasure both as a mark
         of your kindness, &amp; as it is in itself excessively pretty: but yet I have some little
         scruples of conscience. I own, it feels to me like a robbery of M<span class="super">rs</span> Bedingfield.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the crime is chiefly yours, but I am the Receiver. you indeed may make your peace
         on easy terms, but what attonement can I make her?
      </p>
      <p>I accept too with pleasure the marks of approbation you bestow on my two fragments,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but here I have still greater scruples. I will not enter into a discussion of them;
         but only tell you, that <span class="hi">admiration</span> is a word, that has no place between two people, that ever mean to come together.
         besides (believe me) there is but one thing in life, that deserves it, &amp; that is not
         Poetry. I leave it to time, &amp; to our nearer acquaintance to abate your fervour (tho'
         setting aside my present interest in it, I do think it is the best of faults) &amp; demand
         of you a little more severity, than I have hitherto experienced. here is the continuation
         of the British Ode,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on w<span class="super">ch</span> you may exercise it.

      <p>It is true, as you have been told, that M<span class="super">r</span> Bentley (of whose taste &amp; invention the Prints<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you have seen may give you some Idea, tho' not at all of his spirit or execution)
         has made a sketch or two of this story,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but I have never seen them myself. the thought, w<span class="super">ch</span> you applaud, in those lines, <span class="hi">Loose his beard</span> &amp;c:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is borrow'd from painting. Rafael in his Vision of Ezekiel (in the Duke of Orleans'
         Collection) has given the air of head, w<span class="super">ch</span> I tried to express, to God the Father;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or (if you have been at Parma) you may remember Moses breaking the Tables by the
         Parmeggiano, w<span class="super">ch</span> comes still nearer to my meaning. the words you see are almost stoln from Milton,
         speaking of Azazel's Standard

      <p>I must tell you too, that <span class="hi">Thoughts that breath,</span> &amp;c:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is an imitation of Cowley

      <p>The <span class="hi">Knell of parting day</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is taken from Dante, who describing a Pilgrim listening to the evening-bell says

         them a hundred more instances, w<span class="super">ch</span> they never will discover themselves. I lay no injunctions of secrecy upon you with
         <span class="hi">regard to verses</span>, but leave them to your prudence. only I should be very sorry, they were transcribed,
         or retain'd in any one's memory. and one thing I must say, (but this is sacred, &amp;
         under the seal of confession) there is no Woman, that can take pleasure in this kind
         of composition. if Parts only &amp; Imagination &amp; Sensibility were required, one might
         (I doubt not) find them in that Sex full as easily as in our own: but there is a certain
         measure of learning necessary, &amp; a long acquaintance with the good Writers ancient
         &amp; modern, w<span class="super">ch</span> by our injustice is denied to them. and without this they can only catch here &amp; there
         a florid expression, or a musical rhyme, while the Whole appears to them a wild obscure
         unedifying jumble. after saying this, I leave you at liberty.
      </p>
      <p>I am so unfix'd, when absent from Cambridge, that I can hardly hope to receive the
         visit you flatter me with in any other place. I shall return thither the beginning
         of November<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at farthest, when if any thing should call you to London, I shall not lie a great
         deal out of your road. at your own peril be it. I am not capable of doing the honours
