      <p>I am at last return'd to my old Squirrel's nest from the Highlands, wch would be Italy,
         if they had but a climate, &amp; even that was not wanting for the few days I pass'd among
         them. there it is, that the beauties of Scotland lie hid. of the Lowlands, wch every
         true Scotsman celebrates as a Paradise,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I shall only say, they are better than Northumberland (don't tell Mr Delaval) &amp; the
         nearer they come to the Mountains the better they grow. I return'd by Stirling, being
         a foe to drowning<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (tho' it be 35 miles about) to Edinburgh, &amp; from thence to Old Park, where after
         a fortnight's repose leaving the good family in a hopeful way to increase,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; charged with many civilities to you &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">fruitless</span> invitations I got in three days (including nights) to London.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the particulars of my travels I must defer, till I see you, when we shall have many
         chapters to treat. I did not visit the new-married couple,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> because he prohibited me to touch<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> his Wife, wch is a distinction reserved for you.
      </p>
      <p>The night after I arrived, the D: of Cumberland died.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the preceding night he pass'd at Windsor, &amp; meant to be at Court in the morning,
         but overslept himself &amp; came too late to Town. between 7 &amp; 8 he found his usual Asthma
         more troublesome than ordinary, &amp; going to a window threw it up for air. after a few
         minutes he said it was too cold for him, complain'd of a shivering &amp; an uncommon sensation
         in his arms, &amp; desired to be help'd to a couch. he was immediately bloodied, &amp; then
         throwing himself back said <span style="font-style:italic">it was all over: they could do him no good,</span> &amp; expired instantly. there was to be a Cabinet-council that night at his house, &amp;
         three of them were just then arrived. I do not hear, that this event will make any
         present alteration in Men or measures. the D: of N:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> cries his eyes out, &amp; will not be comforted: so you<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> must do so too, <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but have a care you don't do it in earnest.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Adieu, Dear Sr, I should be glad, you would send me the <span style="font-style:italic">Sum Total</span> of my bill,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the novelties of Cambridge of wch all I know is, that poor Lobb<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is dead. where is the Abb√©,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; what does he say &amp; do? Ld St:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wonders, he never answer'd his letter of invitation.
