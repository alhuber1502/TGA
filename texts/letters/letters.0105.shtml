         <div class="dateline">Florence, Aug. 21, N.S. 1740. </div>
      </div>
      <p>It is some time since I have had the pleasure of writing to you, having been upon
         a little excursion cross the mountains to Bologna. We set out from hence at sunset,
         passed the Apennines by moon-light, travelling incessantly till we came to Bologna
         at four in the afternoon next day. There we spent a week agreeably enough, and returned
         as we came. The day before yesterday arrived the news of a Pope; and I have the mortification
         of being within four days journey of Rome, and not seeing his coronation, the heats
         being violent, and the infectious air now at its height. We had an instance, the other
         day, that it is not only fancy. Two country fellows, strong men, and used to the country
         about Rome, having occasion to come from thence hither, and travelling on foot, as
         common with them, one died suddenly on the road; the other got hither, but extremely
         weak, and in a manner stupid; he was carried to the hospital, but died in two days.
         So, between fear and laziness, we remain here, and must be satisfied with the accounts
         other people give us of the matter. The new Pope is called Benedict XIV. being created
         Cardinal by Benedict XIII.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the last Pope but one. His name is Lambertini, a noble Bolognese, and Archbishop
         of that city.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> When I was first there, I remember to have seen him two or three times; he is a short,
         fat man, about sixty-five years of age, of a hearty, merry countenance, and likely
         to live some years. He bears a good character for generosity, affability, and other
         virtues; and, they say, wants neither knowledge nor capacity. The worst side of him
         is, that he has a nephew or two; besides a certain young favourite, called Melara,
         who is said to have had, for some time, the arbitrary disposal of his purse and family.
         He is reported to have made a little speech to the Cardinals in the Conclave, while
         they were undetermined about an election, as follows: 'Most eminent Lords, here are
         three Bolognese of different characters, but all equally proper for the Popedom. If
         it be your pleasures, to pitch upon a Saint, there is Cardinal Gotti;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if upon a Politician, there is Aldrovandi;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if upon a Booby, here am I.' The Italian is much more expressive, and, indeed, not
         to be translated; wherefore, if you meet with any body that understands it, you may
         show them what he said in the language he spoke it. 'Eminssimi. Sigri. Ci siamo trÃ©,
         diversi sÃ¬, mÃ  tutti idonei al Papato. Si vi piace un Santo, c' Ã¨ l'Gotti;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> se volete una testa scaltra, e Politica, c' Ã¨ l'AldrovandÃ©;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> se un Coglione, eccomi!' Cardinal Coscia<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (the late Pope's nephew) as he has had no hand in this election, it is hoped, will
         be called to account for all his villanous practices. The Pretender, they say, has
         resigned all his pretensions to his eldest boy, and will accept of the Grand Chancellorship,
         which is thirty thousand crowns a-year; the pension he has at present is only twenty
         thousand. I do not affirm the truth of this last article; because, if he does, it
         is necessary he should take the ecclesiastical habit, and it will sound mighty odd
         to be called his Majesty the Chancellor. â&#x80;&#x94; So ends my Gazette.</p>
