      <p>It feels to me as if it were a long while, since I heard from you. not a word to flatter
         or to abash the vanity of an Author! suffer me then to tell you, that I hear, we are
         not at all popular. the great objection is obscurity, no body knows what we would
         be at. one Man (a Peer)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have been told of, that thinks the last Stanza of the 2d Ode relates to Charles
         the first &amp; Oliver Cromwell. in short the <span style="font-style:italic">Î£Ï&#x85;Î½ÎµÏ&#x84;Î¿á½·</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> appear to be still fewer, than even I expected.</p>
      <p>You will imagine all this does not go very deep; but I have been almost eversince
         I was here exceedingly dispirited, besides being really ill in body. no gout, but
         something feverish, that seems to come almost every morning, &amp; disperses soon after
         I am up. the Cobhams<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are here, &amp; as civil as usual. Garrick &amp; his Wife have been down with them some days,
         &amp; are soon to come again. except the little amusement they give me, &amp; two volumes
         of the Encyclopedie<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> now almost exhausted, I have nothing but my own thoughts to feed upon, &amp; you know
         they are of the gloomy cast. write to me then for <span style="font-style:italic">sweet St Charity,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; remember, that while I am my own, I am most faithfully</p>
