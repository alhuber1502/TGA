         <div class="salute">Dear Molly </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am almost afraid of advising you for fear I should hurt, where I mean to serve you.</p>
      <p>I think M<span class="super">r</span> M: &amp; your Friends in Town mean exceedingly well, &amp; deserve your acknowledgements:
         but when they propose this method of proceeding, they are ignorant of what has passed.</p>
      <p>I entirely approve of your answer in every respect, as it is. what if you added to
         it, (as in confidence to M<span class="super">r</span> M:,) that a Friend of yours had found means to recommend you not long since to the
         two Lords at the head of that Board, &amp; had received a very favourable answer in case
         of your Mamma's death. that you have reason to believe, there was nobody before you
         on their list, &amp; that they would not easily give ear to any applications made to your
         prejudice.</p>
      <p>That nevertheless you were conscious, many accidents might arise to disappoint these
         hopes; &amp; fully sensible of how much consequence the kind foresight &amp; assistance of
         the M<span class="super">r</span> P:<span class="super">s</span> may be to you in all senses; &amp; that you therefore did desire M<span class="super">r</span> M: would communicate your letter (if he thinks it proper) to them, &amp; entreat the
         continuance of their favourable intentions to you &amp; to your Sister.</p>
      <p>This you will put into your own style (w<span class="super">ch</span> is always best) but before you do so, consider whether it agree with your own sentiments,
         &amp; whether you foresee any ill, that may arise from it, w<span class="super">ch</span> does not occur to me: for my notion is, that generally People judge best upon due
         reflection in their own affairs.</p>
      <p>I will see you after dinner.</p>
