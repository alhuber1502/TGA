         <div class="salute">Dear Mason </div>
      </div>
      <p>As to my pardon, for which you supplicate, you know too well how easily it is obtain'd
         without any reason at all: but now I have a very good one, as I have read the third
         Book of <span style="font-style:italic">the Ghost,</span>  where Churchill has so mumbled Mr Whitehead, to whom you owe all your principles
         (see the unpublish'd elegy <span style="font-style:italic">de Amiciti√¢</span>) that it would be base in me to demand any farther satisfaction. this only I shall
         add, that I would rather steal the Laureate's verses, than his sentiments.
      </p>
      <p>I am sorry for the disagreeable event you mention, wch I learnt by mere accident from
         Mr Curtall in a Coffee-House: I do not doubt, it must have taken up a good deal of
         your thoughts &amp; time, &amp; should wish to know, whether there are any hopes of the poor
         Fellow's recovery.
      </p>
      <p>We have received your poetical packet, &amp; deliver'd them to the several parties. the
         sentiments we do not remark, as we can find nothing within ourselves congenial to
         them. for the expression, we hint (but in a low &amp; timid voice) that there is a want
         of <span style="font-style:italic">strength</span> &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">spirit</span>: in short they are nothing like the Choruses in Elfrida. only the lines that relate
         to Lady Cov:s beauty have made a deep impression upon us: we get them by heart, &amp;
         apply them to our Sempstresses &amp; Bedmakers. this is (I think) the sum &amp; substance
         of our reflections here. only Mrs Rutherforth observes, that there is great delicacy
         &amp; tenderness in the manner of treating so frail a character as that of L:y Cov:, &amp;
         that you have found a way to reconcile contempt &amp; compassion. these might not be her
         words, but this was the sense of them; &amp; I don't believe, she had it from the Doctor.
      </p>
      <p>I rejoice (in a weakly way, you may be sure, as I have not seen him some years, &amp;
         am in so different a way of life) but I rejoice to hear of any accession to Mr Hurd's
         fortune, as I do not believe he will be any thing the worse for it. Forester (whom
         I perceive you can still remember) is removed from Easton to a better living by his
         Patron Ld Maynard on purpose to get rid of him, for Easton is his own parish, &amp; he
         was sick to death of his company. he is now seated just by his Brother Pulter, &amp; they
         are mortal foes.
      </p>
      <p>Mr Brockett has got old Turner's Professorship, &amp; Delaval has lost it. when we meet
         I have something to tell you on this subject. I hope to continue here till March:
         if not, I shall inform you. how does the Peace agree with you?
      </p>
