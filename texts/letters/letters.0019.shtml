      <p>You use me very cruelly: You have sent me but one letter since I have been at Oxford,
         and that too agreeable not to make me sensible how great my loss is in not having
         more. Next to seeing you is the pleasure of seeing your handwriting; next to hearing
         you is the pleasure of hearing from you. Really and sincerely I wonder at you, that
         you thought it not worth while to answer my last letter. I hope this will have better
         success in behalf of your quondam school-fellow; in behalf of one who has walked hand
         in hand with you, like the two children in the wood,

         me very seriously here in a strange country, inhabited by things that call themselves
         Doctors and Masters of Arts; a country flowing with syllogisms and ale, where Horace
         and Virgil are equally unknown; consider me, I say, in this melancholy light, and
         then think if something be not due to
