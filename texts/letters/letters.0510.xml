         </opener>
         <p>I have received a letter from Howe, another from Mr Beattie, &amp;
					a third, wch was a printed Catalogue, from London. the parcel sent to Cambridge was a set of Algarotti's works for your Library, wch need not be impatient, if it remain unopen'd, till I
					come. the Doctor &amp; I came hither on Saturday last: he return'd on Wednesday, &amp; I set out for London (pray for me!) at ten
					o'clock tomorrow night. you will please to direct to me at Roberts's, as usual, &amp; when it is
					convenient I shall be glad of my Bill. I will trouble you also to give notice of my motions to Miss
						Antrobus, as soon as you can.</p>
         <p>Here has been Ld Holdernesse's ugly face, since I was here, &amp; here actually is Mr
						Weddell, who enquires after you. Pa: is in London with his Brother,
					who is desperate: if he dies, We shall not be a shilling the better, so we are really very sorrowful. Mason desires his love to
					you.</p>
