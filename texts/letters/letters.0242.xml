					       <p>ADVICE OF Dr OLIVER TO Sr JOHN COPE ON HIS GETTING ST ANTONY'S
							FIRE BY DRINKING THE BATH WATERS OUT OF MISS MOLLY'S HAND. </p>
					       <p>BY LORD BATH.
					</p>
					       <p>See gentle Cope with gout and love opprest, <lb/> Alternate torments raging in his breast, <lb/> Tries at his cure, but tampers
						still in vain; <lb/> What lessens one, augments the other pain. <lb/> The charming Nymph, who strives to give relief, <lb/> Instead
						of comfort, heightens all his grief: <lb/> For health he drinks, then sighs for love, &amp; cries, <lb/> Health's in her hand,
						destruction in her eyes. <lb/> She gives us water, but each touch alas! <lb/> The wanton Girl electrifies the glass. <lb/> To cure
						the gout, we drink large draughts of Love, <lb/> And then, like Ætna, burst in flames above. <lb/>
               <lb/> The Advice <lb/> Sip not,
						dear Knight, the Daughter's liquid fire, <lb/> But take the healing bev'rage from the Sire: <lb/> Twill ease thy gout – for
						Love no cure is known; <lb/> The God of physic coud not cure his own. </p>
					       <p>ON LD DARL —'s BEING MADE JOINT PAYMASTER. </p>
					       <p>Wonders, Newcastle, mark thy ev'ry hour;<lb/> But this last Act's a plenitude of pow'r: <lb/>
						Nought but the force of an almighty reign <lb/> Coud make a <hi rend="italic">Paymaster</hi> of Harry V—.
					</p>
					       <p>ON SPLITTING THE PAY OFFICE. </p>
					       <p>Holles, not past his childhood yet, retains<lb/> The maxims of his Nurse or Tutor's pains: <lb/>
						Thence did the mighty Babe this truth derive, <lb/> Two negatives make one affirmative: <lb/> But ah! Two Dunces never made a Wit,
						<lb/> Nor can two Darlingtons compose a Pitt.
					</p>
				     </q>
				     <p>To draw poetry from you, I send you these mediocre verses, the only ones in fashion. the first lines indeed are pretty, when one
					considers they were writ by a Man of seventy, Lord Bath. the first Epigram was a thought of George
						Selwyn, rhimed; the last is scarce a thought at all.</p>
				     <p>Ministers, Patriots, Wits, poets, paymasters, all are dispersed &amp; gone out of town. The Changes are made, &amp; all preferments
					given away: you will be glad to hear that our Colonel Montagu has
					got a regiment. Lord Waldgrave last night hearing them talk over these histories, said with a
					melancholy tone, alas! they talk so much of giving places for life, I wish they dont give me mine for
					life!</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu! I expect prodigious interest for my pômes. <lb/> Yrs ever </salute>
