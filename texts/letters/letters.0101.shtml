      <p>I lived at the Temple till I was sick of it: I have just left it, and find myself
         as much a lawyer as I was when I was in it. It is certain, at least, I may study the
         law here as well as I could there. My being in chambers did not signify to me a pinch
         of snuff. They tell me my father was a lawyer, and, as you know, eminent in the profession;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and such a circumstance must be of advantage to me. My uncle<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> too makes some figure in West-minster hall; and there's another advantage: Then my
         grandfather's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> name would get me many friends. Is it not strange that a young fellow, that might
         enter the world with so many advantages, will not know his own interest? &amp;c. &amp;c.–What
         shall I say in answer to all this? For money, I neither dote upon it nor despise it;
         it is a necessary stuff enough. For ambition, I do not want that neither; but it is
         not to sit upon a bench. In short, is it not a disagreeable thing to force one's inclination,
         especially when one's young? not to mention that one ought to have the strength of
         a Hercules to go through our common law; which, I am afraid, I have not. Well! but
         then, say they, if one profession does not suit you, you may choose another more to
         your inclination. Now I protest I do not yet know my own inclination, and I believe,
         if that was to be my direction, I should never fix at all: There is no going by a
         weathercock.–I could say much more upon this subject; but there is no talking tête-à-tête
         cross the Alps. O the folly of young men, that never know their own interest! they
         never grow wise till they are ruined! and then nobody pities them, nor helps them.–Dear
         Gray! consider me in the condition of one that has lived these two years without any
         person that he can speak freely to. I know it is very seldom that people trouble themselves
         with the sentiments of those they converse with; so they can chat about trifles, they
         never care whether your heart aches or no. Are you one of these? I think not. But
         what right have I to ask you this question? Have we known one another enough, that
         I should expect or demand sincerity from you? Yes, Gray, I hope we have; and I have
         not quite such a mean opinion of myself, as to think I do not deserve it.–But, Signor,
         is it not time for me to ask something about your further intentions abroad? Where
         do you propose going next? an in Apuliam? nam illò si adveneris, tanquam Ulysses,
         cognosces tuorum neminem. Vale. So Cicero prophesies in the end of one of his letters<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>–and there I end.</p>
