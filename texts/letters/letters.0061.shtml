   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>I am coming away all so fast, and leaving behind me, without the least remorse, all
         the beauties of Sturbridge Fair.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Its white bears may roar, its apes may wring their hands, and crocodiles cry their
         eyes out, all's one for that; I shall not once visit them, nor so much as take my
         leave. The university has published a severe edict against schismatical congregations,
         and created half a dozen new little procterlings to see its orders executed, being
         under mighty apprehensions lest Henley<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and his gilt tub should come to the Fair and seduce their young ones; but their pains
         are to small purpose, for lo, after all, he is not coming.</p>
      <p>I am at this instant in the very agonies of leaving college, and would not wish the
         worst of my enemies a worse situation. If you knew the dust, the old boxes, the bedsteads,
         and tutors that are about my ears, you would look upon this letter as a great effort
         of my resolution and unconcernedness in the midst of evils. I fill up my paper with
         a loose sort of version of that scene in Pastor Fido<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that begins, Care selve beati.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
