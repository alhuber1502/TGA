      <p>I am coming away all so fast, and leaving behind me, without the least remorse, all
         the beauties of Sturbridge Fair. Its white bears may roar, its apes may wring their
         hands, and crocodiles cry their eyes out, all's one for that; I shall not once visit
         them, nor so much as take my leave. The university has published a severe edict against
         schismatical congregations, and created half a dozen new little procterlings to see
         its orders executed, being under mighty apprehensions lest Henley and his gilt tub
         should come to the Fair and seduce their young ones; but their pains are to small
         purpose, for lo, after all, he is not coming.
      </p>
      <p>I am at this instant in the very agonies of leaving college, and would not wish the
         worst of my enemies a worse situation. If you knew the dust, the old boxes, the bedsteads,
         and tutors that are about my ears, you would look upon this letter as a great effort
         of my resolution and unconcernedness in the midst of evils. I fill up my paper with
         a loose sort of version of that scene in Pastor Fido that begins, Care selve beati.
