            <salute>Dear Sir </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>To-morrow morning I set out for Canterbury. If any letter comes, I believe it will be better to
					direct to me as usual at Mr. Roberts's here, and he will take care to send it. I know not how long my
					stay in Kent may be: it depends on the agreeability of Mr. Robinson and his wife.</p>
         <p>You expect to hear who is Secretary of State. I cannot tell. It is sure this morning it was not
					determined; perhaps Lord Egmont; perhaps Lord Hardwicke (for I do not
					believe he has refused, as is said); perhaps you may hear of three instead of two. Charles Townshend
					affirms he has rejected both that office and a peerage; doubtless from his firm adherence to Mr. Pittâ€“a name which the court, I
					mean Lord Tt., Lord Nd., and even Lord B. himself, at present affect to celebrate, with what design you are to judge. You have doubtless heard of the honour done to your
					friend Mrs. Macaulay. Mr. Pitt has made a panegyric of her <hi rend="italic">History</hi> in the
						house. It is very true Wilkes has arrived. The tumults in Spain spread wider and wider, while at Naples they are publicly thanking God for their cessation; perhaps you may
					hear. All is not well in Ireland. It is very late at night. Adieu. Pa.
					went home to-day and Mr. Weddell with him. J. Wheeler has returned from
					Lisbon. The great match will not be till after Christmas. Tom is gone
					to Scotland. It is sure the lady did refuse both Lord Mountstuart and
					the Duke of Beaufort.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Good-night.</salute>
