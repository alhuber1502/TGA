					       <salute>Dear Sir </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>Where are you? for I wrote to you last week to know how soon we should set out, and how we should
					go. Mason writes to-day, he will expect us at Aston in Whitsun-week; and has ordered all his lilacs and roses to be in flower. What can
					you be doing? And so as I said, shall we go in the Newcastle post-coach or the York coach? Will you choose to come to town or be taken
					up on the way? Or will you go all the way to Bawtry in a chaise with me and see sights? Answer me
					speedily. In return I will tell you that you will soon hear great news; but whether good or bad is hard to say; therefore I shall
					prudently tell you nothing more.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu.â€“I am ever yours,</salute>
					       <signed>T. G. </signed>

				     <postscript>
					       <p>Old Pa. is still here, going to Ranelagh and the Opera. Lady Strathmore is with child, and not very well, as I hear. </p>
