         <p> Get some coarse brown Bay Salt: this is the sine quÃ¢ non, &amp; (by the way) is not to be had at Cambridge, where under the name
				of Bay Salt they sell a whitish Kind of Salt, that will never do for our Purpose, &amp; will spoil all: at London the true Sort is
				common in every Shop, &amp; a Pennyworth of it is enough to make a Bushel of Perfumes. Take a Peck of Damask Roses, pick'd from the
				Cups, Orange Flowers all you can get, Cloves (the Spice) a Quarter of an Ounce, cut small: scatter them in your Jar mixt in Layers about
				2 Inches thick, &amp; thinly sprinkle the Salt over them: repeat this, 'till the Vessel is three Quarters, or more, full: cover it close
				down, let it stand 2 Days, &amp; then stir it up well with a wooden Ladle or Skimmer: repeat this often, &amp; it is made. If it is
				always moist to the Touch, it is right: if over-wet, you have only to put in more Flowers, &amp; no more Salt. You may use, if you
				please, Tops of Lavender, Myrtle-Leaves bruised, Rose-Geranium, Angelica, Shavings of Orrice-Root, or (where Orange Flowers are scarce)
				young green Oranges sliced, or even the yellow Rind of Seville-Oranges: but of these Things a very little will do, least they overpower
				the Rest. I can not be particular as to Quantities, because I observed none myself.</p>
