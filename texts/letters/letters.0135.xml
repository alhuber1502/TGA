					       <salute>Dear Sr</salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>You are so good to enquire after my usual Time of comeing to Town; it is at a Season, when even You, the perpetual Friend of London,
					will I fear hardly be in it, the Middle of June: and I commonly return hither in September, a Month, when I may more probably find you
					at home. I do not imagine that any Thing farther can be done with Mr Turner, but You only, who saw the Manner of his promiseing, can judge of that. what he calls the College, is the
						Master&amp; his Party of Fellows, among wch he himself has been reckon'd latterly: but, I know, it
					must be from some other Influence, than that of the Master merely, if he vote with them; wch if Mr Brudenel could stand, might very likely be made Use of (as he is nearly related to several People of Condition) but
					he is disqualified at present in every Sense. 'tis likely indeed he is intended for next Year, &amp; Mr Turner has had some Application
					made already, by his knowing anything about him; but he mistakes the Time.</p>
				     <p>Our Defeat to be sure is a rueful Affair for the Honour of the Troops, but the Duke is gone, it seems, with the Rapidity of a Cannon-Bullet to undefeat us again. the Common-People in Town at
					least know how to be afraid: but We are such <hi rend="italic">uncommon</hi> People here as to have no more Sense of Danger, then if
					the Battle had been fought when &amp; where the Battle of Cann√¶ was. the Perception of these Calamities and of their Consequences, that
					we are supposed to get from Books, is so faintly impress'd, that we talk of War, Famine, &amp; Pestilence with no more Apprehension,
					than of a broken Head, or of a Coach overturn'd between York &amp; Edinburgh. I heard three People, sensible middle-aged Men (when the
					Scotch were said to be at Stamford, &amp; actually were at Derby) talking of hireing a Chaise to go
					to Caxton, (a Place in the high Road) to see the Pretender &amp; the Highlanders, as they passed.</p>
				     <p>I can say no more for Mr Pope, (for what You keep in Reserve may be worse than all the Rest) it is natural to wish the finest Writer,
					one of them, we ever had should be an honest Man. it is for the Interest even of that Virtue, whose Friend he profess'd himself, &amp;
					whose Beauties he sung, that he should not be found a dirty Animal. but however this is Mr
						Warburton's Business, not mine, who may scribble his Pen to the Stumps &amp; all in vain, if these
					Facts are so. it is not from what he told me about himself that I thought well of him, but from a
					Humanity &amp; Goodness of Heart, ay, &amp; Greatness of Mind, that runs thro his private Correspondence, not less apparent than are a
					thousand little Vanities &amp; Weaknesses mixed with those good Qualities, for no body ever took him for a Philosopher.</p>
				     <p>If you know anything of Mr Mann's State of Health &amp; Happiness, or the Motions of Mr Chute
					homewards, it will be a particular Favour to inform me of them, as I have not heard this half year from them.</p>
