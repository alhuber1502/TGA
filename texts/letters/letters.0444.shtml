         <div class="salute">Dear Mary </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am extremely concerned at the account you give me of poor Dolly's sufferings. the
         severeness of the pain makes me believe, that (when you wrote) her distemper was drawing
         to its crisis, &amp; the abscess might find a vent of itself, w<span class="super">ch</span> is most to be wish'd.</p>
      <p>I am no friend to Surgeons, &amp; in this case particularly, (as the seat of her malady
         is so near a very tender part, that is not to be trifled with,) I should by no means
         suffer them to proceed to any operation without the Professor's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> inspection &amp; advice. if he declares it necessary, let her not be frighted at the
         sight of steel, for I can tell her upon some experience,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that one half-hour of the pain she undergoes from her illness is much more, than
         all she will suffer from M<span class="super">r</span> Thackeray's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> hand. I talk as supposing it still to come, but perhaps it is all over, &amp; I may congratulate
         her on having got rid of this evil, &amp; with it of those illnesses she has suffer'd
         so much from these two years, for it is possible Nature may have found out this means
         to free her from those complaints. I heartily wish her well, &amp; hope to hear again
         from you soon.</p>
      <p>I have been detain'd in Town till now, &amp; go not to Southampton till Wednesday. when
         I get thither, I shall let M<span class="super">r</span> Brown know, where I am lodged, &amp; you will send your letter to him to direct.</p>
      <p>My complements to M<span class="super">rs</span> A:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>, pray tell me about B:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; his Wife, if they have been to see you.</p>
