         <p>If you have been happy, where you are, or merely better in health for any of your employments, or idlenesses, you need no apologies
					with me: my end is answer'd, &amp; I am satisfied. one goes to school to the World some time, before one learns precisely how long a
					Visit ought to last. at this day I do not pretend to know it exactly, &amp; very often find out (when it is too late) that I have
					stay'd half an hour too long. I shall not wonder therefore, if your Friend should make a mistake of half a year, if your occasions did
					not call you to Town sooner. when you come, I should hope, you would stay the winter, but can advise nothing in a point, where my own
					interest is so much concerned. pray, let me know of your arrival immediately, that I may cut short my visitation here, or at least (if
					you are taken up always at Sion, or Kensington) may meet you at
						Hounslow, or at Billy Robinson's, or somewhere. my only employment
					&amp; amusement in Town (where I have continued all the summer (till Michaelmas) has been the Mus√¶um: but I have been rather
					historically than poetically given. with a little of your encouragement perhaps I may return to my old Lydgate &amp; Occleve, whose works are there in abundance. I can write you no news from hence; yet I have lately heard <hi rend="italic">ill-news,</hi> wch I shall not write.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu, Dear Mason &amp; believe me most faithfully<lb/> Yours. </salute>
         </closer>
         <postscript>
            <p>At the Lady Viscountess Cobham's at Stoke-House near Windsor, Bucks. </p>
            <p>Your Friend, Dr Plumptree, has lately sate for his picture to Wilson. the Motto in large letters (the measure of wch he himself prescribed) is, Non magna loquimur, sed vivimus;
						i:e: We don't say much, but we hold good livings. </p>
