					Invitation, &amp; shall be glad to make you a Visit at Strawberry-Hill. the Week I leave to you; it
					is indifferent to me, what Time next Month it shall be: Mr Walpole &amp; Comp: will settle it among them. you must inform me what Place
					on the Windsor Road is nearest Twickenham, for I am no Geographer: there I will be at the appointed Day, &amp; from thence you must
					fetch me. </p>
				     <p>Nicolini with a whole Coach-full of the Chattichees has been at Cambridge in an Equipage like that
					of Destiny &amp; his Comrades in the Roman Comique. they said they had been in the Meridional Parts
					of Great-Britain, &amp; were now visiting the Oriental. your Friend Dr Middleton has married really a pretty kind of Woman both in Figure &amp; Manner, wch is strange methinks. </p>
