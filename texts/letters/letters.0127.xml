         <p>Mine, you are to know, is a white Melancholy, or rather Leucocholy for the most part; which though it seldom laughs or dances, nor
					ever amounts to what one calls Joy or Pleasure, yet is a good easy sort of a state, and Ã§a ne laisse que de s'amuser. The only fault of
					it is insipidity; which is apt now and then to give a sort of Ennui, which makes one form certain little wishes that signify nothing.
					But there is another sort, black indeed, which I have now and then felt, that has somewhat in it like Tertullian's rule of faith, Credo
					quia impossibile est; for it believes, nay, is sure of every thing that is unlikely, so it be but frightful; and, on the other hand,
					excludes and shuts its eyes to the most possible hopes, and every thing that is pleasurable; from this the Lord deliver us! for none
					but he and sunshiny weather can do it. In hopes of enjoying this kind of weather, I am going into the country for a few weeks, but shall be never the nearer any society; so, if you have any charity, you will continue
					to write. My life is like Harry the fourth's supper of Hens. 'Poulets a la broche, Poulets en RagÃ´ut, Poulets en HÃ¢chis, Poulets en
						FricasÃ©es.' Reading here, Reading there; nothing but books with different sauces. Do not let me lose
					my desert then; for though that be Reading too, yet it has a very different flavour. The May seems to be come since your invitation;
					and I propose to bask in her beams and dress me in her roses.</p>
         <q>
            <p>Et Caput in vernÃ¢ semper habere rosÃ¢.</p>

         <p>I shall see Mr. [...] and his Wife, nay, and his Child too, for he has got a Boy. Is it not odd to consider one's Cotemporaries in
					the grave light of Husband and Father? There is my Lords [...] and [...], they are Statesmen: Do not
					you remember them dirty boys playing at cricket? As for me, I am never a bit the older, nor the bigger, nor the wiser than I was then:
					No, not for having been beyond sea. Pray how are you?</p>
         <p>I send you an inscription for a wood joining to a park of mine; (it is on the confines of Mount CithÃ¦ron, on the left hand as you go
					to Thebes) you know I am no friend to hunters, and hate to be disturbed by their noise.</p>

         <p>Here follows also the beginning of an Heroic Epistle; but you must give me leave to tell my own story first, because Historians
					differ. Massinissa was the son of Gala King of the Massyli; and, when very young at the head of his father's army, gave a most signal
					overthrow to Syphax, King of the MasÃ¦sylians, then an ally of the Romans. Soon after Asdrubal, son of Gisgo the Carthaginian General,
					gave the beautiful Sophonisba, his daughter, in marriage to the young prince. But this marriage was not consummated on account of
					Massinissa's being obliged to hasten into Spain, there to command his father's troops, who were auxiliaries of the Carthaginians. Their
					affairs at this time began to be in a bad condition; and they thought it might be greatly for their interest, if they could bring over
					Syphax to themselves. This in time they actually effected; and to strengthen their new alliance, commanded Asdrubal to give his
					daughter to Syphax. (It is probable their ingratitude to Massinissa arose from the great change of affairs, which had happened among
					the Massylians during his absence; for his father and uncle were dead, and a distant relation of the royal family had usurped the
					throne.) Sophonisba was accordingly married to Syphax: and Massinissa, enraged at the affront, became a friend to the Romans. They
					drove the Carthaginians before them out of Spain, and carried the war into Africa, defeated Syphax, and took him prisoner; upon which
					Cirtha (his capital) opened her gates to LÃ¦lius and Massinissa. The rest of the affair, the marriage, and the sending of poison, every
					body knows. This is partly taken from Livy, and partly from
						Appian.

            <p>SOPHONISBA MASSINISSÃ&#x86;.</p>
            <p>EPISTOLA.</p>
            <p>Egregium accipio promissi Munus amoris, <lb/> Inque manu mortem jam fruitura fero: <lb/> Atque utinam citius mandasses, luce vel
						unÃ¢; <lb/> Transieram Stygios non inhonesta lacus. <lb/> Victoris nec passa toros, nova nupta, mariti, <lb/> Nec fueram fastus,
						Roma superba, tuos. <lb/> Scilicet hÃ¦c partem tibi, Massinissa, triumphi <lb/> Detractam, hÃ¦c pompÃ¦ jura minora suÃ¦ <lb/> Imputat,
						atque uxor quod non tua pressa catenis, <lb/> Objecta &amp; sÃ¦vÃ¦ plausibus urbis eo: <lb/> Quin tu pro tantis cepisti prÃ¦mia factis,
						<lb/> Magnum RomanÃ¦ pignus amicitiÃ¦! <lb/> ScipiadÃ¦ excuses, oro, si tardius utar <lb/> Munere. Non nimiÃ¹m vivere, crede, velim.
						<lb/> Parva mora est, breve sed tempus mea fama requirit: <lb/> Detinet hÃ¦c animam cura suprema meam. <lb/> QuÃ¦ patriÃ¦ prodesse meÃ¦
						Regina ferebar, <lb/> Inter ElisÃ¦as gloria prima nurus, <lb/> Ne videar flammÃ¦ nimis indulsisse secundÃ¦, <lb/> Vel nimis hostiles
						extimuisse manus. <lb/> Fortunam atque annos liceat revocare priores, <lb/> Gaudiaque heu! quantis nostra repensa malis. <lb/>
						Primitiasne tuas meministi atque arma Syphacis <lb/> Fusa, &amp; per Tyrias ducta trophÃ¦a vias? <lb/> (Laudis at antiquÃ¦ forsan
						meminisse pigebit, <lb/> Quodque decus quondam causa ruboris erit.) <lb/> Tempus ego certe memini, felicia PÅ&#x93;nis <lb/> Quo te non
						puduit solvere vota deis; <lb/> MÃ¦niaque intrantem vidi: longo agmine duxit <lb/> Turba salutantum, purpureique patres. <lb/>
						FÃ¦minea ante omnes longe admiratur euntem <lb/> HÃ¦ret &amp; aspectu tota caterva tuo. <lb/> Jam flexi, regale decus, per colla
						capilli, <lb/> Jam decet ardenti fuscus in ore color! <lb/> Commendat frontis generosa modestia formam, <lb/> Seque cupit laudi
						surripuisse suÃ¦. <lb/> Prima genas tenui signat vix flore juventas, <lb/> Et dextrÃ¦ soli credimus esse virum. <lb/> Dum faciles
						gradiens oculos per singula jactas, <lb/> (Seu rexit casus lumina, sive Venus) <lb/> In me (vel certÃ¨ visum est) conversa morari
						<lb/> Sensi; virgineus perculit ora pudor. <lb/> Nescio quid vultum molle spirare tuendo, <lb/> Credideramque tuos lentius ire
						pedes. <lb/> QuÃ¦rebam, juxta Ã¦qualis si dignior esset, <lb/> QuÃ¦ poterat visus detinuisse tuos: <lb/> Nulla fuit circum Ã¦qualis quÃ¦
						dignior esset, <lb/> Asseruitque decus conscia forma suum. <lb/> PompÃ¦ finis erat. TotÃ¢ vix nocte quievi: <lb/> Sin premat invitÃ¦
						lumina victa sopor, <lb/> Somnus habet pompas, eademque recursat imago; <lb/> Atque iterum hesterno munere victor ades. </p>
