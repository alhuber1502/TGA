      </div>
      <p>I too am set down here with something greater hopes of quiet, than I could entertain,
         when I saw you last. at least nothing new has happen'd to give me any disturbance,
         &amp; the assurances, you gave me in your letter from hence, are pretty-well confirm'd
         by experience. I shall be very ready to take as much of Mr D:p's dullness, as he chuses
         to part with, at any price he pleases, even with his want of sleep &amp; weak Bowels into
         the bargain. and I will be your Curate, &amp; he shall live here with all my wit, &amp; a
         power of learning. Dr Brown's book (I hear) is much admired in Town, wch I do not
         understand. I expected it should be admired here; but they affect not to like it,
         tho' I know they ought. what would you have me do? there is one thing in it I applaud,
         wch is the dissertation against Trade, for I have always said, it was the ruin of
         the Nation. I have read the little wicked book about Evil, that settled Mr Dodsley's
         conscience in that point, &amp; find nothing in it, but absurdity. we call it Soame Jennyns's,
         but I have a notion you mention'd some other name to me, tho' I have forgot it. St:
         has done me the honour to send me your friend Ld Newnham hither with a fine recommendatory
         letter (written by his own desire) in Newmarket-week. do not think he was going to
         New-Market. no! he came in a Solitaire, great Sleeves, jessamine-powder, &amp; a large
         Bouquet of Jonquils within twelve miles of that place on purpose not to go thither.
         we had three days intercourse, talk'd about the Beaux-Arts, &amp; Rome, &amp; Hanover &amp; Mason,
         whose praises we celebrated <span style="font-style:italic">a qui mieux mieux,</span> vowed eternal friendship, embraced, &amp; parted. I promised to write you a thousand
         compliments in his name. I saw also Ld Villiers &amp; Mr Spencer, who carried him back
         with them, <span style="font-style:italic">en passant.</span> they did not like me at all. here has been too the best of all Johns (I hardly except
         the Evangelist, &amp; the Divine) who is not to be sure a bit like my Ld N:, but full
         as well in my mind. the D: of Bedford has brought his Son, ay, &amp; Mr Rigby too. they
         were at Church on Sunday morning, and Mr Sturgeon preach'd to them &amp; the Heads, for
         no body else was present. Mr Franklyn is not his Tutor. these are the most remarkable
         events at Cambridge.
      </p>
      <p>Mr B:y has been here. he had not done what you recommended to him, before he came
         out of Town, &amp; he is return'd thither only the beginning of this week, when he assured
         me he certainly would do it. alas, what may this delay occasion? it is best not to
         think. oh happy Mr D:p!
      </p>
