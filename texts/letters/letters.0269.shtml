         <div class="salute">Dear Mason</div>
      </div>
      <p>I too am set down here with something greater hopes of quiet, than I could entertain,
         when I saw you last. at least nothing new has happen'd to give me any disturbance,
         &amp; the assurances, you gave me in your letter from hence,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are pretty-well confirm'd by experience. I shall be very ready to take as much of
         Mr D:p's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> dullness, as he chuses to part with, at any price he pleases, even with his want
         of sleep &amp; weak Bowels into the bargain. and I will be your Curate, &amp; he shall live
         here with all my wit, &amp; a power of learning. Dr Brown's book<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (I hear) is much admired in Town, wch I do not understand. I expected it should be
         admired here; but they affect not to like it, tho' I know they ought. what would you
         have me do? there is one thing in it I applaud, wch is the dissertation against Trade,
         for I have always said, it was the ruin of the Nation. I have read the little wicked
         book about Evil,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that settled Mr Dodsley's conscience in that point, &amp; find nothing in it, but absurdity.
         we call it Soame Jennyns's, but I have a notion you mention'd some other name to me,
         tho' I have forgot it. St: has done me the honour to send me your friend Ld Newnham<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> hither with a fine recommendatory letter (written by his own desire) in Newmarket-week.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> do not think he was going to New-Market. no! he came in a Solitaire,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> great Sleeves, jessamine-powder, &amp; a large Bouquet of Jonquils within twelve miles
         of that place on purpose not to go thither. we had three days intercourse, talk'd
         about the Beaux-Arts, &amp; Rome, &amp; Hanover &amp; Mason, whose praises we celebrated <span style="font-style:italic">a qui mieux mieux,</span> vowed eternal friendship, embraced, &amp; parted. I promised to write you a thousand
         compliments in his name. I saw also Ld Villiers<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; Mr Spencer,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who carried him back with them, <span style="font-style:italic">en passant.</span> they did not like me at all. here has been too the best of all Johns<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (I hardly except the Evangelist, &amp; the Divine)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who is not to be sure a bit like my Ld N:, but full as well in my mind. the D: of
         Bedford has brought his Son, ay, &amp; Mr Rigby<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> too. they were at Church on Sunday morning, and Mr Sturgeon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> preach'd to them &amp; the Heads, for no body else was present. Mr Franklyn<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is not his Tutor. these are the most remarkable events at Cambridge.
      </p>
      <p>Mr B:y<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been here. he had not done what you recommended to him, before he came out of
         Town, &amp; he is return'd thither only the beginning of this week, when he assured me
         he certainly would do it. alas, what may this delay occasion? it is best not to think.
         oh happy Mr D:p!
      </p>
