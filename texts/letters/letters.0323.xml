					       <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>Having been for a considerable time without any news of you, I have taken it into my head, that you are ill, or that Mrs Wharton is
					so. you will not wonder, if I grow a little superstitious, when you know, that I have not been a step out of the house for this
					fortnight or more past, for Mrs Rogers has been at the point of death with a disorder in her stomach accompanied with continual &amp;
					laborious reachings, &amp; a total loss of appetite, that has reduced her to the weakness of an infant, I mean, her body, tho' her
					senses are still perfect, &amp; (what I think remarkable) she has recover'd the use of her speech (wch for several years had been
					hardly intelligible) &amp; pronounces almost as plain, as ever she did. she is now for three days past, such is the strength of her
					constitution, in a way of recovery: medecine has had nothing to do in it, for she will take nothing prescribed her. when I say
					recovery, I do not mean, that she will ever recover her strength again, but, I think, she may live a good while in this helpless state;
					however it is very precarious, &amp; Dr Hayes believes her quite worn out. I certainly do not put on
					(to you) more tenderness, than I really feel on this occasion, but the approaches of death are always a melancholy object, &amp; common
					humanity must suffer something from such a spectacle </p>
				     <p>It is an age, since I heard any thing from Mason. if I do not mistake, this should be his month of waiting, unless he has exchanged his turn with some body: if he be in Town, you must probably have heard of him,
					&amp; can give me some intelligence. my old new acquaintance Lady Denbigh is here at
						Stokehouse; but I do not believe, I shall be able to get out, or have any opportunity of seeing her,
					while she stays.</p>
				     <p>If my fancies (wch I hope in God are mere fancies) should prove true, I hope you will let somebody tell me, how you do. if not, I
					shall beg you to tell me yourself, as soon as possible, &amp; set my understanding to rights.</p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu, Dear Sr, I am ever <lb/> Most sincerely Yours </salute>
