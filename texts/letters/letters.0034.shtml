      <p>I brought my neck safe to town, &amp; I promise you, when I break it, it shall not be
         after the Dogs, nor from so mean an elevation as the Saddle,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> no, let me fall from Dover-Cliff,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or Leucate's promontory,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; if I cannot die like a Hero, let it be at least like a despairing lover; Mem: I
         wo'nt swing in a Cambrick handkerchief,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> nor swallow Verdigrease. but however I that have preserved my neck in the country,
         have not been able to do as much by my throat in London; which I made so sore, coming
         from Othello, on Wednesday last,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that I should not be easily persuaded even at this present to swallow a bumper, tho'
         it were crown'd with my dear Horace's health; it has not as yet turn'd to an absolute
         squinancie,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or a fever; but if you have a mind, I can very easily improve it into either of 'em:
         you have imitated your Namesake very happily, I believe; for I have not the Latin
         to look at; I wish poor Mr Iccius in Ireland had taken the poets good advice:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> pray add my admiration of the first Stanza's to good Mr Ashton's, &amp; give him my service
         for his, &amp; believe me,</p>
