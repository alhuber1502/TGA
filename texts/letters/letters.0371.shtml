         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am obliged to you for your Letter, &amp; the Bills enclosed, wch I shall take the first
         opportunity I have to satisfy.
      </p>
      <p>I imagine by this time Ld J: is, or has been, with you to settle matters. Mr Onley
         (from whom I have twice heard) consents, tho' with great diffidence of himself, to
         undertake this task: but can not well be there himself, till about the 13th of Nov:r.
         I would gladly hear, what your first impressions are of the young Man, for (I must
         tell you plainly) our M:n, who had seen him at Chatsworth, was not greatly edified,
         but he hopes the best. tomorrow Dr Gisborne &amp; I go to dine with that reverend Gentleman
         at Kensington during his waiting. he makes many kind enquiries after you, but I see
         very little of him, he is so taken up with the Beaux-Arts. he has lately etch'd my
         head with his own hand; &amp; his friend Mr Sandby, the Landscape-Painter, is doing a
         great picture with a view of M: Snowdon, the Bard, Edward the first, &amp;c: now all this
         I take for a Bribe, a sort of Hush-money to me, who caught him last year sitting for
         his own picture; &amp; know, that at this time, there is another Painter doing one of
         the scenes in Elfrida.
      </p>
      <p>In my way to Town I met with the first news of the expedition from Sr Wm Williams,
         who makes a part of it, &amp; perhaps may lay his fine Vandyke-Head in the dust. they
         talk some of Rochefort, some of Brest, &amp; others of Calais. it is sure the preparations
         are great, but the wind blows violently.
      </p>
      <p>You hear a great deal of a murther said to be committed at a Bagnio in Long Acre,
         tho' the party was carried to die at a house in Mary-bone. two of the Persons named
         as <span style="font-style:italic">of the company</span> that night are Sir William Fowler, a young Officer, &amp; one Mr Sutton, a Merchant's
         Son in the City. God knows, what truth there is in it or what was the meaning of it.
         [ ] is said to be he, [ ] was hanged up by [ ] in a silken-rope, &amp; so left hanging,
         but the W(a)iter cut him down; &amp; that all this happened the same night.
      </p>
      <p>Here is a 2d Edition of the Fragments with a new &amp; fine one added to them. you will
         perhaps soon see a very serious elegy (but this is a secret) on the death of my Lady
         Coventry. watch for it.
      </p>
      <p>If I had been aware, Mr Mapletoft was in Town, I should have return'd him the two
         Guineas I have of his. neither Osborne, nor Bathurst know, when the Book will come
         out; I will therefore pay it to any one he pleases.
      </p>

         <p>I did not mean to carry away your paper of the two pictures at Ware-Park: but I find
            I have got it here.
