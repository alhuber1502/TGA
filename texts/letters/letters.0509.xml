            <dateline>Old-Park. Sept: 11. 1767. </dateline>
            <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I admire you as the pink of perversity. how did I know about York-Races? &amp; how could I be more
					explicit about our journey. the truth is, I was only too explicit by half, for we did not set out in earnest till the 29th of August,
					being delay'd partly by the bad weather, &amp; partly by your Cousin my Lord Perrot, &amp; his
					assizes, whose train we were afraid to overtake, &amp; still more afraid of being overtaken by it. at last then we went in the sun
					&amp; dust broiling to Newcastle, &amp; so by the military road to Hexham at night, where it begun to rain, &amp; continued like fury
					(with very short intervals) all the rest of our way. so we got to Carlisle, pass'd a day there in raining &amp; seeing delights. next
					day got to Penrith (more delights) the next dined &amp; lay at Keswick, could not go a mile to see anything. Dr Wh: taken ill in the
					night with an asthma. went on however over stupendous hills to Cockermouth: here the Dr grew still worse in the night, so we came
					peppering (&amp; raining) back thro Keswick to Penrith. next day lay at Brough, grew better (raining
					still) &amp; so over Stanemoor home, Sept: 5, in a heavy thunder-shower. now you will think from this
					detail, wch is litterally true, that we had better have staid at home. no such thing! I am charm'd with my journey, &amp; the Dr dreams
					of nothing but Skiddaw, &amp; both of us vow to go again the first opportunity. I carried Mr Brown to Gibside the 11th of Aug: &amp; took a receipt for him: they did not set out for Scotland till the 1st of September,
					&amp; as yet I have not heard from him.</p>
         <p>If you are not too much afflicted for the loss of Charles Townshend, now is your time to come &amp;
					see us. in spite of your coquetry we still wish of all things to see you, &amp; (bating that vice, &amp; a few more little faults) have
					a good opinion of you, only we are afraid you have a bad heart. I have known purseproud People often complain of their poverty, wch is
					meant as an insult upon the real poor. how dare you practise this upon me? don't I know little Clough!
					here is a fuss indeed about poor threescore miles. don't I go galloping five hundred, whenever I please? have done with your tricks,
					&amp; come to Old-Park, for the peaches &amp; grapes send forth a good smell, &amp; the voice of the Robin is heard in our land. my services to Mr. Alderston, for he is a good creature: But I forget: you
					are at York again.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Adieu! I am ever <lb/> Yours </salute>

         <postscript>
            <p>The Doctor presents his compliments to you with great cordiality, &amp; desires your assistance. one of his daughters has some turn for drawing, &amp; he would wish her a little instructed in the practise. if you have any
						Professor of the art at York, that would think it worth his while to pass about six weeks here, he would be glad to receive him. his
						conditions he would learn from you. if he have any merit in his art, doubtless so much the better: but <hi rend="italic">above
							all</hi> he must be elderly, &amp; if ugly and ill-made, so much the more acceptable. the reasons we leave to your prudence.</p>
