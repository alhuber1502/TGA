         forget that I ought to have wrote before. but I have been on the Confines of that
         Land, where all Things are forgotten; &amp; return'd from thence with a Loss of Appetite
         &amp; of Spirits, that has made me a very silly Gentleman, &amp; not worth your Correspondence.
         however I am tolerable well again, &amp; came post hither on Friday<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to see my Mother [ ]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> she was then at the Extremity, but is far better at present: I have no Business to
         regale you with all [t]his,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but it is only by Way of Excuse. on Monday next I hope to return home, &amp; in my Way
         (probably on Tuesday Morning) to call at your Door, &amp; that of the Chuteheds,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if possible.</p>
      <p>I am obliged to you for transcribeing Voltaire &amp; Mr Lyttleton.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the last has six good prettyish Lines. the other I do not much admire </p>

      <p> the Thought is Martial's, &amp; many others after him; &amp; the Verses frippery enough,
         as his easy Poetry usually is. nobody loves him better than I in his grander Style.</p>
