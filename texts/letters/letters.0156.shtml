      <p>I am not dead, neither sleep I so sound, as not to feel the Jog you give me, or to
         forget that I ought to have wrote before. but I have been on the Confines of that
         Land, where all Things are forgotten; &amp; return'd from thence with a Loss of Appetite
         &amp; of Spirits, that has made me a very silly Gentleman, &amp; not worth your Correspondence.
         however I am tolerable well again, &amp; came post hither on Friday to see my Mother [
         ] she was then at the Extremity, but is far better at present: I have no Business
         to regale you with all [t]his, but it is only by Way of Excuse. on Monday next I hope
         to return home, &amp; in my Way (probably on Tuesday Morning) to call at your Door, &amp;
         that of the Chuteheds, if possible.

      <p>I am obliged to you for transcribeing Voltaire &amp; Mr Lyttleton. the last has six good
         prettyish Lines. the other I do not much admire

      <p> the Thought is Martial's, &amp; many others after him; &amp; the Verses frippery enough,
         as his easy Poetry usually is. nobody loves him better than I in his grander Style.
