         <p>God forbid that I should claim to myself the privilege you mention. That fool, young S—, at his return from Cambridge, told me
					that you had been perfectly well some time, which, of course, relieved me from all anxiety on that account. What a blessing it is to
					have a galloping imagination: I fancied you in town, with people whom you loved better, or who at least engrossed you for the time,
					hearing news, or bad operas, amused, in short, and quite thoughtless of me in my hermitage. But you was in flannel too, so I beg your
					pardon. </p>
         <p>I have returned to reading a little since my pain left me; I have run through eight centuries of Christianity in Mosheim. I am pleased with the good sense, judgment, and impartiality of the author, and with his plain manly stile;
					but that this should be a history of religion, that Monothelites, and Monophysites, and Stylites should think they were doing God
					service is wonderful! Simeon, a Syrian, was founder of the last sect, he was first a shepherd and
					then a monk, and built himself five columns, one of six cubits high, the next twelve, the next twenty-two, another thirty-six, and the
					last forty; and on these he passed thirty-seven years of his life, advancing in a progressive state upwards towards heaven. Then the
					pride and power of bishops, growing out of an humble and laborious office, totally different in its nature and intention! Patriarchs
					lording it over these, and the 'gran verme' at last devouring all. New doctrines invented every day,
					and propagated like the religion of Mahomet. The passions of men hurrying them out of sight of the true object of contention. All this,
					and thousand times more that I forget (thank Heaven) as fast as I read it, makes me wish myself at the last page; when the Reformation
						<hi rend="italic">commence à éclore,</hi> I shall apply myself to Burnet, in hopes of learning a
					little profane history to mix with my divine, which is really a bad mess by itself. I think that there is less inconvenience, after
					all, in believing as one's nurse bids one, than in resolving to understand and explain to all the world what reason was never meant to
					meddle with. 'Illa enim (says Mosheim, speaking of the fifth century,) primæ ætatis Christianæ sancta et veneranda simplicitas, quæ Deo
					loquenti credere, et mandanti obedire jubebat, præcipuis horum temporum doctoribus agrestis videbatur.' But Mosheim and Homer and all
					is at a stand now, or obliged at least to make room for Froissart. In the evening I read Rapin to my mother; so being come to Edward the Third, I took up Froissart, to keep pace with the other, and am
					so delighted that I read nothing else, 'et ay-je tant chevauché par mes journées,' that I am arrived at the peace of Bretigny. He is my historian, for he tells me all that he knows, and tells for the sake of telling, and forgets
					himself to talk of other people; which I believe is never the case for a single moment with our modern historians, who all write for
					vanity or profit, and betray their design; there is something so very appreté in all of them, and so very much the contrary in him. If
					it is owing to the simplicity of the age, and if it would not suit with the present times, I am sorry for it, for I like it much
					better. What a miserable state was France in when their king was a prisoner in England, when English
					garrisons lived at discretion in all parts of the kingdom, English armies spread desolation through every part of it, and the
						Jaquerie, to complete their misery, raged everywhere without control! I want to know whether you do
					not think Edward the First and Edward the Third's pretensions to Scotland very unjust, and a stain to their characters, when one
					considers the mischiefs they caused? and whether you think Edward the Third's pretensions to the crown of France, and the torrents of
					blood that were shed to support them, give a real lustre to his reign? and whether it was a worthy action to protest in private against
					the King of France and his title, and yet do him public homage? My brave Lord Herbert of Cherbury
					would have [ ]</p>
         <p>My friend Dr. Warner, and his very amiable wife, with Miss Allin,
					are gone this day to attempt the London road. The Dr. is prudent, and will not willingly drown himself and them; but the Yarmouth
					coach, when it has gone at all, has gone with eight horses and four postilions. A waggon and coach were overset in the water at
						Ixworth near Bury, but no mischief done. The marshes which I see from my bedchamber window are
					become an ocean. I have heard from Clarke, who has been these five months at Kylmarnock in Ayrshire,
					and stays five more: from Wheeler, who has been at Bath with his old haridan again. I have besides
					received a silly letter from Mr. Wilson, and a polite one from Dr. Gisburne, apologizing for not
					seeing me before he left Richmond, &amp;c. I have heard of Temple, who has sold some of his estate, got rid of some vexation, met with more, and is now returned to Mamhead.</p>
