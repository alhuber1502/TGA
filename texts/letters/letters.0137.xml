         <p>I could make You abundance of Excuses, as indeed I have Reason: but they would be bad &amp; false ones, such as my Respect for you
					will not permit me to use. attribute then this long Interval of Silence to whatever Motive you please besides; only don't imagine it
					Neglect, or Want of Sensibility to the many Expressions of Kindness you bestow'd upon me in your last Letter. my Sentiments are nothing
					alter'd since that Time, however tardy I may have been in telling you so: I well remember how little you love Letters, where all the
					Materials are drawn out of oneself; yet such mine must have been from a Place, where nothing ever happens but Trifles, that it would be
					mere Impertinence to think of entertaining You with. however I am apt to suspect you have been a little angry, for Dr Middleton tho'
					often with you in Town, did not bring me the least Compliment to shew you remember'd me. do you mean to continue so, or shall You see
					me the less willingly next week, when I mean to call at your Door some Morning? I hope you are still in Town.</p>
