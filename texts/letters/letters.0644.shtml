      <p class="center"><span class="hi">Pot pourri or perfumed Jar or Pot.</span></p>
      <p>Get some coarse brown Bay Salt: this is the sine quÃ¢ non, &amp; (by the way) is not to
         be had at Cambridge, where under the name of Bay Salt they sell a whitish Kind of
         Salt, that will never do for our Purpose, &amp; will spoil all: at London the true Sort
         is common in every Shop, &amp; a Pennyworth of it is enough to make a Bushel of Perfumes.
         Take a Peck of Damask Roses, pick'd from the Cups, Orange Flowers all you can get,
         Cloves (the Spice) a Quarter of an Ounce, cut small: scatter them in your Jar mixt
         in Layers about 2 Inches thick, &amp; thinly sprinkle the Salt over them: repeat this,
         'till the Vessel is three Quarters, or more, full: cover it close down, let it stand
         2 Days, &amp; then stir it up well with a wooden Ladle or Skimmer: repeat this often,
         &amp; it is made. If it is always moist to the Touch, it is right: if over-wet, you have
         only to put in more Flowers, &amp; no more Salt. You may use, if you please, Tops of Lavender,
         Myrtle-Leaves bruised, Rose-Geranium, Angelica, Shavings of Orrice-Root, or (where
         Orange Flowers are scarce) young green Oranges sliced, or even the yellow Rind of
         Seville-Oranges: but of these Things a very little will do, least they overpower the
         Rest. I can not be particular as to Quantities, because I observed none myself.</p>
