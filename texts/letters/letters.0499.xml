					       <dateline>Jermyn Street, Saturday, June 6, 1767. </dateline>
					       <salute>Dear Sir </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>My intention is (<hi rend="italic">Deo volente</hi>) to come to Cambridge on Friday or Saturday next; and shall expect to set out on
					Monday following. I shall write to Mason by to-night's post, who otherwise would expect us all Whitsun-week. Pray that the Trent may
					not intercept us at Newark, for we have had infinite rain here, and they say every brook sets up for a
					river.</p>
				     <p>I said nothing of Lady M. Lyon, because I thought you knew she had been long despaired of. The
					family I hear now do not go into Scotland till the races are over, nor perhaps then, as my lady will
					be advancing in her pregnancy, and I should not suppose the Peats or the Firth very proper in her
					condition; but women are courageous creatures when they are set upon a thing.</p>
				     <p>Lord Bute is gone ill into the country with an ague in his eye and a bad stomach. Lord Holland is alive and well, and has written three poems; the only line in which, that I have heard, is this:
				</p>
				     <q>
					       <p>'White-liver'd Grenville and self-loving Gower.'
					</p>
				     </q>
				     <p>Lord Chatham is â€”, and the Rockinghams are like the brooks that I mentioned above. This is all the news that I know.</p>
