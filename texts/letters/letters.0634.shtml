         <div class="dateline">Blundeston, May 14, 1771. </div>
      </div>
      <p>I have just received the enclosed from my poor unfortunate Temple; it is a matter
         too nice for me to meddle with without your advice; you directed my interposition
         between the same persons before,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and with good success; pity I am sure will plead more strongly with you now, because
         the case is more important. I cannot bear to see such a sacrifice to filial piety
         in the person of one whom I esteem for that and a thousand valuable qualities, and
         whom his misfortunes have made me love; his mind and constitution too are too feeble
         for such struggles. I cannot bear to see him absolutely ruined, he is now nearer than
         ever, and cannot be saved but by the help of Lord Lisburne, or some one else who is
         able to help him; if I could be the means of awakening Lord Lisburne's humanity, it
         would be the action of my life I should reflect on with most pleasure. But it is too
         delicate a matter for me to undertake unassisted, when I may hope to have the benefit
         of your wise and friendly counsels; let me entreat you to send them speedily, he is
         waiting in an anxious suspense, which, if it last long, may too easily change to despair;
         I own I dread some desperate event; the silence with which he reproaches me was only
         occasioned by my waiting daily for an answer from you; this is a matter of so much
         greater consequence, and any little delay, any suspicion of neglect in me may work
         such fatal effects in a mind subdued by distress and on the brink already of despair,
         that I hope you will answer this directly, for I shall not write to him till I receive
         your answer.</p>
      <p>I have writ to De Bonstetten to say I shall certainly be at Berne this summer, and
         that I am not without hopes of having your company thither; that, if I arrive not
         by the end of June, and he hear not again, he may conclude that I have waited for
         you, and that you come too. I have received a very civil invitation from Dr. Hallifax<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to pass some time at Trinity Hall; if (as I suspect) it is a civility which I owe
         entirely to you, I am very much obliged to you for it, but it will not be in my power
         to comply with the invitation, because I must go to town the other road and pass a
         week with my uncle<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in Essex, whose son is now visiting me on that condition. I know nothing of Wheeler,
         nor in what corner of the globe he hides himself, he was to have been here this spring,
         but he neither writes nor comes, so I am not to blame.</p>
      <p>Adieu! my heart is really full of poor Temple: you are too good to keep either him
         or me in suspense longer than is necessary.</p>
