				     <p>I am as sorry as you seem to be, that our acquaintance harped so much on the subject of materialism,
					when I saw him with you in town, because it was plain to which side of the longdebated question he inclined. That we are indeed
					mechanical and dependent beings, I need no other proof than my own feelings; and from the same feelings I learn, with equal conviction,
					that we are not <hi rend="italic">merely</hi> such: that there is a power within that struggles against the force and biass of that
					mechanism, commands its motion, and, by frequent practice, reduces it to that ready obedience which we call <hi rend="italic">Habit;</hi> and all this in conformity to a preconceived opinion (no matter whether right or wrong) to that least material of all
					agents, a Thought. I have known many in his case who, while they thought they were conquering an old prejudice, did not perceive they
					were under the influence of one far more dangerous; one that furnishes us with a ready apology for all our worst actions, and opens to
					us a full licence for doing whatever we please; and yet these very people were not at all the more indulgent to other men (as they
					naturally should have been), their indignation to such as offended them, their desire of revenge on any body that hurt them was nothing
					mitigated: In short, the truth is, they wished to be persuaded of that opinion for the sake of its convenience, but were not so in
					their heart; and they would have been glad (as they ought in common prudence) that nobody else should think the same, for fear of the
					mischief that might ensue to themselves. His French Author I never saw, but have read fifty in the same strain, and shall read no more.
					I can be wretched enough without them. They put me in mind of the Greek Sophist that got immortal
					honour by discoursing so feelingly on the miseries of our condition, that fifty of his audience went home and hanged themselves; yet he
					lived himself (I suppose) many years after in very good plight. </p>
				     <p>You say you cannot conceive how Lord Shaftesbury came to be a Philosopher in vogue; I will tell you:
					First, he was a Lord; 2dly, he was as vain as any of his readers; 3dly, men are very prone to believe what they do not understand;
					4thly, they will believe any thing at all, provided they are under no obligation to believe it; 5thly, they love to take a new road,
					even when that road leads no where; 6thly, he was reckoned a fine writer, and seemed always to mean
					more than he said. Would you have any more reasons? An interval of above forty years has pretty well
					destroyed the charm. A dead Lord ranks but with Commoners: Vanity is no longer interested in the matter, for the new road has become an
					old one. The mode of free-thinking is like that of Ruffs and Farthingales, and has given place to the mode of not thinking at all; once
					it was reckoned graceful, half to discover and half conceal the mind, but now we have been long accustomed to see it quite naked:
					primness and affectation of style, like the good breeding of Queen Ann's Court, has turned to hoydening and rude familiarity.
