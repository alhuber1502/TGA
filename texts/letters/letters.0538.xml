         <p>Where you are, I know not: but before this can reach you, I guess you will be in residence. it is only to tell you, that I profess
					modern history &amp; languages in a little shop of mine at Cambridge, if you will recommend me any
					customers. on Sunday Brocket died of a fall from his horse, drunk, I believe, &amp; (as some say) returning from Hinchinbroke. on Wednesday the D: of Grafton wrote me a very handsome letter to say, that the King <hi rend="italic">offer'd</hi> the vacant place to me, with many more speeches too honorable for me to transcribe. on Friday at the Levy I kiss'd his
					Maj:s hand. what he said, I will not tell you: because every body, that has been at Court, tells what the K: said to them: it was very
					gracious however. remember you are to say, that the Cabinet-council all approved of the nomination in a particular manner. it is hinted
					to me, that I should say this publickly, &amp; I have been at their several doors to thank them. now I have told you all the exterior,
					the rest (the most essential) you can easily guess, &amp; how it came about. now are you glad, or sorry, pray?</p>
