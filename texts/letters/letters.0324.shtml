         <div class="salute">Dear Sir, </div>
      </div>
      <p>You will not imagine me the less grateful for the long letter you were so good to
         write me some time since, because I have omitted to answer it, especially if you know
         what has since happened. Mrs. Rogers died in the end of September; and what with going
         to town to prove her will<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and other necessary things, what with returning back hither<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to pay debts, make inventories, and other such delightful amusements, I have really
         been almost wholly taken up. I might perhaps make a merit even of writing now, if
         you could form a just idea of my situation, being joint executor with another aunt,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who is of a mixed breed between â€” and the Dragon of Wantley.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> So much for her. I next proceed to tell you that I saw Mason in town, who stayed
         there a day on my account, and then set out (not in a huff) with a laudable resolution
         to pass his winter at Aston, and save a curate.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> My Lord<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has said something to him, which I am glad of, that looked like an excuse for his
         own dilatoriness in preferring him; but this is a secret. He told me he had seen you,
         and that you were well. Dr. Wharton continues dispirited, but a little better than
         he was. The first act of Caractacus is just arrived here, but I have not read it over.</p>
      <p>I am very disagreeable; but who can help that?</p>

      <div class="postscript">
         <p>I shall hardly be at Cambridge before Christmas.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I recollect that it is very possible you may have paid my bills;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if so, pray inform me what they amount to, that I may send the money when I get to
            London, or sooner, if you please.</p>
