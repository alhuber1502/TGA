         <div class="salute">Dear S<span class="super">r</span></div>
      </div>
      <p>Having been for a little while in Huntingdonshire,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on my return to this place I find a letter from you, the end of w<span class="super">ch</span> gives me much concern. I am very sorry we are at such a distance from one another,
         that it must be yet some time, before I can have any account of your health. if you
         are, as I flatter myself, recover'd, you will (I hope) do me the pleasure of letting
         me hear it without delay. if so much of your indisposition remain as to make writing
         at all troublesome to you, may I presume so far on the good-nature of Miss Swinburne,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as to beg She would give me three lines of information. this young Lady has done
         me so great an honour already, as gives me courage to apply myself to her on this
         occasion. I preserve (&amp; always shall preserve with great care) the beautiful little
         Specimen of her art, w<span class="super">ch</span> came inclosed in your letter. I am only sorry, that when I would shew &amp; make my boast
         of it to eyes, that are worthy of that satisfaction, I shall be obliged to cover a
         part of it, &amp; consequently to rob her of a part of her due praises. this is your fault
         (for I hope you did not explain the Latin inscription<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to her). however I return my thanks to you both, to Miss Sw: for all above board,
         &amp; to You, for what only I am to see.</p>
      <p>I go on (with the hope, that you are well enough to read me) to tell you, that I have
         lately received nine pages of anonymous criticism, containing a good deal both of
         praise &amp; censure on the <span class="hi">Bard</span> only. if I thought fit to hear his opinion about the other, I was to direct to A:
         B:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at a place, w<span class="super">ch</span> he told me. I have had the gratitude, or curiosity, or what you please to call it,
         to follow his direction, &amp; now I have got six pages more, &amp; his name (for that I insisted
         upon) yet am not much the wiser: however he is a Man of Letters &amp; a good sensible
         Person, &amp; depends upon no body, &amp; has a little garden. this is all, that I know about
         him.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I will not send you the <span class="hi">Sonnet</span><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you mention, but here is something else full as bad, only as it is just wrote, I
         send it you. it is an epitaph on the Wife of a Friend<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of mine.</p>
      <div class="q">Lo, where this little<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Marble weeps,<br /> A Friend, a Wife, a Mother sleeps,<br /> A Heart, within whose sacred cell<br /> Each peaceful Virtue<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> lov'd to dwell,<br /> Affection warm, &amp; Faith sincere,<br /> And soft Humanity, were there.<br /> To hide her Cares her only art,<br /> Her pleasure pleasures to impart.<br /> In ling'ring pain, in death resign'd,<br /> Her latest agony of mind<br /> Was felt for him, who could not save<br /> His All from an untimely grave:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><br /> Whom what awaits, while yet he strays<br /> Along the lonely vale of days?<br /> A pang to silent<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Sorrow dear,<br /> A sigh, an unavailing tear,<br /> Till Time shall ev'ry grief remove<br /> With life, with mem'ry, &amp; with love.</div>
      <div class="closer">
         <div class="salute">Adieu, dear S<span class="super">r</span>. be well, or you will think this letter very impertinent I am<br /> Your Friend &amp; Servant</div>
