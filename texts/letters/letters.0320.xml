            <salute>Dear Doctor </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I ought to have informed you sooner, that I had received the Ticket you were so good to buy for me,
					but I have been obliged to go every day almost to Stoke-house, where the Garricks have been all the
					last week. they are now gone, &amp; I am not sorry for it, for I grow so old, that, I own, People in high spirits &amp; gayety
					overpower me, &amp; entirely take away mine. I can yet be diverted with their sallies, but if they appear to take notice of my
					dullness, it sinks me to nothing. I do not know, whether you will blame me, but I found so good an opportunity given me of entering
					into the quarrel between M: and him, that I could not help seizing it, &amp; trying to shew him the
					folly of hearkening to half-witted friends &amp; tale-bearers; and the greater folly of attempting to hurt, or merely to pique, so
					worthy &amp; so estimable a Man. if I did nothing else, I at least convinced him, that I spoke entirely from myself; &amp; that I had
					the most entire good opinion &amp; most unalterable respect as well as kindness for M:n.</p>
         <p>I congratulate you on our successes, &amp; condole with you on our misfortunes: but do you think we
					draw the nearer to any happy conclusion of the war, or that we can bear so great a burthen much longer. the K: of Prussia's situation
					embarrasses me, surrounded as he is, &amp; reduced to the defence of his own little Marquisate.
				</p>
         <p>Your Encyclopedie is the object of my envy. I am reduced to French plays &amp; novels, Willis's
					mitred Abbies, &amp; the History of Norfolk in 3 volumes Folio. these
					latter Authors have, I think, the most wit, tho' the others know rather more of the World.</p>
         <p>I wish the air of Hampstead were not so necessary to you all, but am glad you always know where to find health, &amp; that she lives so near you. I continue better than has been usual for me in the summer, tho' I neither walk, nor take
					any thing: 'tis in mind only, that I am weary &amp; disagreeable. Mrs R: is declining every day, her
					stomach gone, very weak, sometimes giddy, &amp; subject to disorders in her bowels: yet I do not apprehend any immediate danger, but
					believe she will be reduced to keep her bed entirely.</p>
         <p>My best compliments to Mrs Wharton. pray let me hear from you as often as you are in a humour for writing, tho' from hence I can
					requite your kindness with so little to amuse you.</p>
