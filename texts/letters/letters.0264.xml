				     <p> Tho' I do not know whether you are yet return'd from Bath, I can not help addressing this to York
					(for where else can I find you?) &amp; enquiring after your health, especially as I recollect, you told me you were but lately
					recover'd from a fit of illness, when I had the pleasure of seeing you. I have too numberless excuses
					to make for the very free &amp; unceremonious reception I then gave you, &amp; the many liberties I took with you in the first
					conversation we ever had. perhaps there is no other excuse to be made for them, than that I then regarded you as a Person I had long
					known, &amp; one, to whom I might speak my mind, without danger of offending you. I should be glad to know, where you are, what you are
					doing, &amp; even what you are thinking of? if you are at home, I beg you would present my respects to the Ladies, &amp; believe me</p>
