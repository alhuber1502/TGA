      <body>
         <p>Your pen was too rapid to mind the common form of a direction, and so, by omitting the words <hi rend="italic">near Windsor,</hi>
					your letter has been diverting itself at another Stoke, near Ailesbury, and came not to my hands till
					to-day. The true original chairs were all sold, when the Huntingdons broke; there are nothing now but
						Halsey-chairs, not adapted to the squareness of a Gothic dowager's rump. And by the way I do not see
					how the uneasiness and uncomfortableness of a coronation-chair can be any objection with you: every chair that is easy is modern, and
					unknown to our ancestors. As I remember, there were certain low chairs, that looked like ebony, at Esher, and were old and pretty. Why should not Mr. Bentley improve upon them?â€“ I do not wonder at
						Dodsley. You have talked to him of six <hi rend="italic">odes,</hi> for so you are pleased to call
					every thing I write, though it be but a receipt to make apple-dumplings. He has reason to gulp when he finds one of them only a long
						story. I don't know but I may send him very soon (by your hands) an ode to his own tooth, a high
					Pindarick upon stilts, which one must be a better scholar than he is to understand a line of, and the
					very best scholars will understand but a little matter here and there. It wants but seventeen lines of having an end, I don't say of
					being finished. As it is so unfortunate to come too late for Mr. Bentley, it may appear in the fourth volume of the
						Miscellanies, provided you don't think it execrable, and suppress it. Pray, when the fine book is to
					be printed, let me revise the press, for you know you can't; and there are a few trifles I could wish
					altered.</p>
         <p>I know not what you mean by hours of love, and cherries, and pine-apples. I neither see nor hear
					anything here, and am of opinion that is the best way. My compliments to Mr. Bentley, if he be with you. </p>

            <p>I desire you would not show that epigram I repeated to you, as mine. I have heard of it twice already as coming from you.
