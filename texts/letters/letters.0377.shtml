      </div>
      <p>It is not good to give copies of a thing, before you have given it the last hand.
         if you would send it to Ld H:, you might have spared that to Lady M: C:; they have
         both shew'd it to particular friends, &amp; so it is half-publish'd before it is finish'd.
         I begin again from the beginning
      </p>
      <p>Ah mark) is rather languid. I would read <span style="font-style:italic">Heard ye?</span></p>
      <p>V: 3.) I read: and now <span style="font-style:italic">with</span> rising knell. to avoid two <span style="font-style:italic">the</span>'s.
      </p>
      <p>V: 10.) I read, – since now <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> bloom &amp;c:
      </p>
      <p>V: 11, 12.) Are alter'd for the better, &amp; so are the following, but for <span style="font-style:italic">Liquid Light'ning,</span> Ld J: C: says, there is a Dram, wch goes by that name; &amp; T: G: adds, that the words
         are stolen from a Sonnet of the late Prince of Wales's. what if we read liquid <span style="font-style:italic">radiance,</span> &amp; change the word <span style="font-style:italic">radiant</span> soon after?
      </p>
      <p>V: 18. Read, <span style="font-style:italic">That</span> o'er her form &amp;c:
      </p>
      <p>V: 23. Cease, <span style="font-style:italic">cease, Luxuriant Muse;</span> tho' mended, it is still weakly. I do not much care for any Muse at all here.
      </p>
      <p>V: 26. <span style="font-style:italic">Mould'ring</span> is better than <span style="font-style:italic">clay-cold.</span> somewhat else might be better perhaps than either.
      </p>
      <p>V: 35. <span style="font-style:italic">Whirl you in her wild career.</span> this image does not come in so well here between two real happinesses. the word <span style="font-style:italic">lead</span> before it, as there is no epithet left to <span style="font-style:italic">purple,</span> is a little faint.
      </p>
      <p>Of her <span style="font-style:italic">choicest</span> stores an <span style="font-style:italic">ampler</span> share, seems to me prosaick.
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Zenith-height</span> is harsh to the ear, &amp; too scientific.
      </p>
      <p>I take it the interrogation-point comes after <span style="font-style:italic">fresh delight,</span> &amp; there the sense ends. if so, the Question is too long in asking, &amp; leaves a sort
         of obscurity.
      </p>
      <p>V: 46. I understand, but can not read this line. does <span style="font-style:italic">tho' soon</span> belong to <span style="font-style:italic">lead her hence,</span> or to, <span style="font-style:italic">the Steps were slow</span>? I take it, to the latter; &amp; if so, it is hardly Grammar. if to the former, the end
         of the line appears very naked without it.
      </p>
      <p>V: 55. <span style="font-style:italic">Rouse</span> then – <span style="font-style:italic">his voice pursue.</span> I do not like this broken line.
      </p>
      <p>V: 74. <span style="font-style:italic">Firm as</span> the Sons – that is, <span style="font-style:italic">as firmly as.</span> the adjective used for the adverb here gives it some obscurity, &amp; has the appearance
         of a contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>V: 76. A less metaphorical line would become this place better. </p>
      <p>V: 80. This, tho' a good line, would be better too, if it were more simple, for the
         same figure is amplified in the following Stanza, &amp; there is no occasion for anticipating
         it here. 
      </p>
      <p>V: 85. <span style="font-style:italic">And why</span> – I do not understand. you mean, I imagine, that the Warrior must not expect to establish
         his fame, as a Heroe, while he is yet alive. but how does <span style="font-style:italic">living Fame</span> signify this? the construction too is not good, if you mean, <span style="font-style:italic">with regard to Fame, while he yet lives, Fate denies him that.</span> the next line is a bold expression of Shakespear. the 3d, <span style="font-style:italic">E'er from her trump–heav'n breath'd</span>–is not good.
      </p>
      <p>V: 89. <span style="font-style:italic">Is it the grasp</span> – You will call me a Coxcomb, if I remind you, that this stanza in the turn of it
         is too like a stanza of <span style="font-style:italic">another body's.</span> 
      </p>
      <p>V: 98. <span style="font-style:italic">Truth ne'er can sanctify</span> – is an indifferent line. both Mr Brown &amp; I have some doubt about the justness of
         this sentiment. a Kingdom is purchased (we think) too dear with the life of any Man;
         &amp; this no less, if there <span style="font-style:italic">be a life hereafter,</span> than if there be none.
      </p>
      <p>V: 102. We say, the juice of the grape <span style="font-style:italic">mantles,</span> but not the grape.
      </p>
      <p>V: 107. By earth's poor pittance–will not do. the end is very well, but the whole
         is rather too long, &amp; I would wish it reduced a little in the latter part. 
      </p>
      <p>I am sorry you went so soon out of Town, because you lost your share in his Majesty's
         reproof to his Chaplains. 'I desire, <span style="font-style:italic">those Gentlemen</span> may be told, that I come here to praise God, &amp; not to hear my own praises.' Kitt
         Wilson was (I think) the Person, that had been preaching. this, &amp; another thing I
         have been told, give me great hopes of the young Man. Fobus was asking him, what Sum
         it was his pleasure should be laid out on the next Election? Nothing, my Lord (the
         Duke stared, &amp; said, Sr!) Nothing, I say, my Ld: I desire to be tried by my Country.
      </p>
      <p>There has been as great confusion this week, as if the French were landed. you see,
         the Heads of the Tories are invited into the bed-chamber, &amp; Mr P: avows it to be his
         advice, not as to the particular Men, but the measure. Fobus knew nothing of it, till
         it was done, &amp; has talked loudly for two days of resigning; Ld H:k &amp; his People say,
         they will support the whig-interest, as if all was going to ruin, &amp; they hoped to
         raise a party. what will come of it, is doubtful; but I fancy, they will acquiesce,
         &amp; stay in as long as they can. great confusion in the army too about Ld Fitzmaurice,
         who is put over the head of Ld G: Lenox, Mr Fitzroy, &amp; also of almost all the American
         Officers.
      </p>
      <p>I have seen Mr Southwell, &amp; approve him much. he has got many new tastes &amp; knowledges,
         &amp; is no more a cockscomb than when he went from hence. I am glad to hear you bode
         so well of Ponsonby &amp; his Tutor. here is a delightful new Woman in the Burlettas,
         the rest is all Bartholomew &amp; his Fair. Elisi has been ill eversince he came, &amp; has
         not sung yet.
