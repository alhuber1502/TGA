      <p>Mason being in residence at York, I lay aside my first design of going obliquely to
         Aston, &amp; thence to Keswick; &amp; set out with Mr Brown<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> tomorrow the common northern road. we shall probably pass two or three days at York,
         &amp; then come to Old-Park. about the end of August we may cross the Apennine, &amp; visit
         M: Skiddaw, when Mason may accompany or meet us on our way, &amp; so you drop me there
         to find my way thro' the deserts of Lancashire in my return homewards.</p>
      <p>I am so fat, that I have suffer'd more from heat this last fortnight, than ever I
         did in Italy. the Thermom: usually at 75, &amp; (in the sun) at 116. my respects to Mrs
         Wh: &amp; the family.</p>
