					       <dateline>Rome, April 15, 1740. Good Friday. </dateline>
				     </opener>
				     <p>To-day I am just come from paying my adoration at St. Peter's to three extraordinary reliques, which are exposed to public view only
					on these two days in the whole year, at which time all the confraternities in the city come in procession to see them. It was something
					extremely novel to see that vast church, and the most magnificent in the world, undoubtedly, illuminated (for it was night) by
					thousands of little crystal lamps, disposed in the figure of a huge cross at the high altar, and seeming to hang alone in the air. All
					the light proceeded from this, and had the most singular effect imaginable as one entered the great door. Soon after came one after
					another, I believe, thirty processions, all dressed in linen frocks, and girt with a cord, their heads covered with a cowl all over,
					only two holes to see through left. Some of them were all black, others red, others white, others party-coloured; these were
					continually coming and going with their tapers and crucifixes before them; and to each company, as they arrived and knelt before the
					great altar, were shown from a balcony at a great height, the three wonders, which are, you must know, the head of the spear that
					wounded Christ; St. Veronica's handkerchief, with the miraculous impression of his face upon it; and a piece of the true cross, on the
					sight of which the people thump their breasts, and kiss the pavement with vast devotion. The tragical part of the ceremony is half a
					dozen wretched creatures, who with their faces covered, but naked to the waist, are in a side-chapel disciplining themselves with
					scourges full of iron prickles; but really in earnest, as our eyes can testify, which saw their backs and arms so raw we should have
					taken it for a red satin doublet torn, and shewing the skin through, had we not been convinced of the contrary by the blood which was
					plentifully sprinkled about them. It is late; I give you joy of Port-Bello, and many other things, which I hope are all true. [...]</p>
