      <p>The title-page will probably suffice you; but if you would know any more of him, he
         has read nothing but the common chronicles, and those without attention: for example,
         speaking of Anne the queen, he says, she was <span style="font-style:italic">barren,</span> of which Richard had often complained to Rotheram. He extenuates the murder of Henry
         VI. and his son: the first, he says, might be a malicious accusation, for that many
         did suppose he died of mere melancholy and grief: the latter cannot be proved to be
         the action of Richard (though executed in his presence); and if it were, he did it
         out of love to his brother Edward. He justifies the death of the lords at Pomfret,
         from reasons of state, for his own preservation, the safety of the commonwealth, and
         the ancient nobility. The execution of Hastings he excuses from necessity, from the
         dishonesty and sensuality of the man: what was his crime with respect to Richard,
         he does not say. Dr. Shaw's sermon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was not by the king's command, but to be imputed to the preacher's own ambition:
         but if it was by order, <span style="font-style:italic">to charge his mother with adultery was a matter of no such great moment, since it
            is no wonder in that sex.</span> Of the murder in the Tower he doubts; but if it were by his order, the offence was
         to God, not to his people; and <span style="font-style:italic">how could he demonstrate his love more amply, than to venture his soul for their quiet?</span> Have you enough, pray? You see it is an idle declamation, the exercise of a school-boy
         that is to be bred a statesman.</p>
      <p>I have looked in Stowe: to be sure there is no proclamation<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there. Mr. Hume, I suppose, means <span style="font-style:italic">Speed,</span> where it is given, how truly I know not; but that he had seen the original is sure,
         and seems to quote the very words of it in the beginning of that speech which Perkin
         makes to James IV. and also just afterwards, where he treats of the Cornish rebellion.</p>
      <p>Guthrie, you see, has vented himself in the Critical Review.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> His History I never saw, nor is it here, nor do I know any one that ever saw it.
         He is a rascal, but rascals may chance to meet with curious records; and that commission
         to sir J. Tyrrell<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (if it be not a lye) is such: so is the order for Henry the sixth's funeral. I would
         by no means take notice of him, write what he would. I am glad you have seen the Manchester-roll.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>It is not I that talk of Phil. de Comines; it was mentioned to me as a thing that
         looked like a voluntary omission: but I see you have taken notice of it in the note
         to p. 71,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> though rather too slightly. You have not observed that the same writer says, c. 55,
         <span style="font-style:italic">Richard tua de sa main, ou fit tuer en sa presence, quelque lieu apart, ce bon homme
            le roi Henry.</span> Another oversight I think there is at p. 43, where you speak of the <span style="font-style:italic">roll of parliament</span> and the contract with lady Eleanor Boteler,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as things newly come to light; whereas Speed has given at large the same roll in
         his History.</p>
