         <p>I ought sooner to have thank'd you for the <hi rend="italic">reverend</hi> Packet you were so good to convey to me. it was (as you guess'd) nine pages of criticism written with much freedom, full of rough (&amp; sometimes
					ill-grounded) censures, but season'd with high-flow'n compliments. it is all about the Bard alone: if I think it worth my while to
					hear, what he has to say about the other ode, I am told to direct to A: B: inclosed to the Post-Master at Andover. after what I have
					said, you will think it strange, that I have thought it worth while to write a line to this A: B:; nevertheless I have done so, for it
					is a merit with me, that he has taken the pains to read &amp; certainly does understand me, tho' his judgement about what he reads is
					not always superlative. I have taken the liberty to desire, he would direct his packet as before, wch
					I hope You will forgive, as I am ever</p>
