         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>I am just come to Town, where I shall stay six weeks or more, &amp; (if you will send
         your dimensions) will look out for papers<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at the shops. I own I never yet saw any Gothic papers<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to my fancy. there is one fault, that is in the nature of the thing, &amp; can not be
         avoided. the great beauty of all Gothick designs is the variety of perspectives they
         occasion. this a Painter may represent on the walls of a room in some measure; but
         not a Designer of Papers, where, what is represented on one breadth, must be exactly
         repeated on another, both in the light &amp; shade, and in the dimensions. this we can
         not help; but they do not even do what they might: they neglect Hollar,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to copy Mr. Halfpenny's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> architecture, so that all they do is more like a goosepie than a cathedral. you seem
         to suppose, that they do Gothic papers in colours, but I never saw any but such as
         were to look like Stucco:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> nor indeed do I conceive that they could have any effect or meaning. lastly, I never
         saw any thing of gilding, such as you mention, on paper, but we shall see. only pray
         leave as little to my judgement as possible.</p>
      <p>I thank'd Dr Ashton before you told me to do so. he writes me word, that (except the
         first Sunday of a month) he believes, he shall be at Eton till the middle of November;
         &amp; (as he now knows the person in question is your nephew)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> adds, I remember Dr Wharton with great pleasure, &amp; beg you will signify as much to
         him, when you write.</p>
      <p>The King is just married,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is the hottest night in the year.</p>
