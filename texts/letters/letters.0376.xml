         <p>I send you the Elegy, You will find I have alterd all the things you mark'd and some perhaps I have
					improvd. Mr Wood thinks the conclusion equal enough to the rest, therefore I have venturd to send a
					Copy to Lord Holdernesse. But I hope to have your scratches upon that part also soon. I wish you would let your Servant take a Copy and
					send it to Mr Brown to whom I talked about it. When I was at Cambridge I saw a great deal of Onley,
					&amp; am very sanguine in my hopes that his Pupillage will not turn out ill. Dr Axton came down when
					I was there &amp; entertaind us much with his Beaver &amp; Camblet surtout. Do write to me soon &amp; promise yourself that Ill be as
					regular a Correspondent for the future as I have always been</p>
