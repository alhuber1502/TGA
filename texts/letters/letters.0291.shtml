         <div class="salute">Dear S<span class="super">r</span></div>
      </div>
      <p>For the opinion of the South I refer you to the lordly conversation you were present
         at in the Bookseller's shop during York races.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> we are almost all Lords, &amp; the commonest events of English History are to us impenetrable
         &amp; inexplicable: however here were some different judgements. you saw the verses printed
         in the London Chronicle, &amp; supposed to be M<span class="super">r</span> Garrick's;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and (to make you friends with D<span class="super">r</span> Warburton) I must tell you, he says, the World never judged so justly of any thing
         new, as of these Odes, for other compositions they have affected to like &amp; dislike,
         but these they own they do not understand; &amp; he heartily believes them: yet he does
         not doubt but they understand them full as well as Milton or Shakespeare, w<span class="super">ch</span> Fashion forces them to admire, this is what my Correspondents tell me, &amp; if they
         have put in a little more flattery, than belongs to the Doctor, I know you will excuse
         me for biting at it so readily. Dodsley, I find, has been as negligent with regard
         to several other Persons, as to you, but it is in vain to scold at a Bookseller, when
         your writings lie upon his hands by hundreds, as (I suppose) mine do. you see what
         my <span class="hi">celebrity</span> (that you promised me) is come to. pray, don't tell the People of Durham, to whom
         I am infinitely obliged, tho' they did not at all like me. there are some objections
         to the tradition you flatter me with:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Churchyard was publish'd Feb: 1751, &amp; I did not go thither<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> till Aug: 1753. I met with no weather, that would tempt me to sit under a tree; 3<span class="super">dly</span> &amp; lastly, they have no trees to sit under.</p>
      <p>I have got the old Ballad, on w<span class="super">ch</span> Douglas is founded.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is in my eyes a miracle not only of ancient simplicity, but of ancient art. the
         great rules of Aristotle &amp; Horace are observed in it by a Writer, who perhaps had
         never heard their names. what I say, is a great compliment to the Genius of the Scotch,
         but a still greater to Horace &amp; Aristotle. as to the Play, the single Scene of Matilda's
         interview with the old Peasant was the thing, that inchanted me; if all the rest had
         been wrote by Aaron Hill,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I should have been still inchanted. pray keep yourâ&#x80;&#x94;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>you know whatâ&#x80;&#x94;from interfering with your judgement in poetry. nothing belongs to
         this, but what Men say, &amp; what they do in different situations of life; not what they
         <span class="hi">ought</span> to say or do. I wish to God, that no good Man, or even no <span class="hi">good Christian</span>, had ever known what despair was: but I fear they have too often been hurried to
         their own destruction. Providence may have interposed to prevent it, but whether it
         does <span class="hi">always</span> interpose, only that Providence can tell. however this is <span class="hi">gratis dictum</span>, for Matilda is distracted, before she executes her purpose. another quarrel I have
         with you about Q: Elizabeth. I know she was a <span class="hi">Bitch</span>; but it is clear, on what your animosity is founded. indeed it runs in the blood.
         I suppose your ancestor S<span class="super">r</span> H: B:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> many a time repented, that when he was her Keeper, he had not put a little in her
         cup of what she herself wish'd S<span class="super">r</span> Amias Paulet<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> would put into that of Mary, Q: of Scots. before you offer to condemn her persecutions,
         let me know, what you think of those of her Sister Mary. believe me this topick of
         hanging &amp; burning is a thing, that no good Catholick ought ever to open his mouth
         about, till the measure on our Side is as full, as it is on yours. if you tell your
         Confessor this, he will enjoin you never to write to me more.</p>
