         <div class="salute">Dear Sir </div>
      </div>
      <p>I observed that Ansel<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> was dead, and made the same reflection about it that you did. I also wrote to remind
         N:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of it, but have heard nothing since. We have great scarcity of news here. Everything
         is in Lord Ch.'s<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> breast. If what lies hid there be no better than what comes to light, I would not
         give sixpence to know it. Spain was certainly offered to Lord Weymouth,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and in the second place, some say to Sandwich; at last, perhaps, Sir James Gray<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> may go. But who goes Secretary<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> do you think? I leave Mr. T.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and you ten guesses a-piece, and yet they will be all wrong. Mr. Prowse<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has refused the Post Office. I do not believe in any more dukes,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> unless, perhaps, my Lord Marquis of Rockingham should like it. The Prince of Wales
         has been ill of what they call a fever. They say he is better, but Sir J. Pringle<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> continues to lie every night at Kew. My Lady Ã¢&#x80;&#x94; has discarded Thynne<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and taken to Sir T. Delaval,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> they say. The clothes are actually making, but possibly she may jilt them both. The
         clerk who was displaced in the Post Office lost 1,700<span style="font-style:italic">l</span> a year. Would you think there could be such under-offices there? Have you read Mr.
         Grenville's Considerations<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on the merits of his own Administration? It is all figures; so, I suppose, it must
         be true. Have you read Mr. Sharp the surgeon's Travels into Italy?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I recommend these two authors to you instead of Livy and Quintilian.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Palgrave, I suppose, you have by this time seen and sifted; if not, I must tell you,
         his letter was dated from Glamis, 30th Sept., Tuesday night. He was that day returned
         from my tour in the Highlands, delighted with their beauties, though he saw the Alps
         last year. The Friday following he was to set out for Hetton,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> where his stay would not be long; then pass four days at Newby,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and as much at York, and so to Cambridge, where, ten to one, he has not yet arrived.
         Tom<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> outstripped Lord Panmure<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> at the county court at Forfar all to nothing. Dr. Richmond<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is body chaplain to the Duke of Athol, lives at Dunkeld,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and eats muir-fowls' livers every day. If you know this already, who can help it?</p>
      <p>Pray tell me, how do you do; and let me know the sum total of my bill.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>

         <p>Commend me to Mr. Talbot and Dr. Gisborne. Delaval is coming to you. Is Mr. Mapletoft
