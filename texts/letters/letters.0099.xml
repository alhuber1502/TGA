				     <p>I am to-day just returned from Alba, a good deal fatigued; for you know the Appian is somewhat
					tiresome. We dined at Pompey's; he indeed was gone for a few days to his Tusculan, but, by the care of
					his Villicus, we made an admirable meal. We had the dugs of a pregnant sow, a peacock, a dish of thrushes, a noble scarus just fresh
					from the Tyrrhene, and some conchylia of the Lake with garum sauce: For my part I never eat better at Lucullus's table. We drank half a
					dozen cyathi a-piece of ancient Alban to Pholoë's health; and, after bathing, and playing an hour at
					ball, we mounted our essedum again, and proceeded up the mount to the temple. The priests there entertained us with an account of a
					wonderful shower of birds eggs, that had fallen two days before, which had no sooner touched the ground, but they were converted into
					gudgeons; as also that the night past a dreadful voice had been heard out of the Adytum, which spoke Greek during a full half hour, but
					no body understood it. But quitting my Romanities, to your great joy and mine, let me tell you, in plain English, that we come from
					Albano. The present town lies within the inclosure of Pompey's Villa in ruins. The Appian way runs through it, by the side of which, a
					little farther, is a large old tomb, with five pyramids upon it, which the learned suppose to be the burying-place of the family,
					because they do not know whose it can be else. But the vulgar assure you it is the sepulchre of the Curiatii, and by that name (such is
					their power) it goes. One drives to Castel Gondolfo, a house of the Pope's, situated on the top of one of the Collinette, that forms a
					brim to the bason, commonly called the Alban lake. It is seven miles round; and directly opposite to you, on the other side, rises the
					Mons Albanus, much taller than the rest, along whose side are still discoverable (not to common eyes) certain little ruins of the old
					Alba longa. They had need be very little, as having been nothing but ruins ever since the days of Tullus Hostilius. On its top is a
					house of the Constable Colona's, where stood the temple of Jupiter Latialis. At the foot of the hill Gondolfo, are the famous outlets
					of the lake, built with hewn stone, a mile and a half under ground. Livy, you know, amply informs us of the foolish occasion of this
						expence, and gives me this opportunity of displaying all my erudition, that I may appear considerable
					in your eyes. This is the prospect from one window of the palace. From another you have the whole Campagna, the City, Antium, and the
					Tyrrhene sea (twelve miles distant) so distinguishable, that you may see the vessels sailing upon it. All this is charming. Mr. Walpole
					says, our memory sees more than our eyes in this country. Which is extremely true; since, for realities, Windsor, or Richmond Hill, is
					infinitely preferable to Albano or Frescati. I am now at home, and going to the window to tell you it is the most beautiful of Italian
					nights, which, in truth, are but just begun (so backward has the spring been here, and every where else, they say.) There is a moon!
					there are stars for you! Do not you hear the fountain? Do not you smell the orange flowers? That building yonder is the Convent of S.
					Isidore; and that eminence, with the cypress trees and pines upon it, the top of M. Quirinal. This is all true, and yet my prospect is
					not two hundred yards in length. We send you some Roman inscriptions to entertain you. The first two are modern, transcribed from the
					Vatican library by Mr. Walpole. </p>
