      <p>I am obliged to you for your enquiries after me. I am indeed not well, tho' recover'd
         in a great degree, &amp; able to go about as usual. it will be about a fortnight, before
         I can come to Town: therefore if Ld Herbert should be ripe within a week or ten days,
         I could wish to see him at Cambridge, for I am impatient to be better acquainted with
         him, &amp; by this long delay should expect additions to the Manuscript, tho' of what
         kind I can not imagine.
