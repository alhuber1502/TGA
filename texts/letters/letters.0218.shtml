         <div class="salute">Dear Sr</div>
      </div>
      <p>I am very glad my objections serve only to strengthen your first opinion about the
         subject of your picture:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if I casually meet with any thing more, I shall send it you. the reason I trouble
         you at present is to tell you, that I have got into my hands the Dugdale Mr Chute
         enquired after.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> a great number of the arms are blazon'd in the margin, not very neatly, but (I suppose)
         they are authentic; tho' in it I find written in an old hand</p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>This volume no Errata's has; <br /> The Whole may for Errata's pass. <br /> If to correct them you intend, <br /> You'll find it labour without end. <br /> 'Tis therefore better let them goe. <br /> God only 'tis knows, who gets who.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Whether this is wit only, or a censure upon Dugdale's work, or upon the Heraldry added
         to it, I leave you to judge. the arms were done by a Sergeant-Surgeon to K: Charles
         2d, who made this art his particular Study, &amp; the book belongs to Caius-College.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you are desired to send your queries forthwith, for I can not keep it a great while.</p>
      <p>I return you thanks for the civilities you have shew'd Mason, who is here, &amp; speaks
         much of your politeness to him.</p>
