            <salute>Dear Sr </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I hope to send you the first intelligence of the church preferments, tho' such is your eagerness there for this sort of news, that perhaps mine may be stale before it can reach you. Drummond is Ap of
					York, Hayter Bp of London, Young of Norwich, Newton of Bristol with the Residentp of St Paul's, Thomas goes to Salisbury,
					Greene (of Ben'et) to Lincoln, James Yorke succeeds to his
					Deanery.</p>
         <p>As to the Queene why you have all seen her, what need I tell you that she is thin, and not tall,
					fine clear light brown hair (not very light neither) very white teeth, mouth Ã¢&#x80;&#x94;, nose strait
					and well formed, turned up a little at the end, nostrils rather wide, complexion a little inclining to yellow, but little colour; dark
					and not large eyes, hand and arm not perfect, very genteel motions, great spirits, and much conversation. She speaks French very
					correctly. This is all I know, but do not cite me for it.
				</p>
         <p>Mason is come, but I have not seen him: he walks at the Coronation. I shall see the shew, but
					whether in the Hall, or only the Procession I do not know yet. It is believed places will be cheap.</p>
         <closer>
            <salute> Adieu.</salute>
