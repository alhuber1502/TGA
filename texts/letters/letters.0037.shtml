   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>I congratulate you on your being about to leave college,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and rejoice much you carry no degrees with you. For I would not have had You dignified,
         and I not, for the world, you would have insulted me so. My eyes, such as they are,
         like yours, are neither metaphysical nor mathematical; I have, nevertheless, a great
         respect for your connoisseurs that way, but am always contented to be their humble
         admirer. Your collection of desolate animals<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> pleased me much; but Oxford, I can assure you, has her owls that match yours, and
         the prophecy has certainly a squint that way. Well, you are leaving this dismal land
         of bondage, and which way are you turning your face? Your friends, indeed, may be
         happy in you, but what will you do with your classic companions? An inn of court is
         as horrid a place as a college, and a moot case is as dear to gentle dulness<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as a syllogism. But wherever you go, let me beg you not to throw poetry 'like a nauseous
         weed away': Cherish its sweets in your bosom, they will serve you now and then to
         correct the disgusting sober follies<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> of the common law, misce stultitiam consiliis brevem, dulce est desipere in loco;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> so said Horace to Virgil, those sons of Anac in poetry, and so say I to you, in this
         degenerate land of pigmies,</p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>Mix with your grave designs a little pleasure, <br /> Each day of business has its hour of leisure.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In one of these hours I hope, dear sir, you will sometimes think of me, write to me,
         and know me yours,</p>

      <p>that is, write freely to me and openly, as I do to you, and to give you a proof of
         it I have sent you an elegy of Tibullus<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> translated. Tibullus, you must know, is my favourite elegiac poet; for his language
         is more elegant and his thoughts more natural than Ovid's. Ovid excells him only in
         wit, of which no poet had more in my opinion. The reason I choose so melancholy a
         kind of poesie, is because my low spirits and constant ill health (things in me not
         imaginary, as you surmise, but too real, alas! and, I fear, constitutional) 'have
         tuned my heart to elegies of woe'; and this likewise is the reason why I am the most
         irregular thing alive at college, for you may depend upon it I value my health above
         what they call discipline. As for this poor unlicked thing of an elegy, pray criticise
         it unmercifully, for I send it with that intent. Indeed your late translation of Statius<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> might have deterred me, but I know you are not more able to excell others, than you
         are apt to forgive the want of excellence, especially when it is found in the productions
         of</p>
