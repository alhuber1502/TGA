					       <dateline>July 10, 1764. Cambr: </dateline>
					       <salute>My Dear Doctor</salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p> I do remember &amp; shall ever remember, as I ought, your extreme kindness in offering to be present, &amp; to assist me in the <hi rend="italic">perilous hour.</hi> when I received your letter, I was pleased to find, I had done every thing almost, that you advised.
					the fault lay in deferring matters too long. upon inspection they found no reason to apprehend a Fistula, but the piles only in an
					extreme degree, that threaten'd mortification. 9 or 10 strokes of the lancet, &amp; the application of a caustic, with fomentations
					innumerable I suffer'd manfully: indeed the pain in idea is much greater than in reality, &amp; now I am glad, I know it. it is
					certain, I am better at present, than I had been in at least a year before the operation. I should tell you, that for some days before
					I submitted to it, I had taken soap in large quantities, &amp; for ought I know the inflammation might be rather increased by it. Dr.
						Whytt (I remember) speaking of the use of Limewater &amp; Soap, says, that if the Patient be subject
					to the piles, he must omitt the latter. towards the end of my confinement, during wch (you may believe) I lived on nothing, came the
					Gout in one foot, but so tame you might have stroked it; such a <hi rend="italic">Minikin</hi>
					 you might have play'd with it. in 3 or 4 days it disappear'd.</p>
				     <p>It was true, as Stonhewer told you, that I had a great tendency towards Old-Park &amp; Hart-le-pool: but on prudent consideration I
					find, I can not well afford it, &amp; must defer that pleasure to another summer. the Minikin &amp; I
					act upon the same principles: she can not be a river, nor I a Traveller, without money. if we had but a <hi rend="italic">head,</hi> we
					should both of us make a figure in the world.</p>
				     <p>Mason does not seem very impatient, for he writes word, that he is busy in modelling antique vases
					in clay, &amp; in reading a course of ecclesiastical History, when I expected <hi rend="italic">consummation,</hi> &amp; was praying
					heaven to give him a good &amp; gentle Gouverness: no Man wants such a thing more in all senses; but his greatest wants do not make him
					move a foot the faster, nor has he properly speaking any thing one can call a passion about him, except a little malice &amp;
					revenge.</p>
				     <p>Our Election here is in Westminster-Hall: but it is not likely that any great matter can be done in
					it till Michaelmas-Term next. in the meantime Ld Sandw: &amp; his Friends do what they can to keep up an interest &amp; a bustle. here
					is a poor Scribler, that he hires to write a weekly paper call'd <hi rend="italic">the Scrutator,</hi>
					 who by abuse of characters does all in his power to provoke people: but can not so much as get
					himself answer'd. I could not find any one in Town, that ever heard of it (tho' the subject is well known there), &amp; if any body saw
					its name in the advertisements, I believe, they only took it for a <hi rend="italic">Scrutore</hi> to be sold. the Nation is in the
					same hands as the University, &amp; really does not make so manful a resistance. grumble indeed every one does, but since Wilkes's
					affair they fall off their metal, &amp; seem to shrink under the brazen hand of Norton &amp; his
					Collegues. I hear there will be no parliament till after Christmas. if the French should be so unwise
					as to suffer the Spanish Court to go on in their present measures (for they refuse to pay the ransom of Manilla, &amp; have driven away our Logwood-cutters already) down go their friends
					the Ministry, &amp; all the schemes of Right Divine &amp; Prerogative; and this is perhaps the best chance we have. are you not struck
					with the great similarity there is between the first years of Charles the first, &amp; the present times? who would have thought it
					possible five years ago?</p>
				     <p>That old Rogue Ld Bath is dead at last. I understood the contest for his spoils lay between your
					noble Friend at Raby &amp; Mr Coleman, the Comick Poet, but whether
					they are fallen to either of them I have not heard as yet. pray what is the policy of that castle? the elder Brother lives more than
					usual in the country, as if he were not in the best humour with his Friends at Court, &amp; the younger has been at times an Orator in the opposition? have they been disobliged, or do they fear to disoblige their former friends, who
					may come into play again? </p>
				     <p>Two more volumes of Buffon are come over: I mention them in case you chuse to have them. I know of
					nothing else, except half a dozen new works of that inexhaustible, eternal, entertaining Scribler Voltaire, who at last (I fear) will go to heaven, for to him entirely it is owing, that the King of France &amp; his
					Council have review'd &amp; set aside the decision of the Parliament of Thoulouse in the affair of Calas. the poor Man, 'tis true, has been broke on the wheel long ago: but his Widow &amp; wretched family may have
					some reparation &amp; his Murtherers may smart a little for it. you see a Scribler may be of some use in the world!</p>
				     <p>If you see Stonhewer at his return from Buxton, be so good to tell him, that there will be only 200 copies of Ld Herbert's
						Life printed, half of which are for Ld Powis, &amp; the rest will
					be given away only. if I happen to have two (wch I do not expect) he shall have one of them.</p>
				     <p>Ah! poor James Lyon! —how do the – Family bear it?
					my best respects to the Lady of Old-Park (the Dutchess I should say) &amp; Lady Mary, &amp;c: I hope
					they are all well. are Mr and Mrs Jonathan with you? do you say your prayers o' nights?</p>

				     <postscript>
					       <p>Mr. Brown, who is quite well, presents his humble Service. he would wish to come tomorrow, only he thinks it impossible; &amp; does
						not believe any body did ever really go so far. </p>
