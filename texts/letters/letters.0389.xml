            <salute>Dear Mr Gray.</salute>
         </opener>
         <p> The Old Man was really dying when I wrote to you from Stilton. But in spite of all his old
					Complaints in spite of an added feaver and fistula, He still holds out, has had strength to undergo two Operations, and is in hopes of
					a perfect recovery. However, if he ever does die I am now secure of succeeding him, &amp; I find the Object of much more importance
					than I at first thought, for one Year with another by fines &amp;c the Preferment is good Â£230 per Annum:</p>
         <p>The Coronation &amp;c prevents Lady Holdernesse from coming into the North. But I am to meet His Lordship at Doncaster the Day after
					to morrow &amp; proceed with him to Aske &amp; Hornby. He will stay
					in the Country only 8 Weeks, &amp; I shall follow him to Town three Weeks after, as My waiting falls
					in the Coronation month. I wish you would write me an Epithalamic Sermon, It could not fail but get me a Mitre next in goodness to
						Squires.
				</p>
         <p>This letter is merely to tell you My Motions and to beg youll write to me, under His Lordships cover to Aske near Richmond. I was at
					Chatsworth last week, and had the pleasure to find Lord John perfectly recoverd. My Love to Mr
					Brown</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>Beleive me Dear Mr Gray <lb/> most cordially yours </salute>
