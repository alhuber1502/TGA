         <p>If Etoughe had any such Paper trusted to his Hands, I don't at all doubt, but it has been shew'd to
					some one here. it is about three Weeks ago, that he was here with his Budget of Libels (for it is his constant Practise twice in a year
					to import a Cargo of Lyes, &amp; scandalous Truths mix'd) but his Confidents are caution'd against me, who have had more Squabbles than
					one either with him, or about him, so that <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> it would be impossible for me to come at it, or even to hear
					of any of the Contents: but I have a round-about Way, or two in my head: if I succeed, you shall be sure to know immediately; but this
					will take up a Week, or a Fortnight, for I must not seem too eager about it. I am amazed at the Impudence of the Fiend, (as much a
					Fiend as I knew him.) you say you took him to task; I am impatient
					to know in what Manner. for I imagine you sent to him, &amp; that this has given him an Opportunity of writing those impudent Letters
					you mention to you. there are three Methods of taking him properly to task, the Cudgel, the Blanket, &amp; the Horse-pond. if you are
					present at the Operation, you may venture to break a Leg or an Arm <hi rend="italic">en attendant,</hi> &amp; when I see you, I may
					possibly give you some Reasons, why you ought to have broke t'other Leg &amp; t'other Arm also: for it is too long to stay, till he is
					a Bishop.</p>
         <p>I do not wonder at their Rage venting itself on Mr Chute. they think him easier to come at, &amp;
					more open to Injury: I am glad he hears so little of the Matter. what my insipid Ld H:[...]on could
					poke out of his Memory against him, I don't conceive. would to God anything I could do, might make all the World think of him as I do.
					but the way you propose, would signify very little.</p>
