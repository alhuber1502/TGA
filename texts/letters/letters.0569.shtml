         <p>Oct: 3. The hills here are cloth'd all up their steep sides with oak, ash, birch,
            holly, &amp;c: some of it has been cut 40 years ago, some within these 8 years, yet all
            is sprung again green, flourishing, &amp; tall for its age, in a place where no soil appears
            but the staring rock, &amp; where a man could scarce stand upright. </p>
         <p>Met a civil young Farmer overseeing his reapers (for it is oat-harvest here) who conducted
            us to a neat white house in the village of Grange, wch is built on a rising ground
            in the midst of a valley. round it the mountains form an aweful amphitheatre, &amp; thro'
            it obliquely runs the Darwent clear as glass, &amp; shewing under it's bridge every trout,
            that passes. beside the village rises a round eminence of rock cover'd entirely with
            old trees, &amp; over that more proudly towers <span style="font-style:italic">Castle-crag,</span> invested also with wood on its sides, &amp; bearing on its naked top some traces of a
            fort said to be Roman. by the side of this hill, wch almost blocks up the way, the
            valley turns to the left &amp; contracts its dimensions, till there is hardly any road
            but the rocky bed of the river. the wood of the mountains increases &amp; their summits
            grow loftier to the eye, &amp; of more fantastic forms: among them appear <span style="font-style:italic">Eagle's-cliff, Dove's-nest, Whitedale-pike,</span> &amp;c: celebrated names in the annals of Keswick. the dale opens about four miles higher
            till you come to <span style="font-style:italic">Sea-Whaite</span> (where lies the way mounting the hills to the right, that leads to the <span style="font-style:italic">Wadd-mines</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> ) all farther access is here barr'd to prying Mortals, only there is a little path
            winding over the Fells, &amp; for some weeks in the year passable to the Dale's-men; but
            the Mountains know well, that these innocent people will not reveal the mysteries
            of their ancient kingdom, the reign of Chaos &amp; old Night.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> only I learn'd, that this dreadful road dividing again leads one branch to <span style="font-style:italic">Ravenglas,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the other to <span style="font-style:italic">Hawkshead.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
         <p>For me I went no farther than the Farmer's (better than 4 m: from Keswick) at <span style="font-style:italic">Grange</span>: his Mother &amp; he brought us butter, that Siserah would have jump'd at, tho' not in
            a lordly dish, bowls of milk, thin oaten-cakes, &amp; ale; &amp; we had carried a cold tongue
            thither with us. our Farmer was himself the Man, that last year plunder'd the Eagle's
            eirie: all the dale are up in arms on such an occasion, for they lose abundance of
            lambs yearly, not to mention hares, partridge, grous, &amp;c: he was let down from the
            cliff in ropes to the shelf of rock, on wch the nest was built, the people above shouting
            &amp; hollowing to fright the old birds, wch flew screaming round, but did not dare to
            attack him. he brought off the eaglet (for there is rarely more than one) &amp; an addle
            egg. the nest was roundish &amp; more than a yard over, made of twigs twisted together.
            seldom a year passes but they take the brood or eggs, &amp; sometimes they shoot one,
            sometimes the other Parent, but the surviver has always found a mate (probably in
            Ireland) &amp; they breed near the old place. by his description I learn, that this species
            is the <span style="font-style:italic">Erne</span> (the Vultur <span style="font-style:italic">Albicilla</span> of LinnÃ¦us in his last edition,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but in yours <span style="font-style:italic">Falco Albicilla</span>) so consult him &amp; Pennant<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> about it.</p>
         <p>Walk'd leisurely home the way we came, but saw a new landscape: the features indeed
            were the same in part, but many new ones were disclosed by the mid-day Sun, &amp; the
            tints were entirely changed. take notice this was the best or perhaps the only day
            for going up Skiddaw, but I thought it better employ'd: it was perfectly serene, &amp;
            hot as midsummer. </p>
         <p>In the evening walk'd alone down to the Lake by the side of <span style="font-style:italic">Crow-Park</span> after sunset &amp; saw the solemn colouring of night draw on, the last gleam of sunshine
            fading away on the hill-tops, the deep serene of the waters, &amp; the long shadows of
            the mountains thrown across them, till they nearly touch'd the hithermost shore. at
            distance heard the murmur of many waterfalls not audible in the day-time.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wish'd for the Moon, but she was <span style="font-style:italic">dark to me &amp; silent, hid in her vacant interlunar cave.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
         <p>Oct: 4. Wd E:, clouds &amp; sunshine, &amp; in the course of the day a few drops of rain.
            Walk'd to <span style="font-style:italic">Crow-park,</span> now a rough pasture, once a glade of ancient oaks, whose large roots still remain
            on the ground, but nothing has sprung from them. if one single tree had remain'd,
            this would have been an unparallel'd spot, &amp; Smith<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> judged right, when he took his print of the Lake from hence, for it is a gentle eminence,
            not too high, on the very margin of the water &amp; commanding it from end to end, looking
            full into the <span style="font-style:italic">gorge of Borodale.</span> I prefer it even to <span style="font-style:italic">Cockshut-hill,</span> wch lies beside it, &amp; to wch I walk'd in the afternoon: it is cover'd with young
            trees both sown &amp; planted, oak, spruce, scotch-fir, &amp;c: all wch thrive wonderfully.
            there is an easy ascent to the top, &amp; the view far preferable to that on Castle-hill
            (wch you remember) because this is lower &amp; nearer to the Lake: for I find all points,
            that are much elevated, spoil the beauty of the valley, &amp; make its parts (wch are
            not large) look poor &amp; diminutive.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> while I was here, a little shower fell, red clouds came marching up the hills from
            the east,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; part of a bright rainbow seem'd to rise along the side of Castle-hill.</p>
         <p>From hence I got to the <span style="font-style:italic">Parsonage</span> a little before Sunset, &amp; saw in my glass a picture, that if I could transmitt to
            you, &amp; fix it in all the softness of its living colours, would fairly sell for a thousand
            pounds. this is the sweetest scene I can yet discover in point of pastoral beauty.
            the rest are in a sublimer style.<br /> </p>
         <p>(to be continued <span style="font-style:italic">without end.</span>)</p>

         <p>P:S: I beg your pardon, but I have no franks. the quill arrived very safe, &amp; doubtless
            is a very snug and commodious method of travelling, for one of the rarities was alive
            &amp; hearty, &amp; was three times plunged in spirits, before I could get it to die. you
            are much improved in observation, for a common eye would certainly take it for a pismire.
            the place of its birth, form of ye antennae, &amp; abdomen, particularly the long <span style="font-style:italic">aculeus</span> under it, shew it to be a <span style="font-style:italic">Cynips</span> (look among the <span style="font-style:italic">Hymenoptera</span>) not yet compleat, for the 4 wings do not yet appear, that I see. it is not a species
            described by LinnÃ¦us, tho' he mentions others, that breed on the leaves, footstalks,
            buds, flowers &amp; bark of the Oak. remember me to Mrs Wharton &amp; the family. my love
