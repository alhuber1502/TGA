   <div class="tei_body"><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup><p>How do you do, good Mr. Brown? Do your inclinations begin to draw northward, as mine
         do, and may I take you a place soon? I wait but for an answer from Mason how to regulate
         our journey, which I should hope may take place in a little more than a week. I shall
         write a line again to settle the exact day, but you may now tell me whether you will
         come to town, or be taken up at Buckden,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or thirdly, whether you will go in a chaise with me by short journeys, and see places
         in our way. I dined yesterday on Richmond Hill, after seeing Chiswick,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and Strawberry, and Sion;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and be assured the face of the country looks an emerald, if you love jewels.</p>
      <p>The Westminster Theatre<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is like to come to a sudden end. The manager<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> will soon embark for Italy without Callista.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> The reason is a speech, which his success in Lothario emboldened him to make the
         other day in a greater theatre.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> It was on the subject of America,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and added so much strength to the opposition, that they came within six of the majority.
         He did not vote, however, though his two brothers did, and, like good boys, with the
         ministry. For this he has been rattled on both sides of his ears, and forbid to appear
         there any more.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> The Houses wait with impatience the conclusion of the East India business<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to rise. The E. of Chatham is mending slowly in his health, but sees nobody on business
         yet, nor has he since he came from Marlborough: yet he goes out daily for an airing.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I have seen his lordship of Cloyne<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> often. He is very jolly, and we devoured four raspberry-puffs together in Cranbournalley<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> standing at a pastrycook's shop in the street; but he is gone, and Heaven knows when
         we shall eat any more.</p>
      <p>Rousseau you see is gone too. I read his letter to my Lord Chancellor from Spalding,
         and hear he has written another long one to Mr. Conway from Dover, begging he might
         no longer be detained here.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> He retains his pension.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> The whole seems madness increasing upon him. There is a most bitter satire on him
         and his Madlle. le Vasseur,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> written by Voltaire, and called <span style="font-style:italic">Guerre de Geneve.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
