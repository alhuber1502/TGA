      <p>How do you do, good Mr. Brown? Do your inclinations begin to draw northward, as mine
         do, and may I take you a place soon? I wait but for an answer from Mason how to regulate
         our journey, which I should hope may take place in a little more than a week. I shall
         write a line again to settle the exact day, but you may now tell me whether you will
         come to town, or be taken up at Buckden, or thirdly, whether you will go in a chaise
         with me by short journeys, and see places in our way. I dined yesterday on Richmond
         Hill, after seeing Chiswick, and Strawberry, and Sion; and be assured the face of
         the country looks an emerald, if you love jewels.

      <p>The Westminster Theatre is like to come to a sudden end. The manager will soon embark
         for Italy without Callista. The reason is a speech, which his success in Lothario
         emboldened him to make the other day in a greater theatre. It was on the subject of
         America, and added so much strength to the opposition, that they came within six of
         the majority. He did not vote, however, though his two brothers did, and, like good
         boys, with the ministry. For this he has been rattled on both sides of his ears, and
         forbid to appear there any more. The Houses wait with impatience the conclusion of
         the East India business to rise. The E. of Chatham is mending slowly in his health,
         but sees nobody on business yet, nor has he since he came from Marlborough: yet he
         goes out daily for an airing.

      <p>I have seen his lordship of Cloyne often. He is very jolly, and we devoured four raspberry-puffs
         together in Cranbournalley standing at a pastrycook's shop in the street; but he is
         gone, and Heaven knows when we shall eat any more.

      <p>Rousseau you see is gone too. I read his letter to my Lord Chancellor from Spalding,
         and hear he has written another long one to Mr. Conway from Dover, begging he might
         no longer be detained here. He retains his pension. The whole seems madness increasing
         upon him. There is a most bitter satire on him and his Madlle. le Vasseur, written
         by Voltaire, and called <span style="font-style:italic">Guerre de Geneve.</span>
