            <p>ODE, IN THE GREEK MANNER</p>
            <p>Strophe 1. </p>
            <p>Awake, Æolian lyre, awake, <lb/> And give to transport all thy trembling strings! <lb/> From Helicon's harmonious springs <lb/> A
						thousand rills their mazy progress take:<lb/> The laughing Flowers, that round them blow, <lb/> Drink life &amp; fragrance, as they
						flow. <lb/> Now the rich stream of musick winds along <lb/> Deep, majestic, smooth, and strong, <lb/> Thro' verdant vales, &amp;
						Ceres' golden reign: <lb/> Now rolling down the steep amain <lb/> With torrent-rapture see it pour; <lb/> The Rocks &amp; nodding
						Groves rebellow to the roar. </p>
            <p>(Antistrophe 1.) </p>
            <p>Oh Sovereign of the willing Soul, <lb/> Parent of sweet &amp; solemn-breathing airs, <lb/> Enchanting Shell! the sullen Cares;
						<lb/> And frantic Passions hear thy soft controul. <lb/> On Thracia's hills the Lord of war <lb/> Has curb'd the fury of his car,
						<lb/> And drop'd his thirsty lance at thy command. <lb/> Perching on the sceptred hand <lb/> Of Jove thy magick lulls the feather'd
						King <lb/> With ruffled plumes, &amp; flagging wing; <lb/> Quench'd in black clouds of slumber lie <lb/> The terrour of his beak,
						&amp; light'nings of his eye. </p>
            <p>Epode 1. </p>
            <p>Thee the Voice, the Dance, obey <lb/> Temper'd to thy warbled lay. <lb/> O'er Idalia's velvet-green <lb/> The rosy-crowned Loves
						are seen <lb/> On Cytherea's day <lb/> With antick Sports, &amp; blew-eyed Pleasures, <lb/> Frisking light in frolick measures:
						<lb/> Now pursuing, now retreating, <lb/> Now in circling troops they meet; <lb/> To brisk notes the cadence beating <lb/> Glance
						their many-twinkling feet. <lb/> Slow melting strains the Queen's approach declare;<lb/> Wher'e'er she turns, the Graces homage pay,
						<lb/> With arms sublime, that float upon the air, <lb/> In gliding state she wins her easy way. <lb/> O'er her warm cheek &amp;
						rising bosom move <lb/> The bloom of young Desire, &amp; purple light of Love. </p>
            <p>(Strophe 2da.) </p>
            <p>Man's feeble race what Ills await, <lb/> Labour &amp; Penury, the racks of Pain, <lb/> Disease, and Sorrow's weeping Train, <lb/>
						And Death, sad refuge from the storms of Fate? <lb/> The fond complaint, my Song, disprove, <lb/> And justify the laws of Jove.
						<lb/> Say, has he given in vain the heavenly Muse? <lb/> Night, &amp; all her sickly Dews, <lb/> Her Spectres wan, and Birds of
						boding cry, <lb/> He gives to range the dreary sky: <lb/> Till fierce Hyperion from afar <lb/> Pours on their scatter'd rear his
						glitt'ring shafts of war. </p>
            <p>(Antistrophe 2da.) </p>
            <p>In climes beyond the solar road, <lb/> Where shaggy Forms o'er ice-built mountains roam, <lb/> The Muse has broke the
						twilight-gloom <lb/> To chear the shivering Native's dull abode; <lb/> And oft beneath the od'rous shade <lb/> Of Chili's boundless
						forests laid <lb/> She deigns to hear the savage Youth repeat <lb/> In loose numbers wildly sweet <lb/> Their feather-cinctured
						Chiefs &amp; dusky Loves. <lb/> Her track wher'e'r the Goddess roves, <lb/> Glory pursue, and generous Shame, <lb/> Th'
						unconquerable Mind, &amp; Freedom's holy flame. </p>
            <p>(Epode 2da.) </p>
            <p>Woods, that wave o'er Delphi's steep, <lb/> Isles, that crown th' Egæan deep, <lb/> Fields, that cool Ilissus laves, <lb/> Or
						where Mæander's amber-waves <lb/> In ling'ring labyrinths creep, <lb/> How do your tuneful Ecchoes languish <lb/> Mute, but to the
						voice of Anguish? <lb/> Where each old poetic Mountain <lb/> Inspiration breath'd around; <lb/> Every Shade &amp; hallow'd Fountain
						<lb/> Murmur'd deep a solemn sound: <lb/> Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour <lb/> Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains.
						<lb/> (Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant Power, <lb/> And coward Vice, that revels in her chains.) <lb/> When Latium had her
						lofty spirit lost, <lb/> They sought, oh Albion, next thy sea-encircled coast. </p>
            <p>(Strophe 3a.) </p>
            <p>Far from the Sun and summer-gale <lb/> In thy green lap was Nature's Darling laid, <lb/> What time, where lucid Avon stray'd,
						<lb/> To him the mighty Mother did unveil <lb/> Her aweful face: the dauntless Child <lb/> Stretch'd forth his little arms, &amp;
						smiled. <lb/> 'This pencil take, (she said) whose colours clear <lb/> 'Richly paint the vernal Year. <lb/> 'Thine too these golden
						keys, immortal Boy, <lb/> 'This can unlock the gates of Joy: <lb/> 'Of Terror that, &amp; thrilling Fears; <lb/> 'Or ope the sacred
						Source of sympathetic tears. </p>
            <p>(Antistrophe 3a.) </p>
            <p>Nor second He, that rode sublime <lb/> Upon the seraph-wings of Extasy <lb/> The secrets of th' Abyss to spy. <lb/> He pass'd the
						flaming bounds of Place &amp; Time. <lb/> The living Throne, the sapphire-Blaze, <lb/> Where Angels tremble while they gaze, <lb/>
						He saw: but blasted with excess of light, <lb/> Closed his eyes in endless night. <lb/> Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous car
						<lb/> Wide o'er the fields of Glory bear <lb/> Two Coursers of ethereal race <lb/> With necks in thunder cloth'd, &amp;
						long-resounding pace. </p>
            <p>(Epode 3a.) </p>
            <p>Hark! his hands the Lyre explore. <lb/> Full-plume'd Fancy, hov'ring o'er <lb/> Scatters from her pictured Urn <lb/> Thoughts,
						that breath, &amp; Words, that burn: <lb/> But ah! 'tis heard no more— <lb/> Oh Lyre divine, what daring Spirit <lb/> Wakes
						thee now? tho' he inherit <lb/> Nor the pride, nor ample pinion, <lb/> That the Theban Eagle bear <lb/> Sailing with supreme
						dominion <lb/> Thro' the azure deep of air: <lb/> Yet oft before his infant-eyes would run <lb/> Such Forms, as glitter in the
						Muse's ray <lb/> With orient hues, unborrow'd of the Sun. <lb/> Yet shall he mount, &amp; keep his distant way <lb/> Beyond the
						limits of a vulgar fate, <lb/> Beneath the Good how far! – but far above the Great. </p>
         </q>
         <p>If this be as tedious to You, as it is grown to me, I shall be sorry that I sent it you. I do not pretend to <hi rend="italic">debellate</hi>
					 any one's Pride: I love my own too well to attempt it. as to mortifying their Vanity it is too easy
					&amp; too mean a task for me to delight in. you are very good in shewing so much sensibility on my account. but be assured, my Taste
					for Praise is not like that of Children for fruit. if there were nothing but Medlars &amp; Blackberries in the world, I could be very
					well content to go without any at all. I dare say that M—n (tho' some years younger than I,) was as little elevated with the
					approbation of Ld D: and Ld M: , as I am mortified by their silence. I desire you would by no means
					suffer this to be copied; nor even shew it, unless to very few, &amp; especially not to mere Scholars
					, that can scan all the measures in Pindar, &amp; say the Scholia by heart. the oftener, &amp; (in spite of poor Trollope ) the <hi rend="italic">more</hi> you write to me, the happier I shall be. I envy your Opera. your
					Politicks I don't understand; but I think, matters can never continue long in the situation they now are. Barbarossa I have read, but I did not cry: at a modern Tragedy it is sufficient not to laugh. I had rather the King's
						Arms look'd askew upon me, than the Mitre; it is enough to be well-bred to both of them. You do not
					mention Ld Strathmore, so that I doubt, if you received my little Letter about him. Masn is still
					here: we are all mighty glad he is in Orders, &amp; no better than any of us. pray inform me, if Dr.
						Clerke is come to Town, &amp; where he is fix'd, that I may write to him, angry as he is. my
					Compliments to my Friend Mrs. Wharton, to your Mother, &amp; all the little Gentry.</p>
