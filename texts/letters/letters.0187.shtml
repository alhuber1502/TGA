         <div class="salute">DEAR SIR –</div>
      </div>
      <p>Very bad! I am YOURS – equally bad!<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is impossible to conciliate these passages to nature and Aristotle.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">'Allowed to modern caprice.'</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> – It is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> caprice, but good sense that made these alterations in the modern Drama. A greater
         liberty in the choice of the fable, and the conduct of it, was the necessary consequence
         of retrenching the Chorus.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Love, and tenderness delight in privacy. The soft effusions of the soul, Mr. Mason,
         will not bear the presence of a gaping, singing, dancing, moralizing, uninteresting
         crowd. And not love alone, but every passion is checked and cooled by this fiddling
         crew. How could Macbeth and his wife have laid the design for Duncan's murder? What
         could they have said to each other in the Hall at midnight, not only if a chorus,
         but if a single mouse had been stirring there? Could Hamlet have met the Ghost, or
         taken his mother to task in <span style="font-style:italic">their</span> company? If Othello had said a harsh word to his wife before <span style="font-style:italic">them,</span> would they not have danced to the window, and called the watch?</p>
      <p>The ancients were perpetually confined and hampered by the necessity of using the
         Chorus, and, if they have done wonders notwithstanding this clog, sure I am they would
         have performed still greater wonders without it. For the same reason we may be allowed
         to admit of more intrigue in our drama, to bring about a great action; it is often
         an essential requisite: and it is not fair to argue against this liberty, from that
         misuse of it, which is common to us, and was formerly so with the French, namely,
         the giving into a silly intricacy of plot, in imitation of the Spanish Dramas. We
         have also since Charles the Second's time, imitated the French (though but awkwardly)
         in framing scenes of mere insipid gallantry. But these were the faults of the writers,
         and not of the art, which enables us with the help of a little contrivance, to have
         as much love as we please, without playing the petits maîtres, or building labyrinths.
         </p>
      <p>I forgot to mention that Comedy contrived<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to be an odd sort of Farce, very like those of the Italian theatre, till the Chorus
         was dismissed. When Nature and Menander brought it into that beautiful form which
         we find in Terence. Tragedy was not so happy till modern times.</p>
      <p>II </p>
      <p>I do not admit that the excellencies of the French writers are measured by the verisimilitude,
         or the regularities of their Dramas <span style="font-style:italic">only.</span> Nothing in them, or in our own, even Shakespeare himself, ever touches us, unless
         rendered <span style="font-style:italic">verisimile,</span> which by good management may be accomplished even in such absurd stories as the Tempest,
         the Witches in Macbeth, or the Fairies in the Midsummer Night's Dream: and I know
         not of any writer that has pleased chiefly in proportion to his <span style="font-style:italic">regularity.</span> Other beauties may indeed be heightened and set off by its means, but of itself it
         hardly pleases at all. Venice Preserved,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or Jane Shore,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> are not so regular as the Orphan,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or Tamerlane,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or Lady Jane Grey.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>III </p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Modern Melpomene.</span> – Here are we got into our tantarums! It is certain that pure poetry may be introduced
         without any Chorus. I refer you to a thousand passages of <span style="font-style:italic">mere</span> description in the Iambic parts of Greek tragedies, and to ten thousand in Shakespeare,
         who is moreover particularly admirable in his introduction of pure poetry, so as to
         join it with pure passion, and yet keep close to nature. This he could accomplish
         with passions the most violent, and transporting, and this any good writer may do
         with passions less impetuous, for it is nonsense to imagine that Tragedy must <span style="font-style:italic">throughout</span> be agitated with the furious passions, or attached by the tender ones. The greater
         part of it must often be spent in a preparation of these passions, in a gradual working
         them up to their height, and must thus pass through a great many cooler scenes and
         a variety of <span style="font-style:italic">nuances,</span> each of which will admit of a proper degree of poetry, and some the purest poetry.
         Nay, the boldest metaphors, and even description in its strongest colouring, are the
         natural expression of some passions, even in their greatest agitation. As to moral
         reflections, there is sufficient room for them in those cooler scenes that I have
         mentioned, and they make the greatest ornaments of such parts, that is to say, if
         they are well joined with the character. If not, they had better be left to the audience,
         than put into the mouths of a set of professed moralists, who keep a shop of sentences,
         and reflections, (I mean the chorus) whether they be sages, as you call them, or young
         girls that learnt them by heart, out of their samples and primers.</p>
      <p>There is nothing ungracious or improper in Jane Shore's reflections on the fate of
         women,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but just the contrary, only that they are in rhyme, and in like manner it is far
         from a beautiful variety when the Chorus makes a transition in the —<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> from plain Iambics to high flown lyric thoughts, expressions and numbers, and when
         their vagaries are over, relapse again into common sense and conversation. A confidante
         in skilful hands, might be a character, and have both sense and dignity. That in Maffei's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Merope has as much as any Chorus.</p>
      <p>The Greeks might sing better than the French, but I'll be burnt if they <span style="font-style:italic">danced</span> with more grace, expression, or even pathos, yet who ever thought of shedding tears
         at a French Opera?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>IV </p>
      <p>If modern music cannot, as you say, express poetry, it is not a perfection, but a
         deterioration; you might as well say that the <span style="font-style:italic">perfectionment</span> of poetry would be the rendering it incapable of expressing the passions.</p>
