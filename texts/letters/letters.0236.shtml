         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor</div>
      </div>
      <p>Instead of going to Twickenham I was obliged to send my excuses,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the same day Mr. W: sent a messenger to say he was confined in Town with a Fever
         &amp; a Rash.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he has since wrote me word, that he is well again; but for me I continue much as
         I was, &amp; have been but once out of the house to walk, since I return'd from Hampshire.
         being much inclined to bleeding myself, I yet was fearful to venture, least it should
         bring on a regular fit of the Gout, so I sent for advice at last, &amp; expected Dr Hayes<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> should tell me presently, whether it were Gout or Rheumatism. in his talk he treated
         it rather as the former, but his prescription appears to me to be meant for the latter.
         you will judge. he took away 10 or 11 <span style="font-style:italic">Oz</span> of blood, &amp; order'd these draughts night &amp; morning:–<span style="font-style:italic">Sal: Absinth. Succ: Limon. finitâ effervescentiâ add: Aqu: Alexit. Simpl:, Menth:
            Piperit, Magnes. alb., Tinct: G. Guiac. Spirituos.</span> the quantities I can't read; only I think there is a Dram of the Tincture, &amp; ½ a
         Dram of Magnesia in each draught. the Blood had no sign of inflammation, but of a
         bright red: the Serum of a dark yellow with little transparency, not viscid to the
         touch. the draughts (wch I took over night only) made me sweat almost immediately,
         &amp; open'd a little in the morning. the consequence is, that I have still many slight
         complaints. broken &amp; unrefreshing sleeps, as before. less feverish than I was, in
         a morning: instead of it a sensation of weariness and soreness in both feet, wch goes
         off in the day. a frequent dizziness &amp; lightness of head. easily fatigued with motion.
         sometimes a little pain in my breast, as I had in the winter. these symptoms are all
         too slight to make an illness; but they do not make perfect health. that is sure.
      </p>
      <p>Tho' I allow abundance for your kindness &amp; partiality to me, I am yet much pleased
         with the good opinion you seem to have of the <span style="font-style:italic">Bard.</span> you may alter that <span style="font-style:italic">Robed in the Sable,</span> &amp;c,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> almost in your own words, thus
