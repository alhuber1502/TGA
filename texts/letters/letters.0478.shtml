         <div class="salute">Dear Doctor </div>
      </div>
      <p>Whatever my pen may do, I am sure my thoughts expatiate no where oftener or with more
         pleasure than to Old-Park. I hope you have made my peace with Miss Debo:.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is certain, whether her name were in my letter<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or not, she was as present to my memory, as the rest of the little family, &amp; I desire
         you would present her with two kisses in my name, &amp; one apiece to all the others:
         for I shall take the liberty to kiss them all (great &amp; small) as you are to be my
         proxy.</p>
      <p>In spite of the rain, wch I think continued with very short intervals till the beginning
         of this month, &amp; quite effaced the summer from the year, I made a shift to pass May
         &amp; June not disagreeably in Kent. I was surprised at the beauty of the road to Canterbury,
         wch (I know not why) had not struck me in the same manner before. the whole county
         is a rich &amp; well-cultivated garden, orchards, cherry-grounds, hop-gardens, intermix'd
         with corn &amp; frequent villages, gentle risings cover'd with wood, and every where the
         Thames &amp; Medway breaking in upon the Landscape with all their navigation. it was indeed
         owing to the bad weather, that the whole scene was dress'd in that tender emerald-green,
         wch one usually sees only for a fortnight in the opening of spring, &amp; this continued
         till I left the country. my residence was eight miles east of Canterbury in a little
         quiet valley on the skirts of Barham-down.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in these parts the whole soil is chalk, and whenever it holds up, in half an hour
         it is dry enough to walk out. I took the opportunity of three or four days fine weather
         to go into the Isle of Thanet, saw Margate (wch is Bartholomew-Fair by the seaside)
         Ramsgate, &amp; other places there, &amp; so came by Sandwich, Deal, Dover, Folkstone, &amp; Hithe
         back again. the coast is not like Hartlepool: there are no rocks, but only chalky
         cliffs of no great height, till you come to Dover. there indeed they are noble &amp; picturesque,
         &amp; the opposite coasts of France begin to bound your view, wch was left before to range
         unlimited by any thing but the horizon: yet it is by no means a <span style="font-style:italic">shipless</span> sea, but every where peopled with white sails &amp; vessels of all sizes in motion; and
         take notice (except in the Isle, wch is all corn-fields, &amp; has very little inclosure)
         there are in all places hedge-rows &amp; tall trees even within a few yards of the beach,
         particularly Hithe stands on an eminence cover'd with wood. I shall confess we had
         fires of a night (ay, &amp; a day too) several times even in June: but don't go &amp; take
         advantage of this, for it was the most untoward year that ever I remember.</p>
      <p>Your Friend Rousseau (I doubt) grows tired of Mr Davenport &amp; Derbyshire.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he has pick'd a quarrel with David Hume &amp; writes him letters of 14 pages Folio upbraiding
         him with all his <span style="font-style:italic">noirceurs.</span> take one only as a specimen, he says, that at Calais they chanced to sleep in the
         same room together, &amp; that he overheard David talking in his sleep, &amp; saying, <span style="font-style:italic">Ah! Je le tiens, ce Jean-Jacques l√°.</span> In short (I fear) for want of persecution &amp; admiration (for these are his real complaints)
         he will go back to the continent.</p>
      <p>What shall I say to you about the Ministry?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I am as angry as a Common-council Man of London about my Ld Chatham:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but a little more patient, &amp; will hold my tongue till the end of the year. in the
         mean time I do mutter in secret &amp; to you, that to quit the house of Commons, his natural
         strength; to sap his own popularity &amp; grandeur (which no one but himself could have
         done) by assuming a foolish title; &amp; to hope that he could win by it &amp; attach to him
         a Court, that hate him, &amp; will dismiss him, as soon as ever they dare, was the weakest
         thing, that ever was done by so great a Man. had it not been for this, I should have
         rejoiced at the breach between him &amp; Ld Temple,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; at the union between him &amp; the D: of Grafton &amp; Mr Conway: but patience! we shall
         see! St:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> perhaps is in the country (for he hoped for a month's leave of absence) &amp; if you
         see him, you will learn more than I can tell you.</p>
      <p>Mason is at Aston. he is no longer so anxious about his Wife's health, as he was,
         tho' I find she still has a cough, &amp; moreover<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I find she is not with child: but he made such a bragging, how could one chuse but
         believe him.</p>
      <p>When I was in town, I mark'd in my pocket-book the utmost limits &amp; division of the
         two columns in your Thermometer, &amp; ask'd Mr. Ayscough<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Instrument-Maker on Ludgate Hill, what scales they were. he immediately assured
         me, that one was Fahrenheit's, &amp; shew'd me one exactly so divided. the other he took
         for Reaumur's, but, as he said there were different scales of his contrivance, he
         could not exactly tell, wch of them it was. your Brother<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> told me, you wanted to know, who wrote Duke Wharton's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Life in the Biography:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I think, it is chiefly borrowed from a silly book enough call'd <span style="font-style:italic">Memoirs of that Duke</span>:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but who put it together there, no one can inform me. the only person certainly known
         to write in that vile collection (I mean these latter volumes) is Dr Nicholls,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who was expell'd here for stealing books.</p>
      <p>Have you read the <span style="font-style:italic">New Bath-Guide?</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> it is the only [thing]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in fashion, &amp; is a new &amp; original kind of humour. Miss Prue's Conversion<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I doubt you will paste down, as Sr W: St Quintyn<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> did, before he carried it to his daughter. yet I remember you all read <span style="font-style:italic">Crazy Tales</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> without pasting. Buffon's first collection of Monkies are come out (it makes the
         14th volume)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> something, but not much, to my edification: for he is pretty well acquainted with
         their persons, but not with their manners.</p>
      <p>I shall be glad to hear, how far Mrs Ettrick<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has succeeded, &amp; when you see an end to her troubles. my best respects to Mrs. Wharton,
         &amp; compliments to all your family: I will not name them, least I should affront any
         body.</p>
