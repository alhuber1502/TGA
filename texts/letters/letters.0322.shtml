         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>It is always time to write, (whether Louisbourg be taken, or not) &amp; I am always alike
         glad to hear from you. I am glad however to repay you with the King of Prussia: there
         is a Man for you at a dead lift, that has beat &amp; baffled his three most powerful enemies,
         who had swallow'd him up in Idea! not that I look upon this last exploit, however
         seasonable, as his most heroick exploit; I suppose it was only butchering a great
         flock of slaves &amp; savages, a conquest, that, but for the necessity of it, he would
         have disdain'd. what use our little supply is like to be of in Germany I can not say;
         I only know, that my Ld Granby with his horse had a bridge, wch broke under them,
         &amp; that he (the Marquiss) was sore bruised, &amp; laid up: but I think the Electorate may
         be saved for all this.
      </p>
      <p>Old Pa: wrote to me from Scarborough three weeks ago. he had seen more in his journey
         than ever he saw before in his life, &amp; was to see twice as much more in his way to
         Glamis. he is become acquainted with rocks &amp; precipices, &amp; despises the tameness and
         insipidity of all we call fine in the South. Mr. Pitt, &amp; he, did not propose being
         at Glamis till the end of August: My Ld (I think) set out from Rainton on the 27th.
      </p>
      <p>If I had been at the great gambling dinner, I should have desired, somebody would
         help me to a collop of the <span style="font-style:italic">other</span> great Turtle, tho' I believe, 'tis vile meat. you tell me nothing about the good
         family at Ripton, that were to come together from all quarters &amp; be so happy this
         summer: has any ill chance hinder'd their meeting, or have you not paid them a visit
         this vacation? it is an infinite while, since I heard from M:n, I know no more of
         him than you do, but I hope Caractacus will profit of our losses. if pleasure or application
         take up his thoughts I am half content.
      </p>
      <p>My health I can not complain of, but as to my spirits they are always many degrees
         below changeable, &amp; I seem to myself to inspire every thing around me with ennuy &amp;
         dejection; but some time or other all these things must come to a conclusion, till
         which day I shall remain very sincerely 
      </p>
