         <div class="salute">Dear Mason</div>
      </div>
      <p>I sympathize with your eyes, having been confined at Florence with the same complaint
         for three weeks, but (I hope) in a much worse degree, for besides not seeing, I could
         not sleep in the night for pain. have a care of old Women (who are all great Oculists)
         &amp; do not let them trifle with so tender a part. 
      </p>
      <p>I have been exercising my eyes at Peterborough, Crowland, Thorney, Ely, &amp;c: and am
         grown a great Fen-Antiquary; this was the reason I did not answer you directly, as
         your Letter came in my absence. I own, I have been all this while expecting Caractacus,
         or at least three Choruses, &amp; now you do not so much as tell me, it is finish'd. sure
         your spiritual functions, &amp; even your attentions to the Dutchess of Norfolk &amp; Sir
         Coniers, might have allow'd you some little intervals for Poetry. if not, (now Queen
         Hecuba is gone) I utterly despair: for (say what you will) it was not retirement,
         it was not leisure, or the summer, or the country, that used to make you so voluminous:
         it was emulation, it was rivalry, it was the collision of tragedy against tragedy,
         that kindled your fires, &amp; set old Mona in a blaze. you do not say, who succeeds her
         Trojan Majesty; it ought to be well consider'd: let me have none of your prosaic Curates.
         I shall have you write Sermons, &amp; private Forms, &amp; Heavens open to all Men.
      </p>
      <p>That old fizzling Duke is coming here again (but I hope to be gone first) to hear
         speeches in his new Library with the Bp of Bristol to air his close-stool. they have
         fitted it up (not the close-stool, nor the Bp) but the Library with classes, that
         will hold any thing, but books: yet books they must hold, &amp; all the bulky old Commentators,
         the Synopses, &amp; Tractatus Tractatuums, are wash'd with white of eggs, gilt &amp; letter'd,
         and drawn up in review before his Grace. your Uncle Balguy takes his Doctor's degree,
         &amp; preaches ye Commencement-Sermon, at Dr Green's request.
      </p>
      <p>Mr B:n sends his love, &amp; bids me tell you that Dr W:n has sent you his new-Legation
         with its dedication to Ld Mansfield. would you have it sent you? Ld Strathmore goes
         tomorrow into the North to come of age. I keep an Owl in the Garden as like me, as
         it can stare; only I don't eat raw meat, nor bite people by the fingers. this is all
         the news of ye place. Adieu, dear M:n, &amp; write to me directly, if it won't hurt you,
         or I shall think you worse, than you are.
      </p>
