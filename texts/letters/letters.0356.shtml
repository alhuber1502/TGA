         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>I received the little letter,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; the inclosed, wch was a summons from the Insurance-Office. on Tuesday last came
         a dispatch from Lisbon. it is probable you have had one from my Lord,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but least you should not, I will tell you the chief contents of mine. Mr Pitt says,
         they were both dreadfully sick all the time they were beating about the Channel, but
         when they came to Plymouth (I find) my Lord was so well however, that he open'd a
         Ball in the Dock-yard with the Master-Attendant's Daughter. they set sail from thence
         on the 28th,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; cross'd the Bay with a very smooth Sea, came in sight of C. Finisterre in 3 days
         time, &amp; before night saw the rugged Mountains of Galicia with great delight, &amp; came
         near the coast of Portugal opposite to Oporto. but (the wind changing in the night)
         they drove off to the West, and were in a way to visit the Brasils. however on the
         7th of this month they enter'd the Tagus. he describes the Rock of Lisbon, as a most
         romantic &amp; beautiful scene; &amp; all the North-bank of the river up to the City has (he
         says) every charm but verdure. the City itself too in that view is very noble, &amp; shews
         but little of the Earthquake.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that is all as yet.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> my Ld is to write next packet.</p>
      <p>Ld G: S:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> proceeds in his defence. People wonder at, (&amp; some there are that celebrate) his
         dexterity, his easy elocution, &amp; unembarass'd manner. he told Gen: Cholmondeley,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> one of his Judges, who was asking a Witness some Question, that it was such a question
         as no Gentleman, or Man of honour, would put, &amp; it was one of his misfortunes to have
         him among his Judges. upon wch some Persons behind him gave a loud clap. but I do
         not find the Court either committed or reprimanded them. Ld Albemarle<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> only contented himself with saying, he was sure, that those Men could be neither
         Gentlemen, nor Men of honour. in the midst of this I do not hear any one point made
         out in his favour; &amp; Col: Sloper,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> whose evidence bore the hardest upon him, &amp; whom he had reflected upon with great
         warmth, &amp; very opprobrious terms, has offer'd the Court (if they had any doubt of
         his veracity) to produce 16 more Witnesses, who will say the same thing. to be sure
         nothing in the Field of Minden could be half as dreadful, as this daily baiting he
         now is exposed to; so (supposing him a Coward) he has chose very ill.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I am not very sorry, your Venetians<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> have abandon'd you: no more (I believe) are you. Mason is very well, sitting (as
         usual) for his picture,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; while that is doing, will not think of Yorkshire. we heard Delaval<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the other night play upon the water-glasses,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; I was astonish'd. no instrument, that I know, has so celestial a tone. I thought
         it was a Cherubim in a box.</p>
