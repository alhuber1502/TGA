      </div>
      <p>I received the little letter, &amp; the inclosed, wch was a summons from the Insurance-Office.
         on Tuesday last came a dispatch from Lisbon. it is probable you have had one from
         my Lord, but least you should not, I will tell you the chief contents of mine. Mr
         Pitt says, they were both dreadfully sick all the time they were beating about the
         Channel, but when they came to Plymouth (I find) my Lord was so well however, that
         he open'd a Ball in the Dock-yard with the Master-Attendant's Daughter. they set sail
         from thence on the 28th, &amp; cross'd the Bay with a very smooth Sea, came in sight of
         C. Finisterre in 3 days time, &amp; before night saw the rugged Mountains of Galicia with
         great delight, &amp; came near the coast of Portugal opposite to Oporto. but (the wind
         changing in the night) they drove off to the West, and were in a way to visit the
         Brasils. however on the 7th of this month they enter'd the Tagus. he describes the
         Rock of Lisbon, as a most romantic &amp; beautiful scene; &amp; all the North-bank of the
         river up to the City has (he says) every charm but verdure. the City itself too in
         that view is very noble, &amp; shews but little of the Earthquake. that is all as yet.
         my Ld is to write next packet.
      </p>
      <p>Ld G: S: proceeds in his defence. People wonder at, (&amp; some there are that celebrate)
         his dexterity, his easy elocution, &amp; unembarass'd manner. he told Gen: Cholmondeley,
         one of his Judges, who was asking a Witness some Question, that it was such a question
         as no Gentleman, or Man of honour, would put, &amp; it was one of his misfortunes to have
         him among his Judges. upon wch some Persons behind him gave a loud clap. but I do
         not find the Court either committed or reprimanded them. Ld Albemarle only contented
         himself with saying, he was sure, that those Men could be neither Gentlemen, nor Men
         of honour. in the midst of this I do not hear any one point made out in his favour;
         &amp; Col: Sloper, whose evidence bore the hardest upon him, &amp; whom he had reflected upon
         with great warmth, &amp; very opprobrious terms, has offer'd the Court (if they had any
         doubt of his veracity) to produce 16 more Witnesses, who will say the same thing.
         to be sure nothing in the Field of Minden could be half as dreadful, as this daily
         baiting he now is exposed to; so (supposing him a Coward) he has chose very ill.
      </p>
      <p>I am not very sorry, your Venetians have abandon'd you: no more (I believe) are you.
         Mason is very well, sitting (as usual) for his picture, &amp; while that is doing, will
         not think of Yorkshire. we heard Delaval the other night play upon the water-glasses,
         &amp; I was astonish'd. no instrument, that I know, has so celestial a tone. I thought
         it was a Cherubim in a box.
