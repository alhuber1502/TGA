      </div>
      <p>As you &amp; Mr R: Wharton seem determined for the foundation, I shall say no more on
         that subject: it is pity you could not resolve sooner, for I fear you are now too
         late, &amp; must defer your design till the next year, as the Election at Eton begins
         this day se'nnight, &amp; your Nephew ought to be there on the evening of the 27th at
         farthest, wch is scarce possible. you have never told me his age: but (I suppose)
         you know, that after 15 compleat Boys are excluded from the election, &amp; that a Certificate
         of their age, (that is, an extract from the Parish-Register, where they were baptised,)
         is always required, wch must be attested &amp; sign'd by the Minister &amp; Churchwardens
         of the said Parish. your Nephew (I imagine) is much younger than fifteen, &amp; therefore
         there will be no great inconvenience if he should be placed at Eton, whenever it suits
         Mr Wharton to carry him, &amp; there wait for the next election. this is commonly practised,
         &amp; Dr A: (I do not doubt) will be equally ready to serve him then, as now. he will
         probably be placed pretty high in the School, having had the same education, that
         is in use there, &amp; will have time to familiarise himself to the place, before he actually
         enters the College. I have waited to know your intentions, before I could answer Dr
         A:s letter; &amp; wish you would now write to me, what you finally determine. there is
         a Month's Breaking-up immediately after the Election (wch lasts a week) so it is probable
         Mr Wharton will hardly send his Son till those holidays are over.
      </p>
      <p>I do not mention the subject you hint at for the same reason you give me; it should
         be <span style="font-style:italic">offer'd,</span> &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">clear of all taxes,</span> before I would go into it, in spite of the mines in America, on which I congratulate
         you.
      </p>
      <p>I shall hope to see Old-Park next summer, if I am not bedrid, but who can tell? Mr
         Brown presents his best services to the family with mine: he is older than I.
