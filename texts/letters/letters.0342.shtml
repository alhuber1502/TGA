         <div class="salute">Dear Mason </div>
      </div>
      <p>I was alarmed to hear the condition you were in, when you left Cambridge, &amp; tho' Mr
         Brown had a letter to tell him, you were mending apace, while I was there; yet it
         would give me great pleasure to hear more particularly from yourself, how you are.
         I am just settled in my new habitation in Southampton-Row, &amp;, tho' a solitary &amp; dispirited
         creature, not unquiet, nor wholly unpleasant to myself. the Musæum will be my chief
         amusement. I this day passed thro' the jaws of a great Leviathan, that lay in my way,
         into the belly of Dr Templeman, Super-Intendent of ye reading-room, who congratulated
         himself on the sight of so much good company. We were A Man, that writes for Ld Royston;
         A Man, that writes for Dr Burton of York; a third, that writes for the Emperour of
         Germany, or Dr Pocock, for he speaks the worst English I ever heard; Dr. Stukely,
         who writes for himself, the very worst Person he could write for; &amp; I, who only read
         to know, if there were any thing worth writing, &amp; that not without some difficulty.
         I find, that they printed 1000 copies of ye Harleian Catalogue, and have sold fourscore;
         that they have 900£ a year income, &amp; spend 1300, &amp; that they are building apartments
         for the Under-Keepers, so I expect in Winter to see the Collection advertised, &amp; set
         to auction.
      </p>
      <p>Have you read the Clarendon-book? do you remember Mr Cambridge's account of it, before
         it came out; how well he recollected all the faults, &amp; how utterly he forgot all the
         beauties? surely the grossest Taste is better, than such a sort of Delicacy.
      </p>
      <p>The Invasion goes on as quietly, as if we believed every Frenchman, that set his foot
         on English ground, would die on the spot, like a Toad in Ireland: no body, but I &amp;
         Fobus, are in a fright about it. by the way he goes to Church (not for the invasion)
         but eversince his Sister Castle-comer died, who was the last of ye brood.
