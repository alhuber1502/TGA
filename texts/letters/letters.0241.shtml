      <p>It is not oweing to insensibility (as by this time you may possibly imagine) but to
         the misfortune I had of staying longer than usual this winter in Town, that I have
         not sooner return'd you my thanks for the particular honour you did me, when you were
         at Cambridge. You tell me with so much warmth &amp; frankness, that I have given you pleasure,
         that it would be mere hypocrisy in me, if I did not confess to you with the same openness
         of mind, that I am pleased. my wish &amp; the only reward I ask in writing is to give
         some little satisfaction to a few Men of sense &amp; character. I say <span class="hi">a few</span>, because there are but few such: were they more numerous, I would wish (I own) to
         please them all; &amp; yet not fear being censured for too eager a desire of fame. but
         as much as your proceeding may have raised my vanity, I shall by no means promise
         that you will like your new acquaintance, when you see him <span class="hi">out of print</span>. however with all his imperfections on his head he will, be assured, make the experiment
         the very first opportunity, &amp; claim in person the honour you offer him, whenever he
         is so happy to find himself in the same place with you.
      </p>
      <p>I am <span class="hi">much</span> obliged to you for the Iris &amp; Aurora they are more elegant &amp; have more of the relish
         of antiquity than any thing I have met with in modern Italy. permit me to present
         my Compliments to Lady Swinburn. I am not known to her at all, and yet have had the
         honour of passing three days in her company. when &amp; where it was, I leave to her Ladyship's
         recollection.
