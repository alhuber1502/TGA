					       <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>Perhaps You have not yet hang'd yourself! when you do (as doubtless you must be thinking of it) be
					so good as to give me a day or two's notice, that I may be a little prepared. yet who knows? possibly your education at St John's (in
					conjunction with the Bp of Glr:) may suggest to you, that the <hi rend="italic">naked Indian,</hi>
					that found Pitt's diamond, made no bad bargain, when he sold it for three oyster-shells, &amp; a
					Pompon of glass-beads to stick in his Wife's hair! if so, you may live, &amp; read on.</p>
				     <p>Last week I had an application from a broken Tradesman (whose Wife I knew) to desire my interest with the D: of Newcastle for a
					Tide-Waiter's place; &amp; he adds, <hi rend="italic">Sr, your speedy compliance with this, will greatly oblige all our Family.</hi>
					this morning, before I was up, Dr Moreton of the Mus√¶um call'd here &amp; left the inclosed
						note. he is a mighty civil Man, for the rest you know him full as well as I do; &amp; I insist that
					you return me a civil answer. I do not insist, that you should get him the Mastership: on the
					contrary I desire (as any body would in such a case) that you will get it for yourself; as I intend, when I hear it is vacant, to have
					the Tidewaiter's place, if I miss of the Privy-Seal, &amp; Cofferership.</p>
