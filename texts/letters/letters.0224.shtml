      <p>I am clear, that you are in the right way &amp; that you ought to make your excuses at
         the Queen's Arms<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with all possible civility to Foth:ll;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and perhaps the civilest excuse is to tell the truth, to him at least, that it would
         be neither grateful, nor prudent, to hazard disobliging the Gentlemen at the Mitre,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> among whom you have several Friends, &amp; besides it will be always more in your power
         to recommend moderate measures, while you continue connected with one Party, than
         if you should lose yourself with both by seeming to divide yourself between them.
         but how far this is to be said, &amp; to whom, you are best able to determine.</p>
