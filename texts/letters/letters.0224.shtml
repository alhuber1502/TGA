      <p>I am clear, that you are in the right way &amp; that you ought to make your excuses at
         the Queen's Arms with all possible civility to Foth:ll; and perhaps the civilest excuse
         is to tell the truth, to him at least, that it would be neither grateful, nor prudent,
         to hazard disobliging the Gentlemen at the Mitre, among whom you have several Friends,
         &amp; besides it will be always more in your power to recommend moderate measures, while
         you continue connected with one Party, than if you should lose yourself with both
         by seeming to divide yourself between them. but how far this is to be said, &amp; to whom,
         you are best able to determine.
