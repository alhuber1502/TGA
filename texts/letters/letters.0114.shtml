         <div class="salute">My Dear Sr</div>
      </div>
      <p>I complain no more. You have not forgot me. Mrs Dick, to whom I resorted for a Dish
         of Coffee, instead thereof produced unto me from between her fat Breasts your kind
         Letter, big with another no less kind from our poor mangled Friend<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to whom I now address myself (you don't take it ill) &amp; let him know, that as soon
         as I got hither, I took wing for the Strand to see a certain Acquaintance of his<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (for I then knew not whether he were dead, or alive) &amp; get some News of him. I was
         so struck with the great resemblance between them,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that it made me cry out. he is a true Eagle, but a little tamer, &amp; a little fatter
         than the Eagle Resident: I told him so, but he did not seem to think it so great a
         Compliment, as I did. his Wife<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> had miscarried but was quite well again; his house half pulled down, but riseing
         again more magnificent from its Ruins. he received me, as became a Bird of his Race,
         &amp; suffer'd himself to be caressed without giveing me one Peck, or Scratch. the only
         bad thing I know of him, is, that he wears a Frock, &amp; a Bob-Wigg. may I charge you,
         my dear Mr Chute (I give you your great Name for want of a little tiny one) with my
         Compliments to Dr Cocchi,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Benevoli<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (tho' I hate him) &amp; their Patient. particularly to this last for recovering so soon,
         &amp; so much to my Satisfaction. I think one may call him dear Creature, &amp; be fond in
         Security under the Sanction of your Cover. I carried his Mus:m Flor:m<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to Commissioner Haddock,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who is Liddel's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Uncle. that Gentleman had left Paris, haveing been elected for some place in this
         Parliament, &amp; (tho' it is like to be controverted) took that opportunity to return
         to England for a time, but is now gone, I think to Spaw. Adieu! Mr M: [...]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Nunc ad te totum me converto, suavissime ChutÃ®! whom I wrote to from Dover.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if this be London, Lord send me to Constantinople. either I, or it are extremely
         odd. the Boys laugh at the depth of my Ruffles, the immensity of my Bagg, &amp; the length
         of my Sword. I am as an Alien in my native land, yea! I am as an Owl among the small
         birds. it rains, every body is discontented, &amp; so am I. you can't imagine how mortifieing
         it is to fall into the hands of an English Barber. Lord, how You or Polleri would
         storm in such a Case. don't think of comeing hither without Lavaur,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or something equivalent to him (not an elephant).<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Natives are alive, &amp; flourishing. the fashion is a grey frock with round Sleeves,
         Bob-wig, or a Spencer, plain Hat with enormous Brims, &amp; shallow Crown, cock'd as bluff,
         as possible, Muslin-Neckcloth twisted round, rumpled, &amp; tuck'd into the breast; all
         this with a certain Safaring<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Air, as if they were just come back from Cartagena.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if my pockets had any thing in them, I should be afraid of every body I met. look
         in their face, they knock you down; speak to them, they bite off your Nose. I am no
         longer ashamed in publick, but extremely afraid. if ever they catch me among 'em,
         I give them leave to eat me. so much for dress, as to Politicks, every body is extreme
         angry with all that has been, or shall be done: even a Victory at this time would
         be look'd upon as a wicked attempt to please the Nation. the Theatres open not till
         tomorrow, so you will excuse my giveing no account of them tonight. now I have been
         at home, &amp; seen how things go there, would I were with you again, that the Remainder
         of my Dream might at least be agreeable. as it is, my prospect can not well be more
         unpleasing; but why do I trouble your Goodnature with such considerations? be assured,
         that when I am happy (if that can ever be) your Esteem will greatly add to that happiness,
         &amp; when most the contrary, will always alleviate, what I suffer. many, many thanks
         for your kindness; for your travels, for your News, for all the trouble I have given,
         &amp; must give you. omit nothing, when you write, for things that were quite indifferent
         to me at Florence, at this distance become interesting. humble Service to Polleri;
         obliged for his harmonious Salutation, I hope to see some Scratches with his black
         Claw in your next. Adieu!</p>
