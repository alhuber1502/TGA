         <div class="salute">Dear Mason </div>
      </div>
      <p>I rejoice to find you are both in health, &amp; that one or other of you at least can
         have your teeming-time. you are wise as a serpent, but the devil of a dove, in timing
         both your satire, &amp; your compliment. when a Man stands on the very verge of Legislation
         with all his <span style="font-style:italic">unblushing</span> honours thick upon him; when the Gout has nip'd him in the bud, &amp; blasted all his
         hopes at least for one winter: then come you buzzing about his nose, &amp; strike your
         sting deep into the reddest angriest part of his toe, wch will surely mortify. when
         another has been weak enough in the plenitude of power to disarm himself of his popularity;
         &amp; to conciliate a Court, that naturally hates him, submits to be deck'd in their trappings,
         &amp; fondle their lap-dogs: then come you to lull him with your gentlest hum, recalling
         his good deeds, &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">hoping</span>  what I (with all my old partialities) scarce should dare to hope, if I had but any
         one else to put my trust in. let you alone, where <span style="font-style:italic">Spite</span> &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">Interest</span> are in view!â€“ay, ay, Mrs M: (I see) will be a Bishopess.
      </p>
      <p>Well, I transcribed your wickedness in a print-hand &amp; sent it by last Sunday's post
         to Dr G: with your orders about it, for I had heard St: say, that he hoped for a month's
         respite to go into the North, &amp; did not know, but he might be gone. G: was to send
         me word, he had received it, but has not yet done so, and (Lord bless me!) who knows,
         but he may be gone into Derbyshire, &amp; the Ode gone after him! if so, mind, I am innocent,
         &amp; meant for the best. I liked it vastly, &amp; thought it very well-turn'd &amp; easy, especially
         the <span style="font-style:italic">diabolical</span>  part of it: I fear, it will not keep, &amp; would have wish'd the Publick might have
         eat it fresh: but if any untoward accident should delay it, it will be still better
         than most things, that appear at their table.
      </p>
      <p>I shall finish, where you begun, with my apology. you say you have <span style="font-style:italic">neglected</span> me, &amp; (to make it relish the better) <span style="font-style:italic">with many others.</span> for my part I have not neglected you: but I have always consider'd the <span style="font-style:italic">Happy,</span> that is, new-married People, as too sacred, or too profane, a thing to be approach'd
         by me: when the year is over, I have no longer any respect or aversion for them.
      </p>

            sincerely<br /> Yours

         <p>P:S: My best respects to Madam in her grogram gown. I have long since heard, that
            you were out of pain with regard to her health. Mr Brown is gone to see his Brother
            near Margate.
