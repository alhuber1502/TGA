         <div class="dateline">Tunbridge Sept 10th 55. </div> 
         <div class="salute">Dear Mr Gray </div>
      </div>
      <p>I promisd to write to you from Tunbridge And now I perform it. You can't imagine how
         much people lye with one another here. I had the narrowest escape in the world. The
         Countess of Schoonfeld<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> lay with evry body and she was but just gone when I came hither. However since I
         came We have sent Miss Ash<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to Town with Child some people say twas Count Bryll<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> that did it But I say nothing, I had been here two days before she went; thats all.
         Lady Caroline<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who corresponds with her evry post, tells it publickly on the pantiles, then Ladies
         are surprizd. &amp; She crys out "Lord how can ye I wonder she is not with Child evry
         year." Heres a Mons de St Simon<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> here, much laid with also. but The property of one Lady only who as Sr John Falstaffe
         says makes him "her Philosophers two stones".<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> You cant conceive how she pillages him. Sometimes they take their pastime in the
         midst of a Curricle sometimes in a feild sometimes at his Lodgings &amp; where not? Lady
         Rotchfort<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> has been here three Days with Lady H<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> A delightful Character! so full of the Rheumatics and Achs &amp; Pains all over and then
         so Genède you know &amp; so detesting of Public places, because People dont dress so strangely
         as they did four year ago, and are not frightful enough to make one Laugh.–I was told
         yesterday by Lady H that it was her Birthday and she wondered I had not writ her some
         Verses. so I did, &amp; here they are.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>Had R–d<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> bad my muse essay<br /> To hail her, on her natal day <br /> I soon had Ransackd Natures bowers <br /> For Blushing fruit &amp; fragrant flowrs <br /> And sworn till Fops believd it true <br /> That all their sweetness all their hue <br /> Were nought to what her cheekes advance <br /> Adornd tout alamode de France</p> 
         <p>Or had gay Lady C***<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <br /> Been bent on such an odd design, <br /> And deignd my verses to receive, <br /> (For Verse is all I have to give) <br /> It soon had been my tuneful prayr <br /> To beg propitious Fate to spare <br /> The Bliss she has, &amp; alway lend <br /> An easy Lord and genrous friend.</p> 
         <p>But how to suit my song to you <br /> Is mighty hard, for entre nous <br /> You're most unfashionably fair, <br /> Content with your own face &amp; air, <br /> And more unfashionably true, <br /> A Husband bounds your utmost view.</p> 
         <p>This then the Case, my Rhymes I'll close, <br /> And wish in verse as plain as prose, <br /> That Tunbridge from her springs may grant <br /> The little added health you want; <br /> And that for many a happy year <br /> You need not to her fount repair, <br /> Unless to see as now you see <br /> Each varied form of vanity, <br /> And candid laugh, as now you do, <br /> At all the fools her walks can shew.</p> 
         <p>Yet one wish more – May Fortune kind <br /> Soon briskly blow a North-east wind;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> <br /> And then some few days past &amp; gone <br /> Youll scarce pull Coifs for St Simon.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      </div>
      <p>You must observe this is not the St Simon mentioned in a Book you have formerly read
         calld the Testament, But another quite of a different family and whose name is pronounced
         Sĕnsĭmmong like a Dactyle.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Well, how do you like my Verses? Whether shall I call them, To Lady H on her Birthday;
         or a Lampoon on Lady R &amp; Lady C? one talks of nothing but Lampoons here, pray unde
         derivatur Lampoon?<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> You have a pretty knack at an oldfashioned Welch Ode,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but you are nothing like me at an Impromptu. If you write to me Direct to The young
         Man that my Aunt Dent had like to have ravishd. Axton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> writ to me yesterday about his fellowship. twas rather a sesquipedalian Letter; however
         I answerd it today, &amp; hopd he would behave gratefully to Mr Brown who I sayd was much
         his friend, &amp; would secure him his fellowship.</p>
