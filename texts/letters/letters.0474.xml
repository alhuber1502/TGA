         <opener>
            <dateline>Paris, January 25, 1766. </dateline>
         </opener>
         <p>I am much indebted to you for your kind letter and advice; and though it is late to thank you for it, it is at least a stronger proof
					that I do not forget it. However, I am a little obstinate, as you know, on the chapter of health, and have persisted through this
					Siberian winter in not adding a grain to my clothes, and in going open-breasted without an under-waistcoat. In short, though I like
					extremely to live, it must be in my own way, as long as I can: it is not youth I court, but liberty; and I think making one's self
					tender, is issuing a <hi rend="italic">general warrant</hi> against one's own person. I suppose I shall submit to confinement, when I
					cannot help it; but I am indifferent enough to life not to care if it ends soon after my prison begins.</p>
         <p>I have not delayed so long to answer your letter, from not thinking of it, or from want of matter, but from want of time. I am
					constantly occupied, engaged, amused, till I cannot bring a hundredth part of what I have to say into the compass of a letter. You will
					lose nothing by this: you know my volubility, when I am full of new subjects; and I have at least many hours of conversation for you at
					my return. One does not learn a whole nation in four or five months; but, for the time, few, I believe, have seen, studied, or got so
					much acquainted with the French as I have. </p>
         <p>By what I said of their religious or rather irreligious opinions, you must not conclude their people of quality, atheistsâ&#x80;&#x93;at
					least not the menâ&#x80;&#x93;Happily for them, poor souls! they are not capable of going so far into thinking. They assent to a great deal,
					because it is the fashion, and because they don't know how to contradict. They are ashamed to defend the Roman catholic religion,
					because it is quite exploded; but I am convinced they believe it in their hearts. They hate the parliaments and the philosophers, and
					are rejoiced that they may still idolize royalty. At present too they are a little triumphant: the court has shown a little spirit, and
					the parliaments much less: but as the duc de Choiseul, who is very fluttering, unsettled, and inclined
					to the philosophers, has made a compromise with the parliament of Bretagne, the parliaments might venture out again, if, as I fancy
					will be the case, they are not glad to drop a cause, of which they began to be a little weary of the inconveniences. </p>
         <p>The generality of the men, and more than the generality, are dull and empty. They have taken up gravity, thinking it was philosophy
					and English, and so have acquired nothing in the room of their natural levity and cheerfulness. However, as their high opinion of their
					own country remains, for which they can no longer assign any reason, they are contemptuous and reserved, instead of being ridiculously,
					consequently pardonably, impertinent. I have wondered, knowing my own countrymen, that we had attained such a superiority.â&#x80;&#x93;I
					wonder no longer, and have a little more respect for English <hi rend="italic">heads</hi> than I had.</p>
         <p>The women do not seem of the same country: if they are less gay than they were, they are more informed, enough to make them very
					conversable. I know six or seven with very superior understandings; some of them with wit, or with softness, or very good sense. </p>
         <p>Madame Geoffrin, of whom you have heard much, is an extraordinary woman, with more common sense than I
					almost ever met with. Great quickness in discovering characters, penetration in going to the bottom of them, and a pencil that never
					fails in a likenessâ&#x80;&#x93;seldom a favourable one. She exacts and preserves, spite of her birth and their nonsensical prejudices about
					nobility, great court and attention. This she acquires by a thousand little arts and offices of friendship; and by a freedom and
					severity, which seems to be her sole end of drawing a concourse to her; for she insists on scolding those she inveigles to her. She has
					little taste and less knowledge, but protects artisans and authors, and courts a few people to have the
					credit of serving her dependents. She was bred under the famous madame Tencin, who advised her never to
					refuse any man; for, said her mistress, though nine in ten should not care a farthing for you, the tenth may live to be an useful
					friend. She did not adopt or reject the whole plan, but fully retained the purport of the maxim. In short, she is an epitome of empire,
					subsisting by rewards and punishments. Her great enemy, madame du Deffand, was for a short time mistress
					of the regent, is now very old and stone blind, but retains all her vivacity, wit, memory, judgment, passions, and agreeableness. She
					goes to operas, plays, suppers, and Versailles; gives suppers twice a week; has every thing new read to her; makes new songs and
					epigrams, aye, admirably, and remembers every one that has been made these fourscore years. She corresponds with Voltaire, dictates
					charming letters to him, contradicts him, is no bigot to him or any body, and laughs both at the clergy and the philosophers. In a
					dispute, into which she easily falls, she is very warm, and yet scarce ever in the wrong: her judgment on every subject is as just as
					possible; on every point of conduct as wrong as possible: for she is all love and hatred, passionate for her friends to enthusiasm,
					still anxious to be loved, I don't mean by lovers, and a vehement enemy, but openly. As she can have no amusement but conversation, the
					least solitude and ennui are insupportable to her, and put her into the power of several worthless people, who eat her suppers when
					they can eat nobody's of higher rank; wink to one another and laugh at her; hate her because she has forty times more partsâ&#x80;&#x93;and
					venture to hate her because she is not rich. She has an old friend whom I must mention, a monsieur Pondevelle, author of the Fat Puni, and the Complaisant, and of those pretty novels, the Comte de Cominge, the Siege of
					Calais, and les Malheurs de l'Amour. Would not you expect this old man to be very agreeable? He can be so, but seldom is: yet he has
					another very different and very amusing talent, the art of parody, and is unique in his kind. He composes tales to the tunes of long
					dances: for instance, he has adapted the Regent's Daphnis and Chloe to one, and made it ten times more indecent; but is so old and
					sings it so well, that it is permitted in all companies. He has succeeded still better in les characteres de la danse, to which he has
					adapted words that express all the characters of love. With all this, he has not the least idea of cheerfulness in conversation; seldom
					speaks but on grave subjects, and not often on them; is a humourist, very supercilious, and wrapt up in admiration of his own country,
					as the only judge of his merit. His air and look are cold and forbidding; but ask him to sing, or praise his works, his eyes and smiles
					open and brighten up. In short, I can show him to you: the self-applauding poet in Hogarth's Rake's Progress, the second print, is so
					like his very features and very wig, that you would know him by it, if you came hitherâ&#x80;&#x93;for he certainly will not go to you. </p>
         <p>Madame de Mirepoix's understanding is excellent of the useful kind, and can be so when she pleases of
					the agreeable kind. She has read, but seldom shows it, and has perfect taste. Her manner is cold, but very civil; and she conceals even
					the blood of Lorrain, without ever forgetting it. Nobody in France knows the world better, and nobody is personally so well with the
					king. She is false, artful, and insinuating beyond measure when it is her interest, but indolent and a coward. She never had any
					passion but gaming, and always loses. For ever paying court, the sole produce of a life of art is to get money from the king to carry
					on a course of paying debts or contracting new ones, which she discharges as fast as she is able. She advertised devotion to get made
					dame du palais to the queen; and the very next day this princess of Lorrain was seen riding backwards with madame Pompadour in the
					latter's coach. When the king was stabbed and heartily frightened, the mistress took a panic too, and consulted d'Argenson, whether she had not best make off in time. He hated her, and said, By all means. Madame de Mirepoix advised
					her to stay. The king recovered his spirits, d'Argenson was banished, and la marechale inherited part of the mistress's
					credit.â&#x80;&#x93;I must interrupt my history of illustrious women with an anecdote of monsieur de Maurepas, with whom I am much acquainted, and who has one of the few heads that approach to good ones, and who luckily for us was disgraced,
					and the marine dropped, because it was his favourite object and province. He employed Pondevelle to make a song on the Pompadour: it
					was clever and bitter, and did not spare even majesty. This was Maurepas absurd enough to sing at supper at Versailles. Banishment
					ensued; and lest he should ever be restored, the mistress persuaded the king that he had poisoned her predecessor madame de
						Chateauroux. Maurepas is very agreeable, and exceedingly cheerful; yet I have seen a transient silent
					cloud when politics are talked of.</p>
         <p>Madame de Boufflers, who was in England, is a sÃ§avante, mistress of the prince of Conti, and very desirous of being his wife. She is two women, the upper and the lower. I need not tell you that the
					lower is galant, and still has pretensions. The upper is very sensible too, and has a measured eloquence that is just and
					pleasingâ&#x80;&#x93;but all is spoiled by an unrelaxed attention to applause. You would think she was always sitting for her picture to her
					biographer.</p>
         <p>Madame de Rochfort is different from all the rest. Her understanding is just and delicate; with a
					finesse of wit that is the result of reflection. Her manner is soft and feminine, and though a sÃ§avante, without any declared
					pretensions. She is the <hi rend="italic">decent</hi> friend of monsieur de Nivernois; for you must not
					believe a syllable of what you read in their novels. It requires the greatest curiosity, or the greatest habitude, to discover the
					smallest connection between the sexes here. No familiarity, but under the veil of friendship, is permitted, and love's dictionary is as
					much prohibited, as at first sight one should think his ritual was. All you hear, and that pronounced with nonchalance, is, that <hi rend="italic">monsieur un tel</hi> has had <hi rend="italic">madame une telle.</hi> The duc de Nivernois has parts, and writes at the
					top of the mediocre, but, as madame Geoffrin says, is <hi rend="italic">manquÃ© par tout; guerrier manquÃ©, ambassadeur manquÃ©, homme
						d'affaires manquÃ©,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">auteur manquÃ©</hi>â&#x80;&#x93; no, he is not <hi rend="italic">homme de naissance
						manquÃ©.</hi> He would think freely, but has some ambition of being governor to the dauphin, and is
					more afraid of his wife and daughter, who are ecclesiastic fagots. The
					former out-chatters the duke of Newcastle; and the latter, madame de Gisors, exhausts Mr. Pitt's eloquence in defence of the
						archbishop of Paris. Monsieur de Nivernois lives in a small circle of dependent admirers, and madame
					de Rochfort is high priestess for a small salary of credit.</p>
         <p>The duchess of Choiseul, the only young one of these heroines, is not very pretty, but has fine eyes,
					and is a little model in wax-work, which not being allowed to speak for some time as incapable, has a hesitation and modesty, the
					latter of which the court has not cured, and the former of which is atoned for by the most interesting sound of voice, and forgotten in
					the most elegant turn and propriety of expression. Oh! it is the gentlest, amiable, civil, little creature that ever came out of a
					fairy egg! So just in its phrases and thoughts, so attentive and good-natured! Every body loves it, but its husband, who prefers his
					own sister the duchesse de Grammont, an amazonian, fierce, haughty dame, who loves and hates
					arbitrarily, and is detested. Madame de Choiseul, passionately fond of her husband, was the martyr of this union, but at last submitted
					with a good grace; has gained a little credit with him, and is still believed to idolize himâ&#x80;&#x93;But I doubt itâ&#x80;&#x93;she takes too
					much pains to profess it.</p>
         <p>I cannot finish my list without adding a much more common characterâ&#x80;&#x93;but more complete in its kind than any of the foregoing,
					the marechale de Luxembourg. She has been very handsome, very abandoned, and very mischievous. Her
					beauty is gone, her lovers are gone, and she thinks the devil is coming. This dejection has softened her into being rather agreeable,
					for she has wit and good-breeding; but you would swear, by the restlessness of her person and the horrors she cannot conceal, that she
					had signed the compact, and expected to be called upon in a week for the performance. </p>
         <p>I could add many pictures, but none so remarkable. In those I send you, there is not a feature bestowed gratis or exaggerated. For
					the beauties, of which there are a few considerable, as mesdames de Brionne, de Monaco, et d'Egmont, they have not yet lost their characters, nor got any.</p>
         <p>You must not attribute my intimacy with Paris to curiosity alone. An accident unlocked the doors for me. That <hi rend="italic">passe-partout,</hi> called the fashion, has made them fly openâ&#x80;&#x93;and what do you think was that fashion?â&#x80;&#x93;I
					myselfâ&#x80;&#x93;Yes, like queen Elinor in the ballad, I sunk at Charing-cross, and have risen in the
					fauxbourg St. Germain. A <hi rend="italic">plaisanterie</hi> on Rousseau, whose arrival here in his way
					to you brought me acquainted with many anecdotes conformable to the idea I had conceived of him, got about, was liked much more than it
					deserved, spread like wildfire, and made me the subject of conversation. Rousseau's devotees were offended. Madame de Boufflers, with a
					tone of sentiment, and the accents of lamenting humanity, abused me heartily, and then complained to myself with the utmost softness. I
					acted contrition, but had like to have spoiled all, by growing dreadfully tired of a second lecture from the prince of Conti, who took
					up the ball, and made himself the hero of a history wherein he had nothing to do. I listened, did not understand half he said (nor he
					neither), forgot the rest, said Yes when I should have said No, yawned when I should have smiled, and was very penitent when I should
					have rejoiced at my pardon. Madame de Boufflers was more distressed, for he owned twenty times more than I had said: she frowned, and
					made him signs; but she had wound up his clack, and there was no stopping it. The moment she grew angry, the [lord of the house] grew charmed, and it has been my fault if I am not at the head of a numerous sect:â&#x80;&#x93;but when I left a
					triumphant party in England, I did not come hither to be at the head of a fashion. However, I have been sent for about like an African
					prince or a learned canary-bird, and was, in particular, carried by force to the princess of Talmond,
					the queen's cousin, who lives in a charitable apartment in the Luxembourg, and was sitting on a small bed hung with saints and
					Sobieskis, in a corner of one of those vast chambers, by two blinking tapers. I stumbled over a cat, a foot-stool, and a chamber-pot in
					my journey to her presence. She could not find a syllable to say to me, and the visit ended with her begging a lap-dog. Thank the Lord!
					though this is the first month, it is the last week, of my reign; and I shall resign my crown with great satisfaction to a bouillie of
					chestnuts, which is just invented, and whose annals will be illustrated by so many indigestions, that Paris will not want any thing
					else these three weeks. I will enclose the fatal letter after I have finished this enormous one; to which I will only add, that nothing
					has interrupted my SevignÃ©-researches but the frost. The abbÃ© de Malesherbes has given me full power to ransack Livry. I did not tell
					you, that by great accident, when I thought on nothing less, I stumbled on an original picture of the comte de Grammont.</p>
