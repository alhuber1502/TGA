            <dateline>Florence, April 21, 1741. </dateline>
         </opener>
         <p>I know not what degree of satisfaction it will give you to be told that we shall set out from hence the 24th of this month, and not
					stop above a fortnight at any place in our way. This I feel, that you are the principal pleasure I have to hope for in my own country.
					Try at least to make me imagine myself not indifferent to you; for I must own I have the vanity of desiring to be esteemed by somebody,
					and would choose that somebody should be one whom I esteem as much as I do you. As I am recommending myself to your love, methinks I
					ought to send you my picture (for I am no more what I was, some circumstances excepted, which I hope I need not particularize to you);
					you must add then, to your former idea, two years of age, reasonable quantity of dullness, a great deal of silence, and something that
					rather resembles, than is, thinking; a confused notion of many strange and fine things that have swum before my eyes for some time, a
					want of love for general society, indeed an inability to it. On the good side you may add a sensibility for what others feel, and
					indulgence for their faults or weaknesses, a love of truth, and detestation of every thing else. Then you are to deduct a little
					impertinence, a little laughter, a great deal of pride, and some spirits. These are all the alterations I know of, you perhaps may find
					more. Think not that I have been obliged for this reformation of manners to reason or reflection, but to a severer school-mistress,
					Experience. One has little merit in learning her lessons, for one cannot well help it; but they are more useful than others, and
					imprint themselves in the very heart. I find I have been harangueing in the style of the Son of Sirach, so shall finish here, and tell you that our route is settled as follows: First to Bologna for a few days, to hear the
						Viscontina sing; next to Reggio, where is a Fair. Now, you must know, a Fair here is not a place
					where one eats ginger-bread or rides upon hobby-horses; here are no musical clocks, nor tall Leicestershire women; one has nothing but
					masquing, gaming, and singing. If you love operas, there will be the most splendid in Italy, four tip-top voices, a new theatre, the
					Duke and Duchess in all their pomps and vanities. Does not this sound magnificent? Yet is the city of Reggio but one step above Old
						Brentford. Well; next to Venice by the 11th of May, there to see the old Doge wed the Adriatic Whore. Then to Verona, so to Milan, so to Marseilles, so to Lyons, so to Paris, so to West,
					&amp;c. in sÃ¦cula sÃ¦culorum. Amen.</p>
         <p>Eleven months, at different times, have I passed at Florence; and yet (God help me) know not either people or language. Yet the place
					and the charming prospects demand a poetical farewell, and here it is. </p>
         <q>
            <p> Oh FÃ¦sulÃ¦ amÅ&#x93;na <lb/> Frigoribus juga, nec nimiÃ¹m spirantibus auris! <lb/> Alma quibus Tusci Pallas decus Apennini <lb/> Esse
						dedit, glaucÃ¢que suÃ¢ canescere sylvÃ¢! <lb/> Non ego vos posthÃ c Arni de valle videbo <lb/> Porticibus circum, &amp; candenti cincta
						coronÃ¢ <lb/> Villarum longÃ© nitido consurgere dorso, <lb/> Antiquamve Ã&#x86;dem, et veteres prÃ¦ferre Cupressus <lb/> Mirabor, tectisque
						super pendentia tecta. </p>
         </q>
         <p>I will send you, too, a pretty little Sonnet of a Sigr. Abbate Buondelmonte, with my imitation of
					it.</p>
         <q>
            <p>Spesso Amor sotto la forma <lb/> D'amistÃ  ride, e s'asconde: <lb/> Poi si mischia, e si confonde <lb/> Con lo sdegno, e col
						rancor. <lb/> In Pietade ei si trasforma; <lb/> Par trastullo, e par dispetto: <lb/> MÃ  nel suo diverso aspetto <lb/> Sempr' egli
						Ã¨ l'istesso Amor. </p>
            <p>Lusit amicitiÃ¦ interdum velatus amictu, <lb/> Et benÃ¨ compositÃ¢ veste fefellit Amor. <lb/> Mox irÃ¦ assumsit cultus, faciemque
						minantem, <lb/> Inque odium versus, versus &amp; in lacrymas: <lb/> Ludentem fuge, nec lacrymanti, aut crede furenti; <lb/> Idem
						est dissimili semper in ore Deus. </p>
         </q>
         <p>Here comes a letter from you.â&#x80;&#x93;I must defer giving my opinion of Pausanias till I can see the whole, and only have said what I
					did in obedience to your commands. I have spoken with such freedom on this head, that it seems but
					just you should have your revenge; and therefore I send you the beginning not of an Epic Poem, but of a Metaphysic one. Poems and Metaphysics (say you, with your spectacles on) are inconsistent things. A metaphysical poem is a
					contradiction in terms. It is true, but I will go on. It is Latin too to increase the absurdity. It will, I suppose, put you in mind of
					the man who wrote a treatise of Canon Law in Hexameters. Pray help me to the description of a mixt mode, and a little Episode about
						Space.
