         <div class="salute">Dear Mr Gray </div>
      </div>
      <p>It is not true that I again make interest to be transported into Ireland;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and yet I beleive too it will be my fate. I am totally passive in the whole affair,
         and shall remain so, the only step I ever took, wch could be calld active, was to
         write a Letter to Mr Bonfoy,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> simply to enquire whether it was true that the Marquiss<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> intended to take me next; wch he has now answerd in the affirmative; but as Louth<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is still to continue first Chaplain, the time when is uncertain, &amp; cannot be these
         two years, in wch space you know a Man may die or do a hundred pretty things. – But
         I hear, since I came into these parts, that Seward the Critic<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is very anxious about taking my Place, &amp; has made offers of making over to me a great
         living in the Peak,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if he may go in my stead. Here too I preserve my Passivity. It being totally indifferent
         to me whether they thrust me into the Devil's A–e,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or an Irish Bog.</p>
      <p>Yet, tho I say I am indifferent to both these, I will in my present circumstances
         embrace either. The world has nothing to give me that I really care for, therefore
         Whatever she gives me, or however she gives it, does not matter a rush. And yet I
         own I would have some thing more of her too, merely because I have not Philosophy,
         or a better thing Œconomy, to make what I have a Competency.</p>
      <p>[           ]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>Whitehead has sent me some Verses from Vienna,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> treating of my Indolence, &amp; other weighty matters, &amp; exhorting me not to detach myself
         too much from the World. The Verses are really very easy, &amp; natural, &amp; I would transcribe
         them for you if it was not too much trouble. &amp; yet you would not like them, if I did;
         because of some Words, wch I know would not digest upon your Stomach; neither do they
         on mine; for I dont know how it is, but the slops you have given me have made my Digestive
         facultys so weak, that several things of that sort, wch were once as easy to me as
         hasty pudding, never get thro the first concoction, &amp; lay as heavy in the prima Via
         as toasted Cheese. All wch I impute to your Nursery, where you would never let one
         eat any thing that was solid, as I did at St Johns.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>"Write (you say) something stately at Aston."<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I writ nothing there but Sermons, &amp; those I only transcribd. Write yourself if you
         please, at least finish your Welch Ode<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; send it me to Hull, for there is an Alderman there, that I want to give his opinion
         about it.</p>
      <p>But pray Why Mr Gray! must I write &amp; you Not? Upon my word Sr! I really dont mean
         it as a flattery or any thing of that sort, no Sr I detest the insinuation. but, Blast
         my Laurells Sr if I dont think you write vastly better than I do. I swear by Apollo
         (my dear Sr) That I would give all my Elfrida<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (Odes included) to be the Author of that pretty Elegy, that Miss Plumbtree can say
         off book. And I protest to you, that my Ode on Memory<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> after it has gone through all the Limæ Labor that our friend Horace prescribes, Nay
         Si prematur Nonum in Annum<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (above half of wch time it has already I assure you been conceald Malgre my Partiality
         to it), I say that that very Ode is not, nor ever will be, half so terse, &amp; complete
         as the fragment of your Welch Ode; wch is as one may say now just warm from your Brain,
         &amp; one would expect as callow as a newhatchd Chicken (pardon the barndoor Simile) but
         all your productions are of a different sort, they come from you Armd Capapee at all
         points, as Minerva is said to have issued from the Head of Jupiter. I have thus said
         enough to shew you that however I may have laid aside the practical part of poetry
         I retain all that internal force, that Ignea vis, wch inspires evry true Son of parnassus
         with all wch I am fervently yours</p>
