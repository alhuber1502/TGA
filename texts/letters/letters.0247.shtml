      <p>If all the Greek you transcribed for me were Poetry already I would bestir myself
         to oblige you &amp; Mr Rivett, but as it is no more than measured Prose, &amp; as unfortunately
         (in English verse) a Tripod with two ears, or more, has no more dignity than a Chamber-pot
         with one, I do not see, why you would have me Dress it up with any florid additions,
         wch it must have, if it would appear in rhyme; nor why it will not prove its point
         as well in a plain prose translation, as in the best numbers of Dryden. if you think
         otherwise, why don't you do it yourself, &amp; consult me, if you think fit. I rejoice
         to hear the Prints succeed so well, &amp; am impatient for the work, but do not approve
         the <span style="font-style:italic">fine Lady</span> part of it. what business have such people with Athens? I applaud your scheme for
         Gaskarth, &amp; wish it could have succeeded. he bears his disappointment like a Philosopher,
         but his health is very bad. I have had the honour myself of some little grumblings
         of the Gout for this fortnight, &amp; yesterday it would not let me put on a shoe to hear
         the Frasi in, so you may imagine I am in a sweet amiable humour. nevertheless I think
         of being in Town (perhaps I may not be able to stir) the middle of next week with
         Montagu. you are so cross-grain'd as to go to Tunbridge just before I come, but I
         will give you the trouble to enquire about my old quarters at Roberts's, if I can
         probably have a lodging at that time. if not there; may be I can be in <span style="font-style:italic">the Oven,</span>  wch will do well enough for a Sinner. be so good to give me notice, &amp; the sooner
         the better. I shall not stay above a week, &amp; then go to Stoke. I rejoice to know,
         that the genial influences of the Spring, wch produce nothing but the Gout in me,
         have hatched high &amp; unimaginable fantasies in you. I see methinks (as I sit on Snowden)
         some Glimpse of Mona, &amp; her haunted shades &amp; hopes we shall be very good Neighbours.
         any Druidical Anecdotes that I can meet with, I will be sure to send you. I am of
         your opinion, that the Ghosts will spoil the Picture, unless they are thrown at a
         huge distance, &amp; extremely <span style="font-style:italic">kept down.</span> 
      </p>
      <p>The British Flag (I fear) has behaved itself like a Train'd-band Pair of Colours in
         Bunhill-fields. I think every day of going to Switzerland. will you be of the party,
         or stay &amp; sing Mass at Aston?
