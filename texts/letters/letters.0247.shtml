      <p>If all the Greek you transcribed<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> for me were Poetry already I would bestir myself to oblige you &amp; Mr Rivett,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but as it is no more than measured Prose, &amp; as unfortunately (in English verse) a
         Tripod with two ears, or more, has no more dignity than a Chamber-pot with one, I
         do not see, why you would have me Dress it up with any florid additions, wch it must
         have, if it would appear in rhyme; nor why it will not prove its point as well in
         a plain prose translation, as in the best numbers of Dryden. if you think otherwise,
         why don't you do it yourself, &amp; consult me, if you think fit. I rejoice to hear the
         Prints succeed so well, &amp; am impatient for the work, but do not approve the <span style="font-style:italic">fine Lady</span> part of it.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> what business have such people with Athens? I applaud your scheme for Gaskarth,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; wish it could have succeeded. he bears his disappointment like a Philosopher, but
         his health is very bad. I have had the honour myself of some little grumblings of
         the Gout for this fortnight, &amp; yesterday it would not let me put on a shoe to hear
         the Frasi<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in, so you may imagine I am in a sweet amiable humour. nevertheless I think of being
         in Town (perhaps I may not be able to stir) the middle of next week<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> with Montagu.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> you are so cross-grain'd as to go to Tunbridge just before I come, but I will give
         you the trouble to enquire about my old quarters at Roberts's,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> if I can probably have a lodging at that time. if not there; may be I can be in <span style="font-style:italic">the Oven,</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> wch will do well enough for a Sinner. be so good to give me notice, &amp; the sooner
         the better. I shall not stay above a week, &amp; then go to Stoke. I rejoice to know,
         that the genial influences of the Spring, wch produce nothing but the Gout in me,
         have hatched high &amp; unimaginable fantasies in you.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I see methinks (as I sit on Snowden) some Glimpse of Mona, &amp; her haunted shades &amp;
         hopes we shall be very good Neighbours. any Druidical Anecdotes that I can meet with,
         I will be sure to send you. I am of your opinion, that the Ghosts will spoil the Picture,
         unless they are thrown at a huge distance, &amp; extremely <span style="font-style:italic">kept down.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>The British Flag<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (I fear) has behaved itself like a Train'd-band Pair of Colours in Bunhill-fields.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I think every day of going to Switzerland.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> will you be of the party, or stay &amp; sing Mass at Aston?</p>
