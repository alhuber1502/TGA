				     <p>I will not give you the trouble of sending your chaise for me. I intend to be with you on Wednesday
					in the evening. If the press stands still all this time for me, to be sure it is dead in
					child-bed.</p>
				     <p>I do not love notes, though you see I had resolved to put two or three. They are signs of weakness
					and obscurity. If a thing cannot be understood without them, it had better be not understood at all. If you will be vulgar, and
					pronounce it <hi rend="italic">Lunnun,</hi>
					 instead of London, I can't help it. Caradoc I have private reasons
					against; and besides it is in reality Carādoc, and will not stand in the verse.</p>
				     <p>I rejoice you can fill all your <hi rend="italic">vuides.</hi>
					 the Maintenon could not, and that was her great misfortune. Seriously though, I congratulate you on
					your happiness, and seem to understand it. The receipt is obvious: it is only, Have something to do;
					but how few can apply it! –</p>
