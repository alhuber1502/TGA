      <p>I wrote to you from London lately not knowing but you might care to go with me into
         Yorkshire tomorrow, but as I neither find you here, nor any letter from you, I conclude
         that is not to be. I would wish by all means to oblige &amp; serve T: in any way I am
         able, but it can not be <span style="font-style:italic">in his way</span> at present. he &amp; you seem to think, that I have nothing else to do but to transcribe
         a page from some common-place-book on this head: if it were so, I should not hesitate
         a minute about it. but as I came from Town only on Thursday last, have only two days
         to pass here, &amp; must fetch all the materials from my own recollection, he must excuse
         me for the present. let him begin with Ld Bacon's Henry 7th, &amp; Ld Herbert's Henry
         8th, &amp; by that time I return from Aston (wch will be in 3 weeks or less) perhaps I
         may be able to help him onwards a little. I keep the letter till we meet, least it
         be lost. I would reply nothing to the article of <span style="font-style:italic">separation</span> ( [ ] for himself. [ ] point.
