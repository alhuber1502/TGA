					       <dateline>Cambridge. March 1. 1759 </dateline>
					       <salute>Dear Mason </salute>
				     </opener>
				     <p>Did I tell you I had been confined in Town with the Gout for a fortnight? well, &amp; since I came hither, it is come again. yesterday I came abroad again for the first time in a great shoe, &amp; very much out of
					humour; and so I must return again in three days to town about <hi rend="italic">business,</hi> wch is not like to add much to the
					sweetness of my temper, especially while Stocks are so low.</p>
				     <p>I did not remember ever to have seen the joint-criticism from Prior-park, that you speak of; so little impression did it make: nor
					should I believe now, that I had ever seen it, did I not recollect, what a prejudice the Parsons
					express'd to human sacrifice, wch is quite agreeable to my way of thinking, since Caractacus convinced me of the propriety of the
					thing. it is certain, that their fancies did in no sort influence me in the use of my Tomahawk. now you must know, I do not much admire
					the Chorus of ye <hi rend="italic">rocking-stone,</hi> nor yet much disapprove it. it is grave &amp; solemn and may pass. I insist
					however, that <hi rend="italic">deigns</hi> (tho' it be a rhyme) should be <hi rend="italic">deign'st,</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">fills fill'st,</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">bids bid'st.</hi> do not blame me, but the English Tongue. the beginning of the
					Antistrophe is good: I do not like <q>
						         <p>
							           <hi rend="italic">m√¶andring</hi> way,<lb/> Where <hi rend="italic">Vice</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Folly</hi> stray.</p>
            </q> nor
					the word <hi rend="italic">sprite.</hi> the beginning too of ye Epode is well, but you have used the epithet <hi rend="italic">pale</hi> before in a sense somewhat similar &amp; I do not love repetitions. the line <hi rend="italic">Or magic numbers</hi>
					interrupts the run of ye Stanza, &amp; lets the measure drop too short. there is no beauty in repeating <hi rend="italic">ponderous
						sphere.</hi> the two last lines are the best.</p>
				     <p>The sense of your simile about the distant thunder is not clear, nor well-expressed: besides it implies too strong a confession of
					guilt.</p>
				     <p>The Stanza you sent me for ye 2d Ode is very rude, &amp; neither the Idea, nor verses touch me much.
					it is not the Gout, that makes me thus difficult, finish but your <hi rend="italic">Death-Song</hi> as well as you imagined &amp; begun
					it; &amp; mind, if I won't be more pleased than any body </p>
				     <closer>
					       <salute>Adieu, dear Mason, I am ever<lb/> Truly Yours </salute>
					       <signed>TG: </signed>
				     </closer>
				     <postscript>
					       <p>Did I tell you, how well I liked Whithead's two Odes? they are far better than any thing he ever
						wrote.</p>
					       <p>Mr Brown &amp; Jemmy Bickham lament your indolence, as to the degree, in Chorus. as to me, I should
						have done just so for all the World.</p>
