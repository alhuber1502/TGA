      <p>In consideration of the time your Petitioner has past in your honours Service, as
         also on account of the great Services your petitioner's relations have had the honour
         to perform for your Honour's Ancestors; since it is well known that your petitrs Grandmother's
         Aunt's Cousin-german had ye honour to pull out your honour's great Uncle's Wive's
         brother's hollow tooth; as also, to go further backwards, your Petrs relation was
         Physician to King Cadwallader, one of your highnesses fore-fathers, and cured him
         of a fishes-bone, which had stuck in his throat fifteen years, &amp; three days and would
         neither come up, nor down: also the Emperour Maximus, a very near relation of your
         serene Haughtinesses, entertain'd your Petitrs progenitor in his army, as a Jester,
         who is said to have had so much wit, that he could devour ten peck-loaves at a Meal,
         &amp; toss off as many hog-sheads of strong beer without taking breath: I could enumerate
         more than all this, but hope, this will be sufficient to prevail upon your generosity
         to make me your first Minister, and Confidant
      </p>
      <p>And your Petr shall <span style="font-style:italic">ever pray</span></p>
      <p>Thou hast been for this month, like an auctioneer's mallet, just a-coming! just a-coming!
         and pray what has next Thursday in it, more than last Wednesday, to make me expect
         you with any tolerable Certainty? when these two eyes behold thee, I question, whether
         I shall believe them: three long months is a long while, for a poor lone woman<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to bear; and I have born, &amp; born, and been fub'd off, &amp; fub'd off from this day to
         that day by you, thou Honey-suckle Villain (as Mrs Quickly says) oh! thou art an infinitive
         thing upon my score of impatience.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> remember you are a day in my debt for every hour you have made me wait, &amp; I shall
         come upon you for the payment, &amp; perhaps with interest:â€”I begin to bear my Crest aloft
         when I hear of your pride; I dare not tell Ashton<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> anything about it, for he hopes to see you behave with great affability to every
         body, &amp; you'll have many lectures upon that Subject: I begin to pity the poor Man,
         that is to be with you: he is extremely modest, &amp; as humble as you could wish; you
         may snub him with a look; I fancy he will intrude very little. make hast &amp; pack up
         your things, the Coach is at the door: drive away to [...]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
