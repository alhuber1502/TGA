      <p>You will wonder, why I trouble you so soon with another letter. it is about the great
         box, wch I committed to the care of your John, &amp; wch does not yet make its appearance
         at Cambridge: in it are all my shoes, clogs, Encyclopedie, &amp; other rich moveables,
         &amp; I begin to fear it has miscarried. I shall be much obliged to you, if you will let
         him make enquiry after it.
      </p>
      <p>What are we to believe about Silesia? am I to make bonfires, or keep a general fast?
         pray, rid me of this suspence, for it is very uneasy to me.
