         <div class="dateline">Tivoli, May 20, 1740.</div>
      </div>
      <p>This day being in the palace of his Highness the Duke of Modena,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he laid his most serene commands upon me to write to Mr. West, and said he thought
         it for his glory, that I should draw up an inventory of all his most serene possessions
         for the said West's perusal.–Imprimis, a house, being in circumference a quarter of
         a mile, two feet and an inch; the said house containing the following particulars,
         to wit, a great room. Item, another great room; item, a bigger room; item, another
         room; item, a vast room; item, a sixth of the same; a seventh ditto; an eighth as
         before; a ninth as abovesaid; a tenth (see No. 1.); item, ten more such, besides twenty
         besides, which, not to be too particular, we shall pass over. The said rooms contain
         nine chairs, two tables, five stools, and a cricket. From whence we shall proceed
         to the garden, containing two millions of superfine laurel hedges, a clump of cypress
         trees, and half the river Teverone, that pisses into two thousand several chamberpots.
         Finis.–Dame Nature desired me to put in a list of her little goods and chattels, and,
         as they were small, to be very minute about them. She has built here three or four
         little mountains, and laid them out in an irregular semi-circle; from certain others
         behind, at a greater distance, she has drawn a canal, into which she has put a little
         river of hers, called Anio; she has cut a huge cleft between the two innermost of
         her four hills, and there she has left it to its own disposal; which she has no sooner
         done, but, like a heedless chit, it tumbles headlong down a declivity fifty feet perpendicular,
         breaks itself all to shatters, and is converted into a shower of rain, where the sun
         forms many a bow, red, green, blue and yellow. To get out of our metaphors without
         any further trouble, it is the most noble sight in the world. The weight of that quantity
         of waters, and the force they fall with, have worn the rocks they throw themselves
         among into a thousand irregular craggs, and to a vast depth. In this channel it goes
         boiling along with a mighty noise till it comes to another steep, where you see it
         a second time come roaring down (but first you must walk two miles farther) a greater
         height than before, but not with that quantity of waters; for by this time it has
         divided itself, being crossed and opposed by the rocks, into four several streams,
         each of which, in emulation of the great one, will tumble down too; and it does tumble
         down, but not from an equally elevated place; so that you have at one view all these
         cascades intermixed with groves of olive and little woods, the mountains rising behind
         them, and on the top of one (that which forms the extremity of one of the half-circle's
         horns) is seated the town itself. At the very extremity of that extremity, on the
         brink of the precipice, stands the Sybils' temple, the remains of a little rotunda,
         surrounded with its portico, above half of whose beautiful Corinthian pillars are
         still standing and entire; all this on one hand. On the other, the open Campagna of
         Rome, here and there a little castle on a hillock, and the city itself on the very
         brink of the horizon, indistinctly seen (being 18 miles off) except the dome of St.
         Peter's; which, if you look out of your window, wherever you are, I suppose, you can
         see. I did not tell you that a little below the first fall, on the side of the rock,
         and hanging over that torrent, are little ruins which they shew you for Horace's house,
         a curious situation to observe the</p>

      <p>Mæcenas did not care for such a noise, it seems, and built him a house (which they
         also carry one to see) so situated that it sees nothing at all of the matter, and
         for any thing he knew there might be no such river in the world. Horace had another
         house on the other side of the Teverone, opposite to Mæcenas's; and they told us there
         was a bridge of communication, by which 'andava il detto Signor per trastullarsi coll'
         istesso Orazio'. In coming hither we crossed the Aquæ Albulæ, a vile little brook
         that stinks like a fury, and they say it has stunk so these thousand years. I forgot
         the Piscina of Quintilius Varus, where he used to keep certain little fishes. This
         is very entire, and there is a piece of the aqueduct that supplied it too; in the
         garden below is old Rome, built in little, just as it was, they say. There are seven
         temples in it, and no houses at all: They say there were none. </p>

         <p>We have had the pleasure of going twelve miles out of our way to Palestrina. It has
            rained all day as if heaven and us were coming together. See my honesty, I do not
            mention a syllable of the temple of Fortune, because I really did not see it; which,
            I think, is pretty well for an old traveller. So we returned along the Via Prænestina,
            saw the Lacus Gabinus and Regillus, where, you know, Castor and Pollux appeared upon
            a certain occasion.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> And many a good old tomb we left on each hand, and many an Aqueduct,</p>
         <div class="q">
            <p>Dumb are whose fountains, and their channels dry. </p>
         </div>
         <p>There are, indeed, two whole modern ones, works of Popes, that run about thirty miles
            a-piece in length; one of them conveys still the famous Aqua Virgo to Rome, and adds
            vast beauty to the prospect. So we came to Rome again, where waited for us a splendidissimo
            regalo of letters; in one of which came You, with your huge characters and wide intervals,
            staring. I would have you to know, I expect you should take a handsome crow-quill
            when you write to me, and not leave room for a pin's point in four sides of a sheet
            royal. Do you but find matter, I will find spectacles. </p>
         <p>I have more time than I thought, and I will employ it in telling you about a Ball
            that we were at the other evening. Figure to yourself a Roman villa; all its little
            apartments thrown open, and lighted up to the best advantage. At the upper end of
            the gallery, a fine concert, in which La Diamantina, a famous virtuosa, played on
            the violin divinely, and sung angelically; Giovannino and Pasqualini (great names
            in musical story) also performed miraculously. On each side were ranged all the secular
            grand monde of Rome, the Ambassadors, Princesses, and all that. Among the rest Il
            Serenissimo Pretendente (as the Mantova gazette calls him) displayed his rueful length
            of person, with his two young ones,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> and all his ministry around him. 'Poi nacque un grazioso ballo,' where the world
            danced, and I sat in a corner regaling myself with iced fruits, and other pleasant
            rinfrescatives.</p>
