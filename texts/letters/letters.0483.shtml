         <div class="salute">Dear Mason </div>
      </div>
      <p>I was going to write to you, when I received your letter, and on the same subject.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the first news I had was from St:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> on the 23d. of Sept: in these words:
      </p>
      <p>'This morning Dr B: dispatch'd himself: he had been for several days past very low-spirited,
         &amp; within the last two or three talk'd of the necessity of dying in such a manner as
         to alarm the people about him: they removed as they thought every thing, that might
         serve his purpose. but he had contrived to get at a razor unknown to them, &amp; took
         the advantage of a minute's absence of his servants to make use of it.' I wrote to
         him again (I suspect, he knows our secret,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> tho' not from me) to make farther enquiries, &amp; he says, 27 Sept:, 'I have tried to
         find out, whether there was any appearance or cause of discontent in B:, but can hear
         of none. a bodily complaint of the gouty kind, that fell upon his nerves &amp; affected
         his spirits in a very great degree is all that I can get any information of; &amp; I am
         told besides, that he was some years ago in the same dejected way, &amp; under the care
         of <span style="font-style:italic">proper attendants.</span>' Mr. W: too in answer to a letter I had written to enquire after his health after
         giving an account of himself, while under the care of Pringle,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> adds, 'He (Pringle) had another Patient at the same time, who has ended very unhappily,
         that poor Dr B:. the unfortunate Man apprehended himself going mad, &amp; two nights after
         cut his throat in bed.' this is all I know at present of the matter. I have told it
         you literally, &amp; I conceal nothing. as I go to town tomorrow, if I learn any thing
         more, you shall soon hear from me. in the mean time I think we may fairly conclude,
         that if he had had <span style="font-style:italic">any other</span> cause added to his constitutional infirmity, it would have been uppermost in his
         mind: he would have talk'd or raved about it, &amp; the first thing we should have heard
         of, would have been this, wch (I do assure you) I have never heard from any body.
         there is in this neighbourhood a Mr Wale,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who once was in the Russia-trade &amp; married a Woman of that country: he always maintain'd,
         that Dr B: would never go thither, whatever he might pretend; &amp; that tho' fond of
         the glory of being invited thither, he would certainly find or make a pretence for
         staying at home. very possibly therefore he might have engaged himself so far, that
         he knew not how to draw back with honour; or might have received rough words from
         the Russian Minister offended with his prevarication. this supposition<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is at least as likely as yours; added to what I have said before, much more so: if
         it be necessary to suppose any other cause than the lunatick disposition of the Man.
         and yet I will not disguise to you, that I felt as you do on the first news of this
         sad accident, &amp; had the same uneasy ideas about it.
      </p>
      <p>I am sorry the cause you mention<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> should be the occasion of your coming to London: tho' perhaps change of air may do
         more than medicine. in this length of time I should think you must be fully apprised,
         whether her looks or strength or embon-point have suffer'd by this cough: if not;
         surely there is no real danger. yet I do not wonder, she should wish to get rid of
         so troublesome a companion.
      </p>
      <p>When I can meet with the book, I will transcribe what you mention from <span style="font-style:italic">Mallet.</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I shall write again soon. do you know of any great, or at least rich, family that
         want a young Man worth his weight in gold to take care of their eldest hope. if you
         do, remember I have such a one,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> or shall have (I fear) shortly to sell: but they must not stand haggling about him,
         &amp; besides they must be very good sort of people too, or they shall not have him.
      </p>
