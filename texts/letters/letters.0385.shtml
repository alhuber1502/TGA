      </div>
      <p>I thank you for your kind enquiries &amp; impatience about me. had I not been so often
         disappointed before, when I thought myself sure, I should have informed you before
         this time of my motions. I thought I was just setting out for Cambridge, when the
         Man (on whom I have a mortgage) gave me notice, that he was ready to pay in his money:
         so that now I must necessarily stay to receive it, &amp; it will be (to be sure) the middle
         of June before I can see Cambridge, where I have long wish'd to be. Montagu had thoughts
         of going thither with me, but I know not what his present intentions may be: he is
         in real affliction for the loss of Sr W: Williams, who has left him one of his Executors,
         &amp; (as I doubt his affairs were a good deal embarrass'd), he possibly may be detain'd
         in Town on that account. Mason too talk'd of staying part of the summer with me at
         Pembroke, but this may perhaps be only talk. My Lord goes into Yorkshire this summer,
         so I suppose the Parson must go with him. you will not see any advertisement till
         next winter at soonest. Southwell is going to Ireland for two months, much against
         his will. I have not seen my new Lady E:, but her Husband I have; so (I'm afraid)
         I soon must have that honor. God send Fobus may lie in just about the Commencement,
         or I go out of my wits. that's all .. the news of the surrender of Bellisle is daily
         expected. they have not, nor (they say) possibly can throw in either Men or provisions,
         so it is look'd upon as ours. I know it will be so next week, because I am then to
         buy into the Stocks.
