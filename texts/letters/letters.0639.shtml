         <div class="salute">Dear Sr </div>
      </div>
      <p>The inclosed came a few days after you left us,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> as I apprehend, from Temple. I continue here much against my will. the gout is gone,
         the feverish disorder abated, but not cured; my spirits much oppress'd, &amp; the more
         so, as I foresee a new complaint, that may tie me down perhaps to my bed, &amp; expose
         me to the operations of a Surgeon. God knows, what will be the end of it.</p>
      <p>It will be an alleviation to my miseries, if I can hear, you are well, &amp; capable of
         enjoying those objects of curiosity, that the countries you are in<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> promise to afford you. the greater the detail you give me of them, the happier I
         shall be. Mr. Clarke call'd on me yesterday,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; desires to be remember'd. I know nothing new here, but that Mr. T: Pitt<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is going to be married to a Miss Wilkinson, the daughter of a rich Merchant, who
         gives her 30,000Â£ down, &amp; at least as much more in expectation.</p>
