      <p>Having made many enquiries about the authenticity of these Fragments;<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> I have got a letter from Mr David Hume (the Historian) wch is more satisfactory than
         any thing I have yet met with on that subject. he says,</p>
      <p>Certain it is, that these poems are in every body's mouth in the High-lands, have
         been handed down from Father to Son, &amp; are of an age beyond all memory &amp; tradition.
         Adam Smith,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the celebrated Professor in Glasgow, told me, that the Piper of the Argyleshire Militia
         repeated to him all those, wch Mr Macpherson has translated, &amp; many more of equal
         beauty. Major Mackay (Ld Rae's Brother)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> told me, that he remembers them perfectly well; as likewise did the Laird of Macfarline<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (the greatest Antiquarian we have in this country) &amp; who insists strongly on the
         historical truth, as well as the poetical beauty of these productions. I could add
         the Laird &amp; Lady Macleod, with many more, that live in different parts of the highlands,
         very remote from each other, &amp; could only be acquainted with what had become (in a
         manner) national works. there is a Country-Surgeon in Lochaber, who has by heart the
         entire Epic Poem mention'd by Mr Macpherson in his Preface, &amp; as he is old; is perhaps
         the only person living, that knows it all; &amp; has never committed it to writing; we
         are in the more hast to recover a Monument, wch will certainly be regarded as a curiosity
         in the Republick of Letters: we have therefore set about a subscription of a Guinea
         or two Guineas apiece in order to enable Mr Macpherson to undertake a Mission into
         the Highlands to recover this poem, &amp; other fragments of antiquity.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>I forgot to mention to you that the names of Fingal, Oscian, Oscur, &amp;c: are still
         given in the Highlands to large Mastiffs, as we give to ours the names of CÃ¦sar, Pompey,
         Hector &amp;c: </p>
