      <p>You perceive by Mr Brown's letter, that I pass'd all the summer in the North of England,
         went from thence to London, &amp; did not arrive here till the middle of December, where
         I found your parcel. since that time I have been generally confined to my room, &amp;
         besides I was willing to go thro' the eight volumes before I return'd you an answer.
         this must be my excuse to you, for only doing now, what in mere civility I ought to
         have done long ago. first I must condole with you, that so neat an edition should
         swarm in almost every page with errors of the press, not only in notes &amp; citations
         from Greek, French, &amp; English authors, but in the Italian text itself, greatly to
         the disreputation of the Leghorn Publishers. this is the only reason (I think) that
         could make an edition in England necessary: but I doubt you would not find the matter
         much mended here, our presses, as they improve in beauty, declining daily in accuracy:
         besides you would find the expence very considerable, &amp; the sale in no proportion
         to it, as in reality it is but few people in England, that read currently &amp; with pleasure
         the Italian tongue; &amp; the fine old editions of their capital Writers are sold at London
         for a lower price, than they bear in Italy. an English translation I can by no means
         advise. the justness of thought &amp; good sense might remain; but the graces of elocution
         (wch make a great part of Algarotti's merit) would be entirely lost, &amp; that merely
         from the very different genius &amp; complexion of the two languages.
      </p>
      <p>I rather think these volumes should be handsomely bound, before they are put into
         the Library: they bind very neatly here; &amp; if you approve it, Mr Brown will order
         it to be done. doubtless there can be no impropriety in making the same present to
         the University, nor need you at all to fear for the reputation of your Friend: he
         has merit enough to recommend him in any country, a tincture of various sorts of knowledge;
         an acquaintance with all the beautiful arts; an easy command, a precision, warmth,
         &amp; richness of expression; &amp; a judgement, that is rarely mistaken, on any subject to
         wch he applies it. of the Dialogues I have formerly told you my thoughts. the Essays
         and Letters (many of them entirely new to me) <span style="font-style:italic">on the Arts</span> are curious &amp; entertaining. those on other subjects (even where the thoughts are
         not new to me, but borrowed from his various reading &amp; conversation) often better
         put, &amp; better express'd than in the originals. I rejoice, when I see Machiavel defended
         or illustrated, who to me appears one of the wisest Men, that any nation in any age
         has produced. most of the other discourses military or political are well worth reading,
         tho' that on Kouli-Khan was a mere Jeu d'esprit, a sort of historical exercise. the
         letters from Russia I had read before with pleasure, particularly the narrative of
         Munich &amp; Lascy's campaigns. the detach'd thoughts are often new &amp; just; but there
         should have been a revisal of them, as they are often to be found in his letters repeated
         in the very same words. some too of the familiar letters might have been spared. The
         Congress of Cythera I had seen, &amp; liked before, the <span style="font-style:italic">Giudicio d'Amore</span> is an addition rather inferior to it. the verses are not equal to the prose, but
         they are above mediocrity.
      </p>
      <p>I shall be glad to hear your health is improved, &amp; that you have thoughts of favouring
         us with your company here.
