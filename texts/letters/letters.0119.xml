            <dateline>London, April, Thursday.</dateline>

         <p>You are the first who ever made a Muse of a Cough; to me it seems a much more easy task to versify in one's sleep, (that indeed you
					were of old famous for) than for want of it. Not the wakeful nightingale (when she had a cough) ever
					sung so sweetly. I give you thanks for your warble, and wish you could sing yourself to rest. These wicked remains of your illness will
					sure give way to warm weather and gentle exercise; which I hope you will not omit as the season advances. Whatever low spirits and
					indolence, the effect of them, may advise to the contrary, I pray you add five steps to your walk daily for my sake; by the help of
					which, in a month's time, I propose to set you on horseback.</p>
         <p>I talked of the Dunciad as concluding you had seen it; if you have not, do you choose I should get and send it you? I have myself,
					upon your recommendation, been reading Joseph Andrews. The incidents are ill laid and without
					invention; but the characters have a great deal of nature, which always pleases even in her lowest shapes. Parson Adams is perfectly
					well; so is Mrs. Slipslop, and the story of Wilson; and throughout he shews himself well read in Stage-Coaches, Country Squires, Inns,
					and Inns of Court. His reflections upon high people and low people, and misses and masters, are very good. However the exaltedness of
					some minds (or rather as I shrewdly suspect their insipidity and want of feeling or observation) may make them insensible to these
					light things, (I mean such as characterize and paint nature) yet surely they are as weighty and much more useful than your grave
					discourses upon the mind, the passions, and what not. Now as the paradisaical pleasures of the
					Mahometans consist in playing upon the flute and lying with Houris, be mine to read eternal new romances of Marivaux and Crebillon.
				</p>
         <p>You are very good in giving yourself the trouble to read and find fault with my long harangues. Your freedom (as you call it) has so
					little need of apologies, that I should scarce excuse your treating me any otherwise; which, whatever compliment it might be to my
					vanity, would be making a very ill one to my understanding. As to matter of stile, I have this to say: The language of the age is never
					the language of poetry; except among the French, whose verse, where the thought or image does not support it, differs in nothing from
					prose. Our poetry, on the contrary, has a language peculiar to itself; to which almost every one, that has written, has added something
					by enriching it with foreign idioms and derivatives: Nay sometimes words of their own composition or invention. Shakespear and Milton
					have been great creators this way; and no one more licentious than Pope or Dryden, who perpetually borrow expressions from the former.
					Let me give you some instances from Dryden, whom every body reckons a great master of our poetical tongue. ‚Äî Full of <hi rend="italic">museful mopeings</hi>‚Äìunlike the <hi rend="italic">trim</hi> of love‚Äìa pleasant <hi rend="italic">beverage</hi>‚Äìa <hi rend="italic">roundelay</hi> of love‚Äìstood silent in his <hi rend="italic">mood</hi>‚Äìwith
					knots and <hi rend="italic">knares</hi> deformed‚Äìhis <hi rend="italic">ireful mood</hi>‚Äìin proud <hi rend="italic">array</hi>‚Äìhis <hi rend="italic">boon</hi> was granted‚Äìand <hi rend="italic">disarray</hi> and shameful rout‚Äì<hi rend="italic">wayward</hi> but wise‚Äì<hi rend="italic">furbished</hi> for the field‚Äìthe <hi rend="italic">foiled
						dodderd</hi> oaks‚Äì<hi rend="italic">disherited‚Äìsmouldring</hi> flames‚Äì<hi rend="italic">retchless</hi> of
						laws‚Äì<hi rend="italic">crones</hi> old and ugly‚Äìthe <hi rend="italic">beldam</hi> at his side‚Äìthe <hi rend="italic">grandam-hag‚Äìvillanize</hi> his Father's fame. ‚Äî But they are infinite: And our language not being a
					settled thing (like the French) has an undoubted right to words of an hundred years old, provided antiquity have not rendered them
					unintelligible. In truth, Shakespear's language is one of his principal beauties; and he has no less advantage over your Addisons and
					Rowes in this, than in those other great excellencies you mention. Every word in him is a picture. Pray put me the following lines into
					the tongue of our modern Dramatics:</p>
         <q>
            <p>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, <lb/> Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass: <lb/> I, that am rudely stampt,
						and want love's majesty <lb/> To strut before a wanton ambling nymph: <lb/> I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, <lb/>
						Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, <lb/> Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time <lb/> Into this breathing world, scarce
						half made up‚Äì
					</p>
         </q>
         <p>And what follows. To me they appear untranslatable; and if this be the case, our language is greatly degenerated. However, the
					affectation of imitating Shakespear may doubtless be carried too far; and is no sort of excuse for sentiments ill-suited, or speeches
					ill-timed, which I believe is a little the case with me. I guess the most faulty expressions may be these‚Äì<hi rend="italic">silken</hi> son of <hi rend="italic">dalliance</hi>‚Äì<hi rend="italic">drowsier</hi> pretensions‚Äìwrinkled <hi rend="italic">beldams‚Äìarched</hi> the hearer's brow and <hi rend="italic">riveted</hi> his eyes in <hi rend="italic">fearful
						extasie.</hi> These are easily altered or omitted: and indeed if the thoughts be wrong or superfluous, there is nothing easier than to
					leave out the whole. The first ten or twelve lines are, I believe, the best; and as for the rest, I
					was betrayed into a good deal of it by Tacitus; only what he has said in five words, I imagine I have said in fifty lines: Such is the
					misfortune of imitating the inimitable. Now, if you are of my opinion, una litura may do the business better than a dozen; and you need
					not fear unravelling my web. I am a sort of spider; and have little else to do but spin it over again, or creep to come other place and
					spin there. Alas! for one who has nothing to do but amuse himself, I believe my amusements are as little amusing as most folks. But no
					matter; it makes the hours pass, and is better than <hi rend="italic">·ºêŒΩ</hi>
