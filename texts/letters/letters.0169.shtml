      <p>I perceive, that Second Parts are as bad to write, as they can be to read; for this,
         wch you ought to have had a Week after the first, has been a full Month in coming
         forth. the Spirit of Lazyness (the Spirit of the Place), begins to possess even me,
         that have so long declaimed against it: yet has it not so prevail'd, but that I feel
         that Discontent with myself, that <span style="font-style:italic">Ennuy,</span> that ever accompanies it in its Beginnings. Time will settle my Conscience, Time
         will reconcile me to this languid Companion: we shall smoke, we shall tipple, we shall
         doze together. we shall have our little Jokes, like other People, and our long Stories;
         Brandy will finish what Port begun; &amp; a Month after the Time you will see in some
         Corner of a London Even:ng Post, Yesterday, died the Revnd Mr John Grey, Senior-Fellow
         of Clare-Hall, a facetious Companion, &amp; well-respected by all that knew him. his death
         is supposed to have been occasion'd by a Fit of an Apoplexy, being found fall'n out
         of Bed with his Head in the Chamber-Pot.
      </p>
      <p>I am half ashamed to write University News to you, but as perhaps you retain some
         little Leven of Pembroke Hall, your nursing Mother, I am in hopes you will not be
         more than half-ashamed to read it. Pembroke then is all harmonious &amp; delightful since
         the Pacification: but I wish you would send them up some Boys, for they are grown
         extremely thin from their late long Indisposition. Keene's <span style="font-style:italic">Implications</span>  have ended queerly, for contrary to all Common-Sense Peter Nourse &amp; two others have
         joined Rogers, &amp; brought in a shameful low Creature by a Majority. the Master appeals
         to the Visitor against their Choice, as of a Person not qualified. he has received
         the Appeal, &amp; (I suppose) will put in Brocket (Dr Keene's Man) by main Force. Chapman
         is at present in Town in waiting; he has just married a Miss Barnwell, Niece to one
         Dr Barnwell, who was Minister of Trompington, with 2000£, a plain Woman, &amp; about his
         own Age. I hear, that when he sent to Leicester-House to know, when the Prince would
         be waited upon with the Book of Verses on the Peace the Prince appointed no Day at
         all; but order'd the Verses to be sent, &amp; left there. the Design of receiving the
         University at New-Castle House is said to be alter'd; the Duke intending to come hither,
         (I imagine) after the Parliament is risen. Rosse's Epistles of Tully ad Familiares
         will come out in about a Week. it is in two handsome 8vo Volumes with an Introd:tion
         &amp; Notes in English, but no Translation, dedicated to Ld Gower. now I am come to Books,
         there is a new Edition of Montesquieu's Work (wch I mention'd to you before) publishing
         in 2V 8vo.
      </p>
      <p>have you seen old Crebillon's Catilina, a Tragedy, wch has had a prodigious Run at
         Paris? historical Truth is too much perverted in it, wch is ridiculous in a Story
         so generally known: but if you can get over this, the Sentiments &amp; Versification are
         fine, &amp; most of the Characters (particularly the principal one) painted with great
         Spirit. observe, if you chuse to send for it, not to have Brindley's Edition, wch
         is all false Prints, but Vaillant's. there is a Work publishing in Denmark by Subscription
         (4 Guineas) Travels in Egypt by Capt: Norden. he was once in England (as Tutor to
         a young Count Daniskiold, hereditary Admiral of Denmark) &amp; known to many Persons for
         a Man of Sense, &amp; that understood Drawing extremely well: accordingly it is the Plates,
         that raise it to such a price, &amp; are said to be excellent. the Author himself is dead,
         &amp; his papers are publish'd by the Academy at Copenhagen. Mr Birch, the indefatigable,
         has just put out a thick 8vo of original Papers of Q: Elizabeth's Time. there are
         many curious Things in it, particularly Letters from Sr Rob: Cecil (Salisbury) about
         his Negotiations with Henry the 4th of France; the Earl of Monmouth's odd Account
         of Q: Elizabeth's Death, several Peculiarities of James 1st &amp; Pr: Henry, &amp;c: and above
         all an excellent Account of the State of France with Characters of the King, his Court,
         &amp; Ministry, by Sr G: Carew, Ambassador there. this, I think, is all new worth mentioning,
         that I have seen or heard of, except a natural History of Peru in Spanish, printed
         at London, by Don — something, a Man of Learning, sent thither by the Court on Purpose.
      </p>
      <p>I shall venture to accept of a Part of that kind Offer you once made me (for my Finances
         are much disorder'd this Year) by desiring you to lend me twenty Guineas. the sooner
         you can do this, the more convenient it will be to me, &amp; if you can find a Method
         to pay it here; still more so. but if any thing should happen, that may defer it,
         or make this Method troublesome: then I will desire you to make it payable in Town
         after the first Week in June, when I shall be obliged to go thither.
      </p>
      <p>I want to hear from you, to know of your Health &amp; that of your Family. my best Compliments
         to Mrs Wharton, Mr Brown comes &amp; throws in his <span style="font-style:italic">little comps</span> too, &amp; we are both very truly
      </p>
