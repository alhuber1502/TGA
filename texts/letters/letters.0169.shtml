      <p>I perceive, that Second Parts are as bad to write, as they can be to read; for this,
         wch you ought to have had a Week after the first, has been a full Month in coming
         forth. the Spirit of Lazyness (the Spirit of the Place),<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> begins to possess even me, that have so long declaimed against it: yet has it not
         so prevail'd, but that I feel that Discontent with myself, that <span style="font-style:italic">Ennuy,</span> that ever accompanies it in its Beginnings. Time will settle my Conscience, Time
         will reconcile me to this languid Companion: we shall smoke, we shall tipple, we shall
         doze together. we shall have our little Jokes, like other People, and our long Stories;
         Brandy will finish what Port begun; &amp; a Month after the Time you will see in some
         Corner of a London Even:ng Post, Yesterday, died the Revnd Mr John Grey, Senior-Fellow
         of Clare-Hall, a facetious Companion, &amp; well-respected by all that knew him.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> his death is supposed to have been occasion'd by a Fit of an Apoplexy, being found
         fall'n out of Bed with his Head in the Chamber-Pot.</p>
      <p>I am half ashamed to write University News to you, but as perhaps you retain some
         little Leven of Pembroke Hall, your nursing Mother, I am in hopes you will not be
         more than half-ashamed to read it. Pembroke then is all harmonious &amp; delightful since
         the Pacification:<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but I wish you would send them up some Boys, for they are grown extremely thin<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> from their late long Indisposition. Keene's <span style="font-style:italic">Implications</span> <sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> have ended queerly, for contrary to all Common-Sense Peter Nourse<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; two others have joined Rogers,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> &amp; brought in a shameful low Creature by a Majority. the Master appeals to the Visitor
         against their Choice, as of a Person not qualified. he has received the Appeal, &amp;
         (I suppose) will put in Brocket<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (Dr Keene's Man) by main Force. Chapman<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is at present in Town in waiting; he has just married a Miss Barnwell, Niece to one
         Dr Barnwell,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> who was Minister of Trompington, with 2000£, a plain Woman, &amp; about his own Age.
         I hear, that when he sent to Leicester-House<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> to know, when the Prince would be waited upon with the Book of Verses on the Peace<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the Prince appointed no Day at all; but order'd the Verses to be sent, &amp; left there.
         the Design of receiving the University at New-Castle House<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> is said to be alter'd; the Duke intending to come hither, (I imagine) after the Parliament
         is risen. Rosse's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Epistles of Tully ad Familiares will come out in about a Week. it is in two handsome
         8vo Volumes with an Introd:tion &amp; Notes in English,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> but no Translation, dedicated to Ld Gower.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> now I am come to Books, there is a new Edition of Montesquieu's Work (wch I mention'd
         to you before) publishing in 2V 8vo.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
      <p>have you seen old Crebillon's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Catilina, a Tragedy, wch has had a prodigious Run at Paris? historical Truth is too
         much perverted in it, wch is ridiculous in a Story so generally known: but if you
         can get over this, the Sentiments &amp; Versification are fine, &amp; most of the Characters
         (particularly the principal one) painted with great Spirit. observe, if you chuse
         to send for it, not to have Brindley's Edition, wch is all false Prints, but Vaillant's.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> there is a Work publishing in Denmark by Subscription (4 Guineas) Travels in Egypt
         by Capt: Norden.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> he was once in England (as Tutor to a young Count Daniskiold, hereditary Admiral
         of Denmark) &amp; known to many Persons for a Man of Sense, &amp; that understood Drawing
         extremely well: accordingly it is the Plates, that raise it to such a price, &amp; are
         said to be excellent. the Author himself is dead, &amp; his papers are publish'd by the
         Academy at Copenhagen. Mr Birch,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> the indefatigable, has just put out a thick 8vo of original Papers of Q: Elizabeth's
         Time. there are many curious Things in it, particularly Letters from Sr Rob: Cecil
         (Salisbury)<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> about his Negotiations with Henry the 4th of France; the Earl of Monmouth's<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> odd Account of Q: Elizabeth's Death, several Peculiarities of James 1st &amp; Pr: Henry,
         &amp;c: and above all an excellent Account of the State of France with Characters of the
         King, his Court, &amp; Ministry, by Sr G: Carew,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Ambassador there. this, I think, is all new worth mentioning, that I have seen or
         heard of, except a natural History of Peru in Spanish, printed at London,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> by Don — something, a Man of Learning, sent thither by the Court on Purpose.</p>
      <p>I shall venture to accept of a Part of that kind Offer you once made me<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> (for my Finances are much disorder'd this Year) by desiring you to lend me twenty
         Guineas. the sooner you can do this, the more convenient it will be to me, &amp; if you
         can find a Method to pay it here; still more so. but if any thing should happen, that
         may defer it, or make this Method troublesome: then I will desire you to make it payable
         in Town after the first Week in June, when I shall be obliged to go thither.</p>
      <p>I want to hear from you, to know of your Health &amp; that of your Family. my best Compliments
         to Mrs Wharton, Mr Brown comes &amp; throws in his <span style="font-style:italic">little comps</span> too, &amp; we are both very truly</p>
