      <p>I do not doubt but before this time You have made many reflections on my caprice,
         or extreme unpoliteness, in giving no sign of gratitude, or even of bare sensibility,
         to your very obliging Letter. but I shall throw part of the fault on you, for only
         consider how embarassing it is, to receive the highest applause, (&amp; that given with
         an air of sincerity) without either exposing one's own pride quite naked, or affecting
         to cover it with an aukward humility, w<span class="super">ch</span> every body has eyes to see through. in short I hope You very accurately informed
         yourself of my age, before you ventured to treat me so, for had I been some years
         younger, it might have turn'd my head. as it is, I find myself still young enough
         to tast the sweets of praise (and to like the taste too) yet old enough not to be
         intoxicated with them. to own the truth, they give me spiritis, but I begin to wonder,
         they should hurt any body's health, when we can so easily dash them with the bitter
         salutary drop of misery &amp; mortality, that we always carry about us. I well remember
         the honour You did me in expressing so kind a prejudice &amp; partiality for one as yet
         unknown to you, as to offer him your Friendship. I own it is difficult to excuse my
         silence here, &amp; therefore I will trust this part of my cause to your humanity. begin
         to exercise your Good-Will to me by bearing with that natural gloom &amp; heaviness of
         temper, that hangs about me. when we are better acquainted, I fear you will meet with
         many more essential faults to exercise your indulgence upon.
      </p>
      <p>You must indulge me too in another instance of less importance. that Ode, w<span class="super">ch</span> has been mention'd to you under the name of the <span class="hi">Powers of Poetry</span> I should very readily shew you, whenever we meet, &amp; be glad to ask your opinion of
         it: but I can convey it to you no other way than by the Post, w<span class="super">ch</span> is not to be depended upon, &amp; I have been already threaten'd with publication, tho'
         there are no more than three copies of it in the world. to abate your curiosity I
         assure you it is very incorrect, &amp; being wrote by fits &amp; starts at very distant intervals
         is so unequal that it will hardly admit of particular corrections. You may believe
         me, for I pretend to judge of myself with tolerable impartiality. you call it <span class="hi">celebrated</span>, but its celebrity is only owing to its being yet unpublish'd. I have written part
         of another, w<span class="super">ch</span> intends to be much better, but my Inspiration is very apt to fail me before I come
         to a conclusion. I desire to know your opinion of M<span class="super">r</span> Mason's four new Odes. you will see, that He is a particular Friend of mine, from
         reading them: yet I expect your judgement upon them &amp; that of your best Northern Criticks,
         if there be any Criticks there. provided You shew yourself noble &amp; forgive my long
         inactivity, I will repay your Criticism in Poetry, but it must be Latin, for I too
         wrote Latin once upon a time.
      </p>
      <p>My Compliments have now a sort of right to wait upon Lady Swinburne, whose former
         politeness I well remember'd, &amp; whose invitation I should gladly embrace if I had
         the good fortune of seeing York again. there is another Lady I dare not present my
         respects to, unless You will introduce &amp; recommend them for me.
      </p>
      <p>D<span class="super">r</span> Long (in whose College I now reside, for I have left Peter-House) desires me to make
         his Comp<span class="super">ts</span> to You.
