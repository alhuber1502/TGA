				     <p>I was yesterday told, that Turner (the Professor of Modern History here) was dead in London. if it
					be true; I conclude, it is now too late to begin asking for it: but we had (if you remember) some Conversation on that Head at
					Twickenham; &amp; as you have probably found some Opportunity to mention it to Mr W: since, I would gladly know his Thoughts about it.
					what he can do, he only can tell us: what he will do, if he can, is with me no Question. if he could find a proper Channel; I certainly
					might ask it with as much, or more Propriety, than any one in this Place. if any thing were done, it should be as private as possible;
					for if the People, who have any Sway here, could prevent it, I think they would most zealously. I am not sorry for writing you a little
					interested Letter: perhaps it is a Stratagem: the only one I had left, to provoke an Answer from you, &amp; revive our â€“
					Correspondence, shall I call it? there are many particulars relating to you, that have long interested me more than twenty Matters of
					this Sort, but you have had no Regard for my Curiosity: and yet it is something, that deserves a better Name! I don't so much as know
					your Direction, or that of Mr Whithed.</p>
