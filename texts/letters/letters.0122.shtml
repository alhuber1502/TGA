      <p>Without any preface I come to your verses,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> which I read over and over with excessive pleasure, and which are at least as good
         as Propertius. I am only sorry you follow the blunders of Broukhusius,<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> all whose insertions are nonsense. I have some objections to your antiquated words,
         and am also an enemy to Alexandrines; at least I do not like them in Elegy. I like
         your Elegy extremely, so extremely, that I long to shew you some little errors you
         are fallen into by following Broukhusius: for example, your thirty first lines are
         most intelligibly soft and pretty: but pray what sense do you affix to your six Broukhusian
         lines, that begin at happy youth and end at â€“ let me die? [...]<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> Were I with you now, and Propertius with your verses lay upon the table between us,
         I could discuss this point in a moment; but there is nothing so tiresome as spinning
         out a criticism in a letter; doubts arise, and explanations follow, till there swells
         out at least a volume of undigested observations: and all because you are not with
         him whom you want to convince. Read only the letters between Pope and Cromwell<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> in proof of this; they dispute without end. Are you aware now that I have an interest
         all this while in banishing Criticism from our correspondence? Indeed I have; for
         I am going to write down a little Ode (if it deserves the name) for your perusal,
         which I am afraid will hardly stand that test. Nevertheless I leave you at your full
         liberty; so here it follows.</p>
      <div class="q">
         <p>ODE.</p> 
         <p>Dear Gray, that always in my heart <br /> Possessest far the better part, <br /> What mean these sudden blasts that rise <br /> And drive the Zephyrs from the skies? <br /> O join with mine thy tuneful lay, <br /> And invocate the tardy May.</p> 
         <p>Come, fairest Nymph, resume thy reign! <br /> Bring all the Graces in thy train! <br /> With balmy breath, and flowery tread, <br /> Rise from thy soft ambrosial bed; <br /> Where, in elysian slumber bound, <br /> Embow'ring myrtles veil thee round.</p> 
         <p>Awake, in all thy glories drest, <br /> Recall the Zephyrs from the west; <br /> Restore the sun, revive the skies, <br /> At mine, and Nature's call, arise! <br /> Great Nature's self upbraids thy stay, <br /> And misses her accustom'd May.</p> 
         <p>See! all her works demand thy aid; <br /> The labours of Pomona fade: <br /> A plaint is heard from ev'ry tree; <br /> Each budding flow'ret calls for thee; <br /> The Birds forget to love and sing; <br /> With storms alone the forests ring.</p> 
         <p>Come then, with Pleasure at thy side, <br /> Diffuse thy vernal spirit wide; <br /> Create, where'er thou turn'st thy eye, <br /> Peace, Plenty, Love, and Harmony; <br /> Till ev'ry being share its part, <br /> And Heav'n and Earth be glad at heart.<sup style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup></p>
