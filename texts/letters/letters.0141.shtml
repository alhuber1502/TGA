      </div>
      <p>This is only to entreat you would order mes Gens to clean out the Appartments, spread
         the Carpets, air the Beds, put up the Tapestry, unpaper the Frames, &amp;c: fit to receive
         a great Potentate, that comes down in the Flying Coach drawn by Green Dragons on Friday
         the 10th Instant. as the Ways are bad, &amp; the Dragons a little out of Repair (for they
         don't actually fly; but only go, like a lame Ostrich, something between a Hop &amp; a
         Trot) it will probably be late when he lands, so he would not chuse to be known, &amp;
         desires there may be no Bells, nor Bonfires: but as Persons incog: love to be seen,
         he will slip into the Coffee House. is Mr Trollope among you? good lack! he will pull
         off my Head for never writeing to him. oh Conscience! Conscience!
