<h2 id="whatis">1. What is the <em>Thomas Gray Archive</em>?</h2>

<p>The <em>Thomas Gray Archive</em> is a collaborative digital archive
  devoted to the eighteenth-century poet, letter-writer, and scholar Thomas Gray (1716-1771). It is intended as a learning, teaching, and research tool for Gray
studies. It aims at contributing to Gray scholarship by applying good practice
in the creation and presentation of its primary texts and secondary materials.
The <em>Thomas Gray Archive</em> is 
<em>not</em> a physical archive in the sense the term is used by the
professional archiving community, it exists as an educational online resource, solely intended for teaching, research, and study (<a href="./#gen">more
information</a>).
</p>

<h2 id="special">2. What is the <em>Archive's</em> purpose?</h2>

<p>The <em>Archive</em> is committed to providing scholars, teachers, and
students of Gray's works with as large and as reliable a corpus of the
works and secondary materials as possible, drawing on the resources of
libraries, archives, and collections from around the world. It is developing an
online environment that is easy-to-use, standards-based, open access, 
and CC licensed. The <em>Archive</em> will provide users with assistance and
guidance on the use of the Website and its resources.</p>

<h2  id="director">3. Who directs the <em>Archive</em>?</h2>

<p>The <em>Thomas Gray Archive</em> was co-founded by Reimer Eck
  (Associate Director, GÃ¶ttingen State and University Library) and
  Alexander Huber (University of Oxford) who is also its editor. Please see
  the <a href="/about/#contact">contact information</a> on how to get
  in touch.</p> 

<h2  id="start">4. Where do I start?</h2>

<p>This largely depends on the kind of information you are looking for.
If you want to find out about Gray's poetry, letters, or prose works, need to
analyse a poem, or conduct research on particular topics in Gray's works, the
<a  href="/texts/"><em>Texts</em></a> section is the place to start.
It offers complete lists of titles and first lines to access the poems, a calendar of Gray's letters, including some digitised images of manuscripts, selected prose works, and a digital library of primary sources. On the other hand,
if you need background information, e.g. about Gray's life, but also about
Gray scholarship, archival resources, and related Websites, the <A
href="/resources/"><em>Resources</em></a> section is the best place to
start. It offers a finding aid to manuscripts, a concordance, a criticism section, a biographical sketch, a chronology of
Gray's life and works, a glossary of names and terms, as well as a Gray
bibliography, a picture gallery, and related links. All of these sections are
heavily cross-linked, so that there is really more than one way of discovering
the resources in the <em>Archive</em>. If all else fails, you can always <a href="/search/">search</a> the <em>Archive's</em> resources.</p>

<h2 id="research">5. Will you help me with my homework or research?</h2>

<p>We are not a research service and cannot answer specific questions or
find materials for you. Nor can we answer questions relating to homework
topics. We are, however, committed to assisting you in using the
<em>Archive</em> and finding information located in its resources. Please
consider the <a href="/resources/bib.shtml">select bibliography</a> of
print materials and the list of <a href="/resources/links.shtml">related Web
sites</a> as additional starting points for research or homework.</p>

<h2  id="estimate">6. Can you estimate the value of a Gray book I
own?</h2>

<p>Sorry, but we cannot provide this kind of service. You might try
contacting local antiquarian booksellers specializing in English
literature or an appraiser at the <a href="http://www.ilab.org/"
target="_blank" class="external">International League of Antiquarian
Booksellers</a> for an estimate of the book. You could also try to
contact a subject librarian at a research or university library if you
want to donate a rare or out-of-print book.</p>

<h2  id="cite">7. How do I cite material from the <em>Archive?</em></h2>

<p>If you want to reference the <em>Archive</em> as a source for your
work, please do include the <em>Archive's</em> full title, its editor, its
URL, and the date you accessed it. When citing the <em>Archive</em> as a
whole, please use this example (<abbr>MLA</abbr> style):</p>
