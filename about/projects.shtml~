<h3 id="201704">Gray's "Elegy" in translation</h3>
<ul class="outdent">
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 months (April 2017 - March 2018)</li>
<li><strong>Aims and Objectives:</strong> 
The aim of this project is to trace the reception and impact of Gray's
  most famous poem, the "Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard" (1751), in a
  number of languages and national literatures.  Drawing on
  the extensive collection of "Elegy" translations compiled by <a 
    target="_blank" class="external" 
    href="http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/tal.2013.0099">Tom 
    Turk</a>, the purpose of this work is firstly to enable the study
  of the evolution of translations of the poem in a single language,
  and secondly to allow for a comparative study of the translations
  across languages and literatures. 
  In the first phase of this project, we will cover the period up to
  1805, comprising more than 50 verse and prose translations of the
  "Elegy" in ten languages (Danish, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish,
  Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Welsh).  We plan to 
  extend this range to the 1830s and beyond (adding many more
  translations and languages) in future phases of the project.

<h3 id="201601">Digital edition of Thomas Gray's letters</h3>
<ul class="outdent">
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 months (January - December 2016)</li>
<li><strong>Aims and Objectives:</strong> 
The aim of this project is to make Gray's correspondence accessible online in
  a new standards-based full-text editon.  The purpose of this work is
  two-fold, firstly, it will enable us to streamline development and simplify
  any updates internally as well as to the external partners we are already
  collaborating with, and secondly, it will allow us to expand our
  outreach and facilitate new collaborations with initiatives such as
  <a href="http://correspsearch.bbaw.de/" class="external"
     target="_blank">correspSearch</a>.
The new edition will
  include improvements to the letter records, such as consistent recording of
  postmarks, locations of letter-writers and addressees, and updated information on
  people, locations, and events mentioned. 
The full-text of the edition will be based on TEI/XML and will make
  use of the new <a class="external" target="_blank"
   href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD44CD">guidelines
   for encoding correspondences</a>.  Once completed, the current
  DALF/XML-based records will be retired.
</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The project, as outlined above, was successfully
  completed on time. The TEI/XML-encoded full-text versions of the letters
  have replaced the DALF/XML-based versions.  The correspondence calendar has
  been shared with the <a href="http://correspsearch.bbaw.de/"
  class="external" target="_blank">correspSearch</a> project and Gray's
  letters are now discoverable in the correspSearch catalogue of scholarly
  editions of letters.

//-->
<ul class="outdent">
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 18 months (July 2013 - December 2014)</li>
<li><strong>Aims and Objectives:</strong> The aim of this project is to 
  augment the process and enhance the experience of close reading
  Gray's <a href="/texts/poems.shtml">English poems</a> by applying a mix of
  traditional literary and computational methods. Poems are complex rhythmic, 
  sonic, and visual entities, and we will be paying particular attention to 
  the tensions between metre and rhythm, verse line and syntactic/semantic 
  organization, and sonic clusters and breaking points, always keeping in mind
  their particular functions in the text.  Our methodology employs a set of 
  digital techniques mainly from natural language processing (tokenization, 
  normalization, lemmatization, morphosyntactic annotation, 
  sentiment analysis etc.), phonetics (phonemic transcriptions according to the
  IPA), and data visualization.
 </li>
 <li><strong>Results:</strong>  The project was successfully completed on time.
   The project results are accessible via the new "Analysis"-tab on the English
   poems' pages.  All tasks originally outlined in the project description have
   been addressed: 
  <ul style="text-indent:0em; margin-left:-.3em">
    <li>prosody and poetic form (manually): we have completed the prosodic
  analysis and classification of poetic form of Gray's English poems
  (metre, rhyme scheme, syllable pattern, and line, stanza, and poem forms).
    <li>rhythm and poetic foregrounding (computationally): we have applied a
  number of NLP tasks as a pre-requesite for a more thorough, computationally
  facilitated analysis of the poems. We have identified and analysed a number
  of metrical irregularities and deviations computationally drawing on the
  identified syllabic and metrical stress patterns.
    <li>tropes and figures (computationally): we have successfully detected
  a number of rhetorical figures in several linguistic domains. These
  include: alliteration, paroemion, assonance, consonance (phonological);
  polyptoton, epizeuxis, diacope, anaphora, epistrophe (morphological);
  simile, homophonic paronomasia (semantic); ecphonesis, apostrophe
  (pragmatic).
    <li>sonic patterns, clusters, and breaking points (computationally):
  we have identified and investigated sonic phenomena only in the context of
  the detection of phonological figures, and not, as initially suggested, in
  relation to imagery and changes in sentiment.
    <li>data visualization (computationally): we have collaborated with the 
  <a class="external" target="_blank" href="http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford
   e-Research Centre</a> to include Gray's English poems in
   their <a class="external" target="_blank" 
href="http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/projects/imagery-lenses-visualizing-text-corpora"><em>Poem Viewer</em></a>
   visualization service.  The poems have been uploaded to the tool and are
   now permanently accessible from the <em>Poem
   Viewer</em> <a class="external"

<ul class="outdent">
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 5 months (June - October 2012)</li>
<li><strong>Aims and Objectives:</strong> The aim of this project is to
  integrate the <em>Archive's</em> correspondence calendar into the 
  <a class="external" target="_blank"
  href="http://www.e-enlightenment.com/"><em>Electronic Enlightenment
  Project</em></a>. This initiative is part of a plan to foster closer 
  collaboration between the <em>Archive</em> and the <em>Electronic
  Enlightenment Project</em> through the sharing and of relevant resources
  and the exchange of technical and editorial expertise.
</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The project was successfully completed on time.
  The <em>Archive's</em> correspondence calendar was shared 
  with the <em>Electronic Enlightenment Project</em> to supplement the 650
  Gray letters with holdings information and print and online bibliographies.

<h3 id="201203">Archive Website Re-design</h3>
<ul class="outdent">
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months (March - August 2012)</li>
<li><strong>Aims and Objectives:</strong> The aim of this project is to 
  re-design the <em>Archive</em> Website functionally and visually.  The
  purpose of the re-design is two-fold: firstly, to future-proof the Website
  by moving it to current and emerging Web standards such as HTML5, 
  CSS3, and JavaScript/jQuery, and secondly, to speed up the development and
  integration of new tools and functionalities.  The visual re-design aims to
  provide a new more modern layout, user-friendly design, and improved
  navigation and access to content.  We will also conduct a basic type of
  usability testing in the form of an expert review.
</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The project was successfully completed on time. 
  The newly designed Website replaced a design last updated substantially in
  2006.
  The main areas of improvements include:
    prominent placement of navigation aids;
    redesigned layout for increased readability;
    intuitive and responsive digital library interface;
    simplified access to notes and queries;
    full-text of letters prominently displayed;
    cross-referencing between primary and secondary content.
  There is also a revised About section that comprises aims and objectives,
  history, funding, methodology, output and dissemination, copyright and
  citation guide, use and privacy policy, acknowledgements, and contact
  information.

<h3 id="201109">Digitization of Oxford University's Gray MSS holdings</h3>
<ul class="outdent">
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 months (September - November 2011)</li>
<li><strong>Aims and Objectives:</strong> The aim of this project is to
  digitize and make freely accessible Oxford University's Gray MSS holdings.  
  The project was made possible by an agreement with the Bodleian Libraries
  to this effect obtained in June 2011.  The digitization of the MSS will be
  done by the Bodleian's <a 
  href="http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley/using-this-library/imaging_services"
  class="external" target="_blank">Imaging Services</a> unit on one of their
  Grazer cradle scanning stations.  The material will be digitized in two
  batches (literary MSS and correspondence materials) over a three months
  period.  The project will also allow us to catalogue the MSS in the process.
</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The project was successfully completed on time.
  High quality digital images of the <a 
  href="/cgi-bin/findaid.cgi?ead=grayt.ead.0001&amp;collection=poems&amp;holding=BDLN">eight 
  literary Gray MSS</a> held by the Bodleian Libraries were added in the
  December update.
  The <a href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?collection=letters&amp;holding=BDLN">four 
  Gray MS letters</a> will be added to the <em>Archive's</em> digital library
  in March.  The MSS records in the finding aid and letters collection have
  been updated.

<h3 id="200512">An integrated finding aid to Thomas Gray manuscripts</h3>
<ul class="outdent">
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 months (December 2005 - November 2006)</li>
<li><strong>Aims and Objectives:</strong> The aim of this project is to
  create an integrated finding aid to Thomas Gray manuscripts, initially
  focusing on poetry MSS.  The finding aid will contain information about all 
  identified autograph poetry manuscripts as well as transcripts in the
  hands of Gray's contemporaries and early editors of his works.  We will
  adopt the XML-based <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/" class="external"
  target="_blank">EAD 2002</a> standard for recording collection-level
  descriptions and archival information, including a physical description of
  the items wherever possible. Where available, the records will contain links
  to digital surrogates of both the original manuscripts and the first printed
  edition of the work.  Following the example in contemporary indices and
  location registers of MSS, the finding aid will be arranged alphabetically
  by uniform titles of works, as found in the Primary Texts section of the
  <em>Thomas Gray Archive</em>. The individual manuscript witnesses will be listed
  chronologically.
</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The project was successfully completed on
  time.  The <a href="/resources/findaid.shtml">finding aid</a> lists 213 MSS
  items for 66 poetical works.  We have been able to record and verify
  location information for the vast majority of MSS.  All identified MSS held
  at Oxford and at the British Library have been catalogued at the holding
  institutions.  The workflows and procedures are now in place to extend the
  work to all known Thomas Gray manuscripts, including his prose
  works, personal papers, and marginalia.

<h3 id="200304">A browsable calendar to the correspondence of Thomas Gray</h3>
<ul class="outdent">
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 months (April - December 2003)</li>
<li><strong>Aims and Objectives:</strong> The aim of this project is to
  create an up-to-date digital calendar of Gray's complete correspondence.  
  To this purpose, we are adopting a new XML-based standard for correspondence
  materials, developed by Edward Vanhoutte and Ron Van den Branden, named
  <a href="http://ctb.kantl.be/project/dalf/" class="external" target="_blank">DALF</a>.  
  One of the key objectives of the project is to verify and record the
  current location of all surviving pieces of correspondence.  A secondary
  objective is to obtain, wherever possible, digital surrogates of the
  original letters and permission to make them freely accessible online.  To
  this end we will be collaborating with reference and special collections
  librarians at every identified holding institution.  It is expected that
  the initial project period of 9 months will allow us to produce a complete
  set of basic bibliographic records, which will be enhanced over time.
</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The project was successfully completed on time.
  The <a href="/texts/letters.shtml">correspondence calendar</a> lists details
  for 646 letters written by or to Gray.  In the process, we have been able to
  verify the location of more than 80% of the surviving letters.  We have also
  obtained permission to put online a number of digital surrogates that have
  been made available to us.
