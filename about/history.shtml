<li>Our <em>Gray's "Elegy" in translation</em>-project (phase I:
  1751-1805) is taking shape: 58 translations (46 of which in verse)
  in eleven languages (Danish, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, 
  Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Welsh) all marked up in
  TEI/XML.  Between now and April we will be concentrating on the user
  interface, including dynamic side-by-side display, an annotation,
  editing, and translation tool, and the integration of external
  services supporting comparative analysis. Please take a look at our
  updated <a href="http://www.thomasgray.org/about/projects.shtml#201704">project

<li></a><em>Thomas Gray Archive: Spring 2017 update</em>
<ul>
<li>
We are delighted to announce the start of a new 12-month project at the
<em>Thomas Gray Archive</em>: <a
href="/about/projects.shtml#201704">Gray's "Elegy" in translation</a>. The aim
of this project is to trace the reception and impact of Gray's most famous
poem, the "Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard" (1751), in a number of
languages and national literatures.
</li>
<li>
We have simplified the way notes and queries can be added to the poems in the
<em>Thomas Gray Archive</em>.  You can add notes or queries to any part of the
poetic text by simply clicking on the line in question and filling in the
annotations form with your details.  All contributions will continue to be
submitted to the editor in the first instance for review.
</li>
<li>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Looking back: </em> This year marks the 15th anniversary of the
<em>Thomas Gray Archive</em>, which was launched after a nine months project
phase on 15 November 2000.  <a href="/about/projects.shtml">Six completed
projects</a> and almost <a href="/about/history.shtml">60 quarterly updates</a>
later, the <em>Archive's</em> mission to facilitate and support the study,
research, and teaching of Gray's life and works remains central to our work.
We would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank colleagues
here at Oxford and elsewhere and our many visitors worldwide for their
continuing support and contributions.
</li>
<li>
<em>Looking ahead: </em> 2016 will mark the 300th birthday of the poet Thomas
Gray, who was born on 26 December 1716.  There have already been notable
successes in the run-up to the 2016 tercentenary: the <a
href="http://thomasgray2016.org/">Stoke Poges Society</a> has successfully
secured funding to restore Gray's tomb and monument in Stoke Poges and is
running an annual poetry competition to celebrate Gray's lasting legacy.
Events, celebrations, and exhibitions are also planned in Cambridge and
London.  At the <em>Archive</em> we are preparing a project that aims to
enhance access to Gray's Nachlass.

is to make the <em>Archive's</em> calendar of Gray's correspondence
discoverable and usable in the project's <a

</li><li>
One third of the way through our <a
href="/about/projects.shtml#201307"><em>Close reading Gray, digitally</em></a>
project, we have already completed a number of important tasks, including the
prosodic analysis and classification of poetic form of Gray's English poems,
the application of several NLP tasks, and the phonetic transcription of the
poems. These are essential steps towards a computationally facilitated
analysis of rhythm and poetic foregrounding, tropes and figures, sonic
patterns, clusters, and breaking points, and various visualization options for
our findings.
