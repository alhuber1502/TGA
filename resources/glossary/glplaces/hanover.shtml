Hanover, situated on the Leine river in northern Germany, is the capital of
the state of Lower Saxony. It became an Electorate in 1692 and through the
marriage of Elector Ernst August to Princess Sophie of the Palatinate,
the House of Hanover claimed the British throne. Their son ascended to the
throne as George I, King of Great Britain and Ireland in 1714. Hanover's
&quot;personal union&quot; with Great Britain ended in 1837. <a
