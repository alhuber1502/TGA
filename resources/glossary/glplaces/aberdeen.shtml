Located on a bay of the North Sea, between the mouths of the rivers Don
and Dee on the northeastern coast of Scotland, Aberdeen was home to
two universities in the 18th century: King's College, founded in 1495
by Bishop William Elphinstone, and Marischal College, founded in 1593
by the 4th Earl Marischal on the site of the Franciscan Friary. Although <a

on an extensive tour in the Scottish Highlands with Lord Strathmore
between August and October of <a href="/resources/table.shtml#1765">1765</a>, he failed to visit
Aberdeen. However, he <a href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?collection=letters&amp;correspondence=true&amp;author=Gray%2C+Thomas%2C+1716-1771&amp;addressee=Beattie%2C+James%2C+1735-1803">corresponded with</a> and invited <a

Lord Strathmore's residence.
Gray refused an offer by Marischal College to receive a doctor of
laws degree on the ground that he had not taken it at Cambridge University.
