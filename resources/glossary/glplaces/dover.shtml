The closest point of proximity between England and continental Europe,
just 21 miles from the French port of Calais, Dover was an important
channel port and point of departure for <a
href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Gray%2C%20Thomas%2C%201716-1771">Gray</a> and <a
href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Walpole%2C%20Horace%2C%201717-1797">Walpole</a>
when they set out for the Grand Tour on 29 March <a
href="/resources/table.shtml#1739">1739</a>. On his arrival back in England about
1 September <a href="/resources/table.shtml#1741">1741</a>, Gray wrote a <a
href="/texts/letters/tgal0113">letter</a>
from there to <a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Chute%2C%20John%2C%201701-1776">John
Chute</a> whom Gray and Walpole had met at <a
href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Florence%20%28Firenze%20province%2C%20Tuscany%2C%20Italy%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7000457%5D">Florence</a>
in <a href="/resources/table.shtml#1740">1740</a>, and with whom Gray spent
two months at Venice after he had parted from Walpole at Reggio. Later, in the
Spring of <a href="/resources/table.shtml#1766">1766</a>, Gray travelled
through Kent, revisiting Dover and relating his impressions in letters
to friends.
