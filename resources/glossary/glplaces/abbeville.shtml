Situated on the river Somme, c. 60 miles south of Calais (in the
far north of France), Abbeville became an important and increasingly
wealthy town in the 18th century due to its famous Van Robais Royal
Manufacture of luxury fabrics. <a
href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Gray%2C%20Thomas%2C%201716-1771">Gray</a>
visited Abbeville,
having travelled south from Calais, on 31st March <a
href="/resources/table.shtml#1739">1739</a> N.S. while on the Grand Tour with
<a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Walpole%2C%20Horace%2C%201717-1797">Horace
Walpole</a>. He described his impressions of the town and visits to
two convents in a <a
href="/texts/letters/tgal0066">letter</a> to his <a
href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Gray%2C%20Mrs.%20%28Dorothy%29%2C%201685-1753">mother</a> sent from <a
href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Amiens%20%28Somme%2C%20Picardy%2C%20France%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7010588%5D">Amiens</a>
on the following day. Much later, in March <a
href="/resources/table.shtml#1770">1770</a>, Gray's friend <a
href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Bonstetten%2C%20Charles%20Victor%20de%2C%201745-1832">De
Bonstetten</a> wrote a <a
href="/texts/letters/tgal0578">letter</a> to Gray from
Abbeville on his way home to Switzerland. In June <a
href="/resources/table.shtml#1771">1771</a>, finally, Gray's friend <a
href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Nicholls%2C%20Norton%2C%20c.%201742-1809">Norton
Nicholls</a> <a href="/texts/letters/tgal0640">wrote</a> to
Gray from <a
href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Paris%20%28Ville%20de%20Paris%20department%2C%20Ile-de-France%2C%20France%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7008038%5D">Paris</a>
relating his impressions of Abbeville. He was on his way to visit
De Bonstetten in Switzerland, a journey Gray had contemplated taking
with Nicholls, but was then no longer equal to the exertion.
