Situated on the river Seine, in northern France, Paris was the cultural and
political centre of France. <a
href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Gray%2C%20Thomas%2C%201716-1771">Gray</a>
visited Paris, having travelled there from <a
href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Amiens%20%28Somme%2C%20Picardy%2C%20France%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7010588%5D">Amiens</a>,
from April to June <a
href="/resources/table.shtml#1739">1739</a> while on the Grand Tour with
<a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Walpole%2C%20Horace%2C%201717-1797">Horace
Walpole</a>. Walpole's connections opened the doors to fashionable
society for the two, and they indulged in sightseeing and the
amusements of the Parisian night-life. Gray described his impressions
and adventures among Parisian society in several letters to his
friends <a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#West%2C%20Richard%2C%201716-1742">West</a> and
<a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Ashton%2C%20Thomas%2C%201715-1775">Ashton</a>.
Much later, in <a
href="/resources/table.shtml#1770">1770</a>, Gray's friend <a
href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Bonstetten%2C%20Charles%20Victor%20de%2C%201745-1832">De
Bonstetten</a> wrote several letters to Gray from
Paris on his way home to Switzerland. In June <a
href="/resources/table.shtml#1771">1771</a>, finally, Gray's friend <a
href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Nicholls%2C%20Norton%2C%20c.%201742-1809">Norton
Nicholls</a> <a href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0640">wrote</a> to
Gray from <a
href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Paris%20%28Ville%20de%20Paris%20department%2C%20Ile-de-France%2C%20France%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7008038%5D">Paris</a>.
He was on his way to visit De Bonstetten in Switzerland, a journey
Gray had contemplated taking with Nicholls, but was then no longer
equal to the exertion.
