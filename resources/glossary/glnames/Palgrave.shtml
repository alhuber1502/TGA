								"William Palgrave came of a Norfolk family, many of whom had been at
								<a href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Cambridge%20%28Cambridgeshire%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7010874%5D">Cambridge</a>. His father, William Palgrave (d. 1742), had been a Fellow of
								Caius and practised as a physician at Ipswich. The son, who had been at
								Bury School, was admitted to Pembroke (aged 18) in July 1753, and
								commenced residence on 2 Nov. in that year. He was elected Scholar, and
								continued in partial residence until 1760. In 1757 he became a
								Fellow-commoner, he was admitted Bachelor of Laws in 1759, and in Nov.
								1764 he was elected Lany Fellow, and held this Bye-Fellowship until his
								death in 1799. He was ordained Deacon at Norwich in June 1759 and Priest
								soon after, and became Rector of Thrandeston, Suffolk; seven years later
								he became Rector also of Palgrave in Suffolk, both of which livings he
								held until he died.</p>
								<p>
								As a Fellow-commoner he was brought into companionship with <a
								href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Gray%2C%20Thomas%2C%201716-1771">Gray</a> and they became intimate friends.
								Gray refers to him familiarly as 'Pa' or 'old Pa' (Letters 279 [<a
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0322">letters.0322</a>], 345 [<a href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0396">letters.0396</a>] &amp;c.), a nickname explained (see Tovey, vol. ii, <a
								href="/cgi-bin/view.cgi?collection=primary&amp;sequence=ToD_1900ii:54">p.
								54</a>) by the fact that Gray pronounced his name <em>Pa</em>grave:
								another nickname given to him was 'Proud Palgrave' (Letters 461 [<A
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0517">letters.0517</a>], 484 [<a href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0541">letters.0541</a>]), and another, 'The Abb&eacute;' (Letter 414 [<a
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0468">letters.0468</a>]). He was also a friend of <a
								href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Mason%2C%20William%2C%201724-1797">Mason</a>, but seems to have treated
								Mason's poetry with flippancy. Gray wrote on the publication of
								<em>Caractacus</em>: 'Old Pa is outrageous about it' (Letter 294 [<A
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0339">letters.0339</a>]). Mitford,
								<em>Gray-Mason Correspondence</em>, <a href="/cgi-bin/view.cgi?collection=primary&amp;edition=MiJ_1853&amp;page=158">p. 158 n.</a>, gives
								an account derived from the Rev. William Alderson, 'the last survivor of
								those who personally remembered Mr. Palgrave'. He described him as 'a
								person of small stature, neat in his appearance, agreeable and clever in
								conversation, and a very pleasant companion'.</p>
								<p>
								Gray urged him to write notes on his travels (Letters 278 [<A
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0321">letters.0321</a>], 400 [<a href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0453">letters.0453</a>]), and he sent Gray his note-books. He was a virtuoso,
								and shared the tastes of
								his particular friend William Weddell, of Newby Hall, Yorks. (see Letter
								400, n. 13), who entered St. John's at the same time that Palgrave began
								residence at Pembroke. With Weddell, in 1765, he travelled in France and
								Italy (see Letter 400). Lord Sheffield, in a note to Gibbon's
								<em>Memoirs</em> (ed. Birkbeck Hill, p. 169, n. 2), records that Palgrave
								and Weddell were
								members of the Roman Club, which Gibbon describes as 'a weekly convivial
								meeting established by myself and travellers'."</p>
