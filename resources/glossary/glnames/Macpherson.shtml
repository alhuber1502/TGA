								"MACPHERSON, James (1736-96), born near Kingussie, the son of a

								and Edinburgh Universities. In 1758 he
								published <em>The Highlander</em>, a heroic poem in 6 cantos. In 1759 he
								met John Home, for whom he produced his first 'Ossianic' fragment 'The
								Death of Oscar'; encouraged by Home and Hugh Blair he then produced
								<em>Fragments of Ancient Poetry, Collected in the Highlands of Scotland,
								and Translated from the Galic or Erse Language</em> (1760).
								Interest in Primitivism was at this period considerable, and rumours that
								a Gaelic epic existed aroused much curiosity and enthusiasm; pressed on
								by his admirers, Macpherson travelled round Scotland collecting the
								materials for <em>Fingal, an Ancient Epic Poem, in Six Books</em>, which
								appeared in 1762. It purported to be Macpherson's faithful translation of
								an epic by Ossian, the son of Finn (or, in this version, Fingal), dating
								from some vague but remote period of early Scottish history. [...]
								Macpherson's other works include a prose translation of the <em>Iliad</em>
								(1773) and a <em>History of Great Britain</em> (1775). He wrote in defence
								of Lord North's ministry, was MP for Camelford from 1780, and was buried
								in Westminster Abbey at his own expense."</p>
