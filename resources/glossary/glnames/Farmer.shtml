								"Richard Farmer (1735-97), B.A. 1757; M.A. 1760; D.D. 1775; Fellow and
								Tutor of Emmanuel College, of which he subsequently became Master (1775),
								author of an <em>Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare</em> (his only
								published work). He was a friend and correspondent of <a
								href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Percy%2C%20Thomas%2C%201729-1811">Thomas Percy</a>, who
								in the Preface to his <em>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</em> (1765)
								paid a tribute to Farmer's 'extensive knowledge of ancient English
								Literature' (see Letter 340 [<a
								href="/texts/letters/tgal0391">letters.0391</a>], n. 3).</p>
								<p>
								<a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Cole%2C%20William%2C%201714-1782">Cole</a>, in his note of 31 Oct. 1780
								mentioned above, adds the following account of the relations between
								<a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Gray%2C%20Thomas%2C%201716-1771">Gray</a>
								and Farmer: 'it must have been about the Year 1770; as the first Time they
								ever met to be acquainted together, was about that Time, I met them at
								M<sup>r</sup>
								Oldham's Chambers in Peter House to Dinner. Before, they had been shy of
								each other: and tho' M<sup>r</sup> Farmer was then esteemed one of the
								most ingenious men in the University, yet M<sup>r</sup> Gray's singular
								Niceness in the Choice of his Acquaintance made him appear fastidious to
								a great Degree to all who was not acquainted with his Manner. Indeed there
								did not seem to be any Probability of any great Intimacy, from the Style
								&amp; Manner of each of them: the one a chearful, companionable, hearty,
								open, downright Man, of no great Regard to Dress or common Forms of
								Behaviour: the other, of a most fastidious &amp; recluse Distance of
								Carriage, rather averse to all Sociability, but of the graver Turn: nice
								&amp; elegant in his Person, Dress &amp; Behaviour, even to a Degree of
								Finicalness &amp; Effeminacy. So that Nothing but their extensive Learning
								&amp; Abilities could ever have coalesced two such different Men: &amp;
								both of great Value in their own Line &amp; Walk. They were ever after
								great Friends, &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Farmer &amp; all of his Acquaintance
								had soon after too much Reason to lament his Loss, &amp; the Shortness of
								their Acquaintance.'</p>
								<p>
								Cole's statement that it must have been about the Year 1770 that
								D<sup>r</sup>
								Farmer and M<sup>r</sup> Gray ever met to be acquainted together needs
								examination.
								It would have been scarcely possible for Gray and Farmer to have lived for
								so many years in
								<a href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Cambridge%20%28Cambridgeshire%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7010874%5D">Cambridge</a> without being known to one another, and in
								Percy's letters to Farmer there are references which can only be
								explained on the assumption that Farmer could consult Gray about
								questions raised by Percy and ask for his help (see Appendix N). It seems
								reasonable to conclude that Cole's meaning is that, while Gray and Farmer
								had known each other before, it was not until they dined together at Mr.
								Oldham's chambers that they became on friendly terms."</p>
