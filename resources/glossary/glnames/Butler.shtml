								consisting of 'above nine pages, all about the <a

								Jan. 1758 (Letter 264 [<A

								href="/texts/letters/tgal0308">letters.0308</a>]) received a second letter from him, containing a lengthy
								criticism of the <em><a href="/texts/poems/pppo">Progress of
								Poesy</a></em> (Letter 265* [<A
								href="/texts/letters/tgal0306">letters.0306</a>]). In this same letter he furnished Gray, who had guessed him
								to be 'some <em>reading</em> clergyman', with a few personal details about
								himself, which Gray retailed to Mason: 'He is, he says, of the number of
								those, who live less contented than they ought, in an independent
								indolence, can just afford himself a horse for airings about
								Harewood-Forest ... half-a-score new books in a season, and good part of
								half an acre of garden-ground for honeysuckles and roses.'"</p>
