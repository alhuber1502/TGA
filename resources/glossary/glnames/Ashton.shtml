								"Thomas Ashton, who is almost certainly to be identified with 'Almanzor'
								of the 'Quadruple Alliance' (see Letter 2 [<a
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0002">letters.0002</a>],
								n. 8) - the 'long, ungainly mortal of King's' of <a
								href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Gray%2C%20Thomas%2C%201716-1771">Gray's</a> letter to
								<a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Walpole%2C%20Horace%2C%201717-1797">Walpole</a> of 27 Jan. 1735 (Letter
								12 [<a href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0013">letters.0013</a>]) - was the son of a school-master at
								<a href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Lancaster%20%28Lancashire%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7010393%5D">Lancaster</a>. He was born in
								1716, the same year as Gray and <a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#West%2C%20Richard%2C%201716-1742">West</a>,
								and entered Eton about the same
								time, but was apparently somewhat their senior. From Eton he was elected
								to King's College,
								<a href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Cambridge%20%28Cambridgeshire%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7010874%5D">Cambridge</a>, in 1733, and was admitted Scholar in 1734.
								In 1737, through the good offices of Walpole, he was appointed tutor to
								the youthful Earl of Plymouth. In 1738 he was elected to a Fellowship at
								King's, and having been ordained in 1740, he was in 1742, again by
								Walpole's influence, nominated to the Crown living of Aldingham, in
								Lancashire. In 1745 he was elected Fellow of Eton, which also, according
								to <a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Cole%2C%20William%2C%201714-1782">Cole</a>, he owed to Walpole. In
								1749 he was presented to the rectory of
								Sturminster Marshall, in Dorsetshire, which in 1752 he exchanged for that
								of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate. In 1759 he took the degree of D.D. at
								Cambridge, and in 1760 married a Miss Amyand. In 1761 he was elected to
								the preachership at Lincoln's Inn, which he held for two years. He died
								at <a href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Bath%20%28Bath%20and%20Northeast%20Somerset%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7011197%5D">Bath</a> in 1775. His portrait by Eckhardt hung in Walpole's bed-chamber
								at
								<a href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Strawberry%20Hill%20%28Richmond%20upon%20Thames%2C%20Greater%20London%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom%29%2C%20neighborhood%20%5B4010855%5D">Strawberry Hill</a>, and he was also painted by Reynolds and Gainsborough.
