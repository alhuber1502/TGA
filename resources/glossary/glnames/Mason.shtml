								"William Mason (1724-97) (see Genealogical Table), the friend, literary
								executor, and biographer of <a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Gray%2C%20Thomas%2C%201716-1771">Gray</a>,
								whose acquaintance he had made in the previous year (1747), and by whom he
								was familiarly called 'Scroddles'. He had been admitted to St. John's
								College,
								<a href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Cambridge%20%28Cambridgeshire%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7010874%5D">Cambridge</a>, in 1742, and graduated B.A. in 1745-6. In 1747,
								largely through the recommendation of Gray, he was nominated to a
								Fellowship in Pembroke College, but the Master prevented his election till
								March 1749. He was ordained Deacon 17 Nov., and Priest 24 Nov. 1754,
								and three days later was instituted Rector of
								<a href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Aston%20%28Rotherham%2C%20South%20Yorkshire%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7029839%5D">Aston</a>, Yorkshire, on the
								presentation of the Earl of Holdernesse, a distant connexion (see Letter
								181 [<a href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0210">letters.0210</a>], n. 3), who appointed him domestic Chaplain, and whose private
								secretary he appears to have been for a time at the beginning of that year
								(see Letter 184 [<a href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0213">letters.0213</a>], n. 4). He was subsequently Chaplain to the King,
								1757-60, 1761-72; Canon Residentiary and Precentor of
								<a href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#York%20%28York%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7011995%5D">York</a>, 1762. He
								became acquainted with <a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Walpole%2C%20Horace%2C%201717-1797">Horace
								Walpole</a> in 1754 (see Letter 188 [<a
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0218">letters.0218</a>]
								<em>ad fin.</em>), or perhaps earlier (see Letter 159 [<A
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0180">letters.0180</a>]), and was on terms of intimacy with him until 1784, when a political
								difference put an end to their friendship for some years. Mason was the
								author of a number of plays, satires, and poems, many of which underwent
								a minute revision at the hands of Gray before publication. His
								<em>Musaeus</em>, a monody to the memory of Pope, written in 1744, had
								been published in the
								previous year (1747). At the beginning of <a
								href="/cgi-bin/view.cgi?collection=primary&amp;sequence=1775:1:172">Section
								IV</a> of his <em>Memoirs</em> Mason writes: 'It was not till about the
								year 1747 that I had the happiness of
								being introduced to the acquaintance of Mr. Gray. Some very juvenile
								imitations of Milton's juvenile poems, which I had written a year or two
								before, and of which the Monody on Mr. Pope's death was the principal, he
								then, at the request of one of my friends, was so obliging as to revise.
								The same year, on account of a dispute which had happened between the
								master and fellows of Pembroke Hall, I had the honour of being nominated
								by the Fellows to fill one of the vacant Fellowships. I was at this time
								scholar of St. John's College, and Batchelor of Arts, personally unknown
								to the gentlemen who favoured me so highly; therefore that they gave me
								this mark of distinction and preference was greatly owing to Mr. Gray,
								who was well acquainted with several of that society, and to Dr. Heberden,
								whose known partiality to every, even the smallest degree of merit, led
								him warmly to second his recommendation.'"</p>
