								"Edward Bedingfield (or Bedingfeld, as the name is now spelt) was the
								youngest son of Sir Henry Arundell Bedingfield, third Baronet of Oxburgh,
								Norfolk, and of Lady Elizabeth Boyle, eldest daughter of Charles Boyle,
								second Earl of Burlington; he was born at Oxburgh 2 Feb. 1730, and
								married, 21 March 1754, Mary Swinburne (born at Capheaton 13 May 1729),
								third daughter of Sir John Swinburne, third Baronet of Capheaton,
								Northumberland, and of Mary Bedingfield, only daughter of Edward
								Bedingfield, youngest son of the first Baronet (see Letter 183 [<a
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0212">letters.0212</a>], n. 6); he
								had ten children, of whom the second son, Thomas (1760-89), a conveyancer,
								was the author of poems, which were published after his death. (See
								Genealogical Table.) Edward Bedingfield himself had a poetical gift, one
								of his poems, written in March 1753, being 'On receiving from the
								Countess of Burlington M<sup>r</sup> Gray's Poems with Designs by
								M<sup>r</sup> Bentley'. (From

								From a series of 18 letters written by <a

								to Edward Bedingfield between
								29 Sept. 1769 and 19 July 1775, now in the Henry E. Huntington Library,
								it appears that Mason was largely indebted to Bedingfield not only for
								correcting the proofs of his own poems and of his <em><a
								href="/cgi-bin/view.cgi?collection=primary&amp;edition=1775">Memoirs
								of the Life and Writings of Mr. Gray</a>,</em> but also for the revision
								of the latter, and for not a few of the notes."</p>
