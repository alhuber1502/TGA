								"Richard West, known from his name as 'Favonius' or 'Zephyrus' in the
								'Quadruple Alliance' (see Letter 2 [<a
								href="/texts/letters/tgal0002">letters.0002</a>],
								n. 8), of which he was the only member to go to
								<a href="/resources/glplaces.shtml#Oxford%20%28Oxfordshire%2C%20England%2C%20United%20Kingdom%29%2C%20inhabited%20place%20%5B7011931%5D">Oxford</a>, was the only
								son of Richard West, an eminent lawyer, who became Lord Chancellor of
								Ireland; on his mother's side he was a grandson of Bishop Burnet. He was
								born in 1716, and went to Eton probably in 1726, the year of his father's
								death. He was a delicate youth; <a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Cole%2C%20William%2C%201714-1782">Cole</a>,
								who had been intimate with him at Eton, describes him as 'tall and slim,
								of a pale and meagre look and
								complexion, and promised not half what he performed'. He went from Eton to
								Christ Church, Oxford, as a Commoner, in May 1735, and came away, after a
								residence of three years, without taking a degree. He had early been
								destined for his father's profession of the bar, and to this end had been
								admitted at the Inner Temple in 1733. On leaving Oxford in 1738 he
								settled in the Temple, where it was intended that <a
								href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Gray%2C%20Thomas%2C%201716-1771">Gray</a> should join
								him; but this arrangement was upset by Gray's continental tour with
								<a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Walpole%2C%20Horace%2C%201717-1797">Walpole</a>. West, however, had no
								ambition 'to sit upon a bench', as he wrote to Gray in June 1740 (see
								Letter 89 [<a href="/texts/letters/tgal0101">letters.0101</a>]), and before the return of the
								latter he had left the Temple, and turned his thoughts to the army.
								Meanwhile the state of his health was becoming rapidly worse. Gray found
								him weak and dispirited, and before long, in the spring of 1742, he began
								to complain of a racking cough, which sapped his strength and robbed him
								of his sleep (see Letter 102 [<a
								href="/texts/letters/tgal0118">letters.0118</a>]). He died shortly after (1 June 1742) in a country house near Hatfield,
								so suddenly that both Gray (see Letter no 110* [<A
								href="/texts/letters/tgal0128">letters.0128</a>]) and Ashton (see 
								<em>Gray-Walpole Correspondence</em>, <a href="/texts/diglib/primary/TyP_1915ii/1/47">no. 152</a>) addressed letters to him
								after he had been dead some days. Gray gave
								expression to his own grief in the well-known sonnet <em><A
								href="/texts/poems/sorw">On the Death of
								Richard West</a>,</em> and in some lines in the fragmentary &quot;fourth book&quot; of
								his Latin poem <em><a
								href="/texts/diglib/primary/1775&amp;part=1/1/168">De
								Principiis Cogitandi</a>,</em> which was dedicated to West (see
								Letter 131 [<a href="/texts/letters/tgal0149">letters.0149</a>])."</p>
