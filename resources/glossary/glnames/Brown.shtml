								(i.e. Vice-Master) of Pembroke, 15 May 1749; Proctor, 1750-1; Master, 21
								Dec. 1770-84; D.D., 1771; Vice-Chancellor, 1771-2; Vicar of Stretham in
								Isle of Ely, 1771 (see Letter 540 [<a
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0619">letters.0619</a>]). He was a small man, precise in manner, and of a resolute
								courage. <a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Gray%2C%20Thomas%2C%201716-1771">Gray</a> writes in Letter 120:
								He 'wants nothing, but a Foot in
								height and his own Hair, to make him a little old Roman' [<A
								href="/cgi-bin/display.cgi?text=tgal0138">letters.0138</a>], and there are many other playful allusions to his diminutive
								stature. <a href="/resources/glnames.shtml#Cole%2C%20William%2C%201714-1782">Cole</a> describes him as 'a
								very worthy man, a good scholar, small and short-sighted'. He probably
								made Gray's
								acquaintance when an undergraduate (see Appendix B), and he was his
								sponsor when Gray was admitted as a Fellow-commoner at Pembroke (see
								Appendix E, n. 7). He was a loyal friend and admirer of Gray throughout
								his life. He was joint-executor with Mason of Gray's will, and was
								present at his burial at

								his brief illness (see his letters to Wharton and Nicholls in Appendix
								W)."</p>
